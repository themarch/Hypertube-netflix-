♫ <i>Sugar Man</i>

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.460
<i>(Stephen Segerman)</i>
<i>I got my nickname from this song.</i>

00:01:09.544 --> 00:01:13.923
When I was in the Army they used to
mispronounce Segerman as Sugar Man.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.218
And then they just started calling me
Sugar and that became my nickname.

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:23.808
<i>It's 40 years since this LP called</i>
Cold Fact <i>by Rodriguez was released.</i>

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:27.478
<i>And in South Africa</i>
<i>it was a very popular album.</i>

00:01:27.562 --> 00:01:30.356
<i>It was one of the biggest albums</i>
<i>of the day.</i>

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.526
<i>But the thing was,</i>
<i>we didn't know who this guy was.</i>

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.695
<i>All our other rock stars,</i>
<i>we had all the information we needed.</i>

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.198
<i>But this guy? There was nothing.</i>

00:01:39.282 --> 00:01:42.618
<i>And then we found out</i>
<i>that he had committed suicide.</i>

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:47.540
<i>He set himself alight on stage and</i>
<i>burnt to death in front of the audience.</i>

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.377
<i>It was the most incredible thing.</i>
<i>It wasn't just a suicide.</i>

00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:55.256
<i>It was probably the most</i>
<i>grotesque suicide in rock history.</i>

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:38.359
(thunder crashing)

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.268
<i>(Dennis Coffey)</i> The first time that
I remember actually recognising him is

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.853
Mike Theodore called me
on the phone one day and said,

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:17.815
''I have this artist
I want you to come see with me.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.692
''This guy's name is Rodriguez,

00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:21.735
''he's working down by the Detroit River.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.654
''There's a bar down there,

00:04:23.738 --> 00:04:26.282
''down by the wharf riverside district.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.741
''Let's go see him tonight.

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:29.076
''I think you'll really like him.''

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.455
<i>So that night, I remember,</i>
<i>we pull up...</i>

00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:36.709
<i>away in this kinda isolated</i>
<i>part of Detroit</i>

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:38.836
<i>right on the side of the Detroit River,</i>

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.756
<i>and you could see the mist in the air</i>
<i>coming off the river. We could feel it.</i>

00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:46.552
And we went inside there,
and as we walked in the door,

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:49.346
we could hear behind us
the sound of the freighters

00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:51.140
as they're going down the river,

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:54.560
and so it's like you're walking out
of a Sherlock Holmes novel.

00:04:54.644 --> 00:04:58.022
You walk out of the mist
and you go into this place,

00:04:58.106 --> 00:05:00.566
and inside the place,
it's all full of smoke,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.276
so there's a mist inside there.

00:05:02.694 --> 00:05:05.904
<i>(Mike Theodore) Boom, hey, you know,</i>
<i>it's a wall of smoke.</i>

00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:10.576
<i>Beer all over the place. Peanut shells.</i>
<i>It was just a mess.</i>

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.663
And then you hear this strumming sound.

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.707
Strumming and batting the guitar.

00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:18.709
(mimics guitar batting)

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:24.256
And then you hear this voice.
Strange voice.

00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:26.717
<i>(Coffey) Finally, we walked</i>
<i>through the smoke, and I looked,</i>

00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:29.261
<i>and there in the far corner I saw...</i>

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:32.681
I could see the shadow of a man
and I couldn't see his face.

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:35.726
I said, ''What's the deal?''
So we got a little closer...

00:05:37.395 --> 00:05:41.690
<i>(Theodore) And you see this guy</i>
<i>with his back to you.</i>

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:46.737
<i>So all you see is his back</i>
<i>and he's in a corner, singing.</i>

00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:50.949
<i>It was an ethereal scene, if you will.</i>

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:56.455
Foggy night, foghorns, smoke so thick
you couldn't see through it.

00:05:57.207 --> 00:05:59.083
<i>And here's this voice.</i>

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.627
<i>(Coffey) Maybe it forced you</i>
<i>to listen to the lyrics</i>

00:06:01.711 --> 00:06:03.712
<i>'cause you couldn't see the guy's face.</i>

00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:07.091
<i>That's when we talked to him and figured</i>
<i>we needed to do an album on him.</i>

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:11.470
The only writer that I had heard of,
of that time period,

00:06:11.554 --> 00:06:15.057
was maybe Bob Dylan,
that was writing that well.

<i>(Dan DiMaggio) He was this</i>
<i>wandering spirit around the city.</i>

00:07:38.475 --> 00:07:42.102
<i>And, uh, sometimes</i>
<i>I might catch him in the corner.</i>

00:07:42.187 --> 00:07:45.647
You know, Detroit's got its share of,
uh, burned-out, desolate areas

00:07:45.773 --> 00:07:48.942
and I would occasionally see him, um,

00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:51.987
far away from The Brewery,
and I wondered,

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.324
and it just added
to this mythology of him.

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:59.119
Like, what is he doing?
What is he doing? What does he do?

00:07:59.204 --> 00:08:03.790
I heard he did a little roofing,
some construction work.

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:06.960
Um, I think that's how he got his money
at the time.

00:08:07.045 --> 00:08:09.671
He just was, you know,
and I say this with love,

00:08:09.797 --> 00:08:12.132
I say this with respect, but,

00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:14.218
I thought he was just a...

00:08:14.886 --> 00:08:19.097
just not much more than a kind of
a homeless person, you know?

00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:22.226
He just was a drifter.
He was just... Um...

00:08:23.311 --> 00:08:26.188
<i>I didn't know if he had a home,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:30.275
<i>He'd look like maybe he'd go</i>
<i>from shelter to shelter or something.</i>

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:38.116
<i>(Coffey) Detroit in the '70s</i>
<i>was a hard place.</i>

00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:39.785
<i>Well, it's still a hard place.</i>

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:44.998
<i>Lot of decay, lots of ruined houses.</i>
<i>Real poverty exists in this city.</i>

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:48.460
<i>And those streets</i>
<i>were Rodriguez's natural habitat.</i>

00:08:48.545 --> 00:08:51.672
Any time we met him
to talk about what we were doing,

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:55.676
he would always meet us on a corner
somewhere in his neighbourhood.

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:58.262
Most of the time
he wasn't coming to my house.

00:08:58.346 --> 00:09:01.390
He'd say, ''Meet me on the corner
of this street and that street,''

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:02.975
and we would be there.

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:06.186
Uh, Mike and I would get out of our cars
and park our cars,

00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:07.646
so we'd be standing on the corner,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.398
and then we'd look round
and he'd be there all of a sudden.

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:10.941
He'd just show up.

00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:13.860
<i>We thought he was like</i>
<i>the inner city poet.</i>

00:09:13.945 --> 00:09:17.531
<i>You know? Putting his poems to music</i>
<i>of what he saw.</i>

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:20.826
<i>And it was definitely a very gritty look</i>

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.078
<i>at what he saw</i>
<i>on the streets of Detroit.</i>

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:26.665
<i>What he saw in his neighbourhood.</i>
<i>Who was walking around the streets.</i>

00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:31.837
<i>And the way he presented it in a song,</i>
<i>I thought was very, very interesting.</i>

00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:36.133
<i>(Theodore) We were working</i>
<i>at Tera-Shirma recording studio.</i>

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:40.596
<i>When he opened up and sang,</i>
<i>you went, ''Whoa, this guy's got it.''</i>

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:46.018
<i>Rodriguez, at that time,</i>
<i>had all the machinery in place.</i>

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:50.939
<i>Big names, big money behind it.</i>
<i>Circumstances were right.</i>

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:55.694
<i>Why didn't it make it? That's the</i>
<i>big question that today still haunts me.</i>

00:09:55.778 --> 00:09:59.448
Did he get enough promotion?
Did he do enough performances?

00:10:00.283 --> 00:10:02.034
Was he too political?

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.662
Was there this or was there that?

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.956
Should it have been green
instead of orange?

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:11.126
Should it have been a violin
instead of an oboe?

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.003
On and on you can go.

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:17.633
But the end of the day is, if you
listen to the stuff now, you'd say,

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:20.677
''I don't understand it, he's right-on.''

00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:24.973
<i>(Jerome Ferretti)</i>
<i>I only heard him play once,</i>

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:29.519
<i>and one of the songs that</i>
<i>he had on his album, it was called...</i>

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:34.399
The <i>Sugar Man?</i> Was it <i>Sugar Man?</i>
Is that the name of the song?

00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:37.361
Um, I knew that guy, the Sugar Man.

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:40.739
And his name was Volkswagen Cha...
Volkswagen Frank!

00:10:40.823 --> 00:10:42.240
And he lived right around the corner

00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:44.493
and you used to go over
to Volkswagen Frank's.

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.704

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:44.636
that I've kept since my days in England
with Rodriguez.

00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:46.388
Let me see.

00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:49.808
Possibly it's in this book,
I don't know where.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.229
These are all my photos
from when I was acting.

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:58.442
That's me, and that's Jimmy Dean.
That was in 1955.

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:02.821
Hang on, I think I've found them.
Think they're in here.

00:12:04.574 --> 00:12:06.324
Yeah, here they are.

00:12:07.452 --> 00:12:10.287
Wow. Good Lord, here they are.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:15.333
You know, I haven't seen these pictures
in almost 35 years.

00:12:18.296 --> 00:12:20.505
He's my most memorable artist.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.176
You know, I've produced
a lot of great ones, but...

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.680
he's my most memorable.

00:12:29.307 --> 00:12:31.183
<i>It's not just a talent.</i>

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:33.935
<i>He's like...</i>

00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:37.439
<i>He's like a wise man, a prophet.</i>

00:12:37.482 --> 00:12:41.193
<i>He's way beyond</i>
<i>just being a musical artist.</i>

00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:44.362
<i>And he probably could have done</i>
<i>fantastically well</i>

00:12:44.489 --> 00:12:45.864
<i>if he had have continued.</i>

00:12:45.948 --> 00:12:49.951
When I met him, they said,
''Rodriguez, this is Steve Rowland.

00:12:50.036 --> 00:12:52.871
''He really likes your album.''
And Rodriguez said to me,

00:12:52.955 --> 00:12:56.166
''Well, did you like <i>Cold Facts?''</i>

00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:58.835
I said, ''Man, I thought
it was absolutely brilliant.

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:00.378
''Absolutely brilliant.

00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:04.216
''I can't believe that this album
didn't do anything.

00:13:04.342 --> 00:13:06.885
''It's just a fantastic album.''

00:13:07.053 --> 00:13:08.512
So he played me...

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:12.724
Well, his next album was on...
In those days you had cassettes.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.312
He had demos of this next album that
he was gonna call <i>Coming From Reality</i>.

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:22.567
And I said, ''Wow, man,
this has got to be a smash.

00:13:22.693 --> 00:13:24.236
''These are great songs.

00:13:24.362 --> 00:13:29.908
''Little bit... Little bit different from
the others,'' I said, ''but great songs.''

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:33.245
I said, ''And a couple of them
were so sad.'' You know.

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:36.581
There's one in there
that's absolutely a killer.

00:13:36.707 --> 00:13:38.708
It's one of the saddest songs that...

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:43.839
I'm laughing, but it's one of
the saddest songs that I've ever heard.

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:47.217

And what makes it even sadder

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:13.678
was the album was released
in November of 1971,

00:15:14.972 --> 00:15:18.975
and we expected big things.
And it did absolutely nothing.

00:15:21.354 --> 00:15:24.356
And then, two weeks before Christmas,

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:28.318
Sussex dropped him off the label.

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:33.490
And the very first line in the song,
as if premonition,

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:37.410
was, ''I lost my job
two weeks before Christmas.''

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:42.499
Oh, man. I just think about that.

00:15:43.668 --> 00:15:47.671
This guy deserves recognition.

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:52.050
Nobody in America had even heard of him.

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:54.886
Nobody...

00:15:57.264 --> 00:16:00.350
Nobody even was interested
in listening to him.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.399
How can that be? How can that be?
Guy that writes like this.

00:18:00.638 --> 00:18:04.015

it spread very quickly.

<i>(Willem Möller)</i>
I remember I was in high school

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:30.375
and we heard this song, ''I wonder
how many times you've had sex?''

00:18:30.417 --> 00:18:33.044
And at that time South Africa
was very conservative.

00:18:33.087 --> 00:18:35.421
It was the height of apartheid,

00:18:36.173 --> 00:18:38.383
and there wasn't television here.

00:18:38.425 --> 00:18:41.886
That's how conservative it was,
'cause television was communist.

00:18:41.929 --> 00:18:44.681
It was really... You wouldn't believe.

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:47.725
Everything was restricted,
everything was censored.

00:18:47.852 --> 00:18:49.227
Everything was...

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.437
And here's this guy singing this song.

00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:54.232
<i>''Who's that?'' Said, ''That's Rodriguez.''</i>

00:18:54.275 --> 00:18:58.570

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:01.781
<i>But the strange thing was</i>
<i>that we all bought his records.</i>

00:19:01.866 --> 00:19:04.742
Everybody I knew had his records.
<i>I Wonder,</i>

00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:07.036
that was the big song
that everybody was singing

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.580
and we all bought a record.

00:19:08.622 --> 00:19:12.292
And there he was on the cover,
sort of a hippy with shades.

00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:15.545
But nobody knew anything about him.
He was a mystery.

00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:19.465
Unlike other artists
that you could read about from America,

00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:24.095
get to know something about them,
there was zilch. Nobody knew anything.

00:19:24.138 --> 00:19:28.433
It was a mystery. We only had
his picture on the cover of the record.

<i>To many of us South Africans,</i>

00:20:01.008 --> 00:20:03.760

And you would always see
<i>Cold Fact</i> by Rodriguez.

00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:22.320
To us, it was one of the most
famous records of all time.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.782
<i>The message it had was:</i>
<i>''Be anti-establishment.''</i>

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:28.159
<i>One song's called</i>
Anti-Establishment Blues.

00:20:28.285 --> 00:20:29.953
We didn't know what the word
''anti-establishment'' was

00:20:29.995 --> 00:20:33.122
until it cropped up on a Rodriguez song
and then we found out,

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:36.167
it's OK to protest against your society,

00:20:36.293 --> 00:20:39.087
to be angry with your society.

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:42.340
Because we lived in a society

00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:45.927
where every means was used
to prevent apartheid from,

00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:49.013
you know, coming to an end,

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:53.518
this album somehow had in it...

00:20:53.602 --> 00:20:59.607
lyrics that almost set us free
as oppressed peoples.

00:21:01.277 --> 00:21:03.361
Any revolution needs an anthem

00:21:03.404 --> 00:21:06.239
and in South Africa
<i>Cold Fact</i> was the album

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.783
that gave people permission

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:13.955
to free their minds
and to start thinking differently.

<i>about the apartheid government</i>

00:22:13.849 --> 00:22:16.934
<i>but we didn't know</i>
<i>because they controlled the news.</i>

00:22:17.019 --> 00:22:20.271
<i>The majority of the population</i>
<i>had been marginalised</i>

00:22:20.314 --> 00:22:23.816
<i>and forced out of the commerce in areas.</i>

00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:25.693
<i>It was what had happened</i>
<i>in Nazi Germany.</i>

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:27.653
<i>It was a spin-off from Nazi Germany,</i>

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.698
<i>but if a newspaper published it,</i>
<i>they'd get prosecuted.</i>

00:22:30.783 --> 00:22:34.786
<i>So, because of that, South Africa had</i>
<i>achieved a pariah status in the world.</i>

00:22:34.828 --> 00:22:37.622
<i>There were cultural boycotts.</i>
<i>There were sporting boycotts.</i>

00:22:37.664 --> 00:22:41.125
<i>It was a very isolated society.</i>
<i>So we were cut off</i>.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.794
We all knew apartheid was wrong,

00:22:42.878 --> 00:22:44.045
but living in South Africa,

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:45.463
there wasn't much, as a white person,

00:22:45.631 --> 00:22:46.798
you could do about it,

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.633
'cause the government was very strict.

00:22:48.717 --> 00:22:50.802
It was a military state,
to a large degree.

00:22:50.886 --> 00:22:52.387
If you spoke out against apartheid,

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:54.472
you could be thrown into prison
for three years.

00:22:54.515 --> 00:22:57.809
<i>So although a lot of whites</i>
<i>were part of the struggle,</i>

00:22:57.851 --> 00:22:59.519
<i>the majority of whites were not.</i>

00:22:59.645 --> 00:23:03.981
<i>You were watched. There were spies.</i>
<i>It was scary and people were scared.</i>

00:23:04.066 --> 00:23:06.901
But out of the Afrikaans
community emerged

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:09.987
a group of Afrikaans
musicians, songwriters,

00:23:10.072 --> 00:23:14.325
and for them, when they heard Rodriguez,
it was like a voice spoke to them

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:18.329
and said, ''Guys, there's a way out.
There's a way out.

00:23:18.372 --> 00:23:21.499
''You can write music.
You can write imagery.

00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:23.167
''You can sing, you can perform.''

00:23:23.252 --> 00:23:27.004
And that was where, really,
the first opposition to apartheid

00:23:27.089 --> 00:23:29.674
came from inside
the Afrikaans community.

00:23:29.758 --> 00:23:33.177
It was these young Afrikaans guys
and, to a man,

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.763
they'll tell you
they were influenced by Rodriguez.

The guys who were regarded as the icons
of the Afrikaans music revolution

00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:48.067
will all tell you,
''Rodriguez was our guy.''

by the establishment isn't all theirs.

00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:26.731

he used to talk like that.

00:24:28.317 --> 00:24:30.985
<i>And this song said, ''switch it off,</i>
<i>just switch off the TV.''</i>

00:24:39.786 --> 00:24:41.162
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
So what lines do you think

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:42.830
were the lines they had problem with?

00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:44.415
Ah, gee whiz, it's all of them.

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:03.851
I'm gonna leave that to you.

00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:05.353
(both chuckle)

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:07.855
-But it's drugs?
-It's certainly drugs.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.859
During the apartheid years,
it was just impossible to play it.

00:25:11.944 --> 00:25:13.861
And what happened if you did play it?

00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:17.114
Well, you couldn't.
I'd like to show you why.

00:25:21.995 --> 00:25:24.872
Right, here we have the album,
the vinyl.

00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:28.459
At the back of the sleeve
you'll see a sticker that says ''Avoid.''

00:25:28.502 --> 00:25:32.296
But when you open the album
and take it out from its sleeve,

00:25:33.048 --> 00:25:36.509
you would see that they have
scratched that particular song

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:40.304
with a sharp tool to make sure
that it would not go out on air.

00:25:40.847 --> 00:25:45.351
<i>And that's the way that they</i>
<i>banned the music which, in my mind,</i>

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:50.147
<i>was quite a brutal way of ensuring the</i>
<i>song would never be heard on the air.</i>

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:54.151
<i>(Steve Harris) Most of those tracks</i>
<i>were on the banned list at SABC</i>

00:25:54.236 --> 00:25:57.572
<i>and they ran</i>
<i>the broadcast industry completely.</i>

00:25:57.656 --> 00:26:00.408
<i>There weren't any independent</i>
<i>radio stations or TV stations.</i>

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:06.205
Obviously, when that word got out,
it just made the record more desirable.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.000
You know,
it's like having something banned.

00:26:09.042 --> 00:26:12.587
You're 16, 17 years old
and you've got something that's banned.

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:14.589
It was absolutely perfect.

00:26:14.881 --> 00:26:17.174

<i>(Segerman)</i> Cold Fact <i>was just one</i>
<i>of the albums we had in our collections,</i>

00:27:06.933 --> 00:27:11.228
<i>and for 10, 20 years, it was just</i>
<i>a record we listened to and enjoyed.</i>

00:27:11.897 --> 00:27:15.441
<i>But then a pivotal event happened</i>
<i>that changed everything for me.</i>

00:27:15.525 --> 00:27:16.984
<i>We were down in Camps Bay beach.</i>

00:27:17.069 --> 00:27:20.196
We were sitting around on the beach
and a friend of mine,

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.573
a woman, who was from South Africa,

00:27:22.658 --> 00:27:26.869
but she had got married
and emigrated to Los Angeles,

00:27:26.953 --> 00:27:31.332
she said to me, ''Where can I
buy <i>Cold Fact</i> in South Africa?''

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:35.252
And I turned round and I pointed
to a store across the road

00:27:35.337 --> 00:27:38.589
that sold CDs and I said,
''You can buy it at that store.''

00:27:38.674 --> 00:27:42.259
She said, ''Really? Because, you know,
you can't buy it anywhere in America.

00:27:42.344 --> 00:27:44.553
''I've asked everywhere in America,
no one's even heard of it.''

00:27:44.638 --> 00:27:47.139
<i>And that was a pivotal moment,</i>
<i>'cause I didn't know that.</i>

00:27:47.224 --> 00:27:48.599
<i>I thought everybody knew Rodriguez,</i>

00:27:48.684 --> 00:27:51.227
<i>especially in America</i>
<i>'cause he was American.</i>

00:27:51.311 --> 00:27:54.438
<i>So my next thought was,</i>
<i>''Ah, Rodriguez, that's interesting.''</i>

00:27:54.523 --> 00:27:56.941
<i>I went back... I came back home</i>
<i>and I took out my Rodriguez records</i>

00:27:57.025 --> 00:27:59.443
<i>and that's when I realised</i>
<i>there was nothing on the record</i>

00:27:59.528 --> 00:28:01.696
<i>to tell us who he was</i>
<i>or where he was from.</i>

00:28:02.072 --> 00:28:03.948
On <i>Cold Fact</i> there are four names.

00:28:04.032 --> 00:28:06.909
On the front cover
it just says ''Rodriguez.''

00:28:06.993 --> 00:28:09.787
But if we take the record out
and examine the sleeve,

00:28:09.913 --> 00:28:12.707
the artist's name is Sixto Rodriguez.

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:14.291
<i>But if you look at the tracks,</i>

00:28:14.376 --> 00:28:16.001
<i>six of these tracks</i>

00:28:16.086 --> 00:28:18.462
<i>are credited to Jesus Rodriguez,</i>

00:28:18.547 --> 00:28:19.922
<i>and four of these tracks</i>

00:28:20.006 --> 00:28:22.633
<i>are credited to Sixth Prince.</i>

00:28:22.718 --> 00:28:24.385
<i>So who actually wrote these songs</i>

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:25.720
<i>and who are all these people?</i>

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:28.973
<i>We didn't have any more information</i>
<i>than a record</i>

00:28:29.057 --> 00:28:32.601
<i>with him sitting on the cover</i>
<i>with a hat and sunglasses on.</i>

00:28:32.686 --> 00:28:35.688
<i>We didn't know how tall he was</i>
<i>'cause he was sitting cross-legged.</i>

00:28:35.772 --> 00:28:37.231
<i>So how do you solve a mystery?</i>

00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:39.316
<i>You use whatever</i>
<i>information's available.</i>

00:28:39.401 --> 00:28:42.695
<i>What did we have?</i>
<i>A record cover with lyrics.</i>

00:28:42.779 --> 00:28:44.447
So we started looking
quite deeply at the lyrics

00:28:44.531 --> 00:28:45.990
and seeing what they said,

00:28:46.074 --> 00:28:48.701
and some of them, very few of them,
had geographical references.

00:28:48.785 --> 00:28:51.412
The one <i>You Can't Get Away</i> starts off,

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.122
''Born in the troubled city

00:28:53.206 --> 00:28:56.000
''In Rock and Roll, USA.''

00:28:56.084 --> 00:28:57.501
Born in which troubled city?

00:28:57.586 --> 00:28:59.670
Seems all the cities were troubled
in the late '60s.

00:28:59.755 --> 00:29:02.047
''In the shadow of the tallest building.''

00:29:02.132 --> 00:29:04.300
The tallest building, as far as we knew,
was in New York.

00:29:04.384 --> 00:29:06.719
And at the bottom of the song
this verse says,

00:29:06.803 --> 00:29:08.429
''In a hotel room in Amsterdam.''

00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:14.351
Then it says, ''Going down a dusty
Georgian side road I wander.'' Georgia?

00:29:14.436 --> 00:29:16.353
So we've had Amsterdam,
we've had Georgia,

00:29:16.438 --> 00:29:17.897
we've had the world's tallest building.

00:29:18.565 --> 00:29:20.274
Not much to go on.

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:29.450
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom)</i>
<i>Well, what I heard,</i>

00:29:29.493 --> 00:29:30.910
<i>and the story differs a lot,</i>

00:29:31.036 --> 00:29:34.622
<i>and a lot of people have different</i>
<i>versions of the story, but what I heard,</i>

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:37.416
<i>he hadn't played a concert</i>
<i>in a very long time.</i>

00:29:37.459 --> 00:29:41.378
And a promoter got him
to play a concert,

00:29:41.463 --> 00:29:44.131
and he was hoping
it was gonna be a great show.

00:29:44.216 --> 00:29:47.343
Of course, the show didn't
work out that way. It started out...

00:29:47.427 --> 00:29:51.430
The sound wasn't good.
The venue wasn't good.

00:29:51.473 --> 00:29:54.141
A lot of the factors
surrounding the show wasn't good.

00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:56.101
And as the show went on and on,

00:29:56.186 --> 00:30:00.773
it started going downhill from there.
People started ridiculing him.

00:30:00.857 --> 00:30:06.153
People started whistling
or making mention of the fact that,

00:30:06.238 --> 00:30:08.614
you know,
the show wasn't going as planned.

00:30:08.698 --> 00:30:12.284
And it got to a point where,
just very quietly, very gently,

00:30:12.369 --> 00:30:13.828
he just sang his last song.

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:16.580
''But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine

00:30:16.665 --> 00:30:18.624
''And after that's said forget it.''

00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:23.045
And he reached down and pulled up a gun
and pulled the trigger.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.799
And that was the dramatic,
very dramatic ending,

00:30:26.883 --> 00:30:29.468
to what was actually a non-career.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.670
<i>(Segerman)</i> In 1996,
the South African record label

00:31:04.754 --> 00:31:08.966
released Rodriguez's second album,
<i>Coming From Reality,</i>

00:31:09.092 --> 00:31:11.886
on CD for the first time
in South Africa.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.471
And because they thought
I knew a lot about him,

00:31:14.514 --> 00:31:17.224
they asked if I wanted to co-write
the liner notes for the booklet,

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:18.684
which I did.

00:31:18.768 --> 00:31:23.147
And I'll read some of it to you.
They start off by saying,

00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:26.650
''If ever there is an air of intrigue
and mystery around a pop artist,

00:31:26.735 --> 00:31:29.445
''it is around the artist
known as Rodriguez.

00:31:29.529 --> 00:31:32.656
''There's no air of intrigue and mystery
around him anywhere else in the world

00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:35.868
''because his two albums,
<i>Coming From Reality</i> and <i>Cold Fact,</i>

00:31:35.952 --> 00:31:38.746
''were monumental flops everywhere else.''

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.289
And this is the important part.

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:44.960
''There were no concrete cold facts
about the artist known as Rodriguez.

00:31:45.045 --> 00:31:47.463
''Any musicologist detectives out there?''

00:31:47.964 --> 00:31:50.758
And that,
that's the line that changed everything.

00:31:51.885 --> 00:31:53.677
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom)</i>
<i>I started searching for Rodriguez</i>

00:31:53.762 --> 00:31:55.971
<i>when a few of us</i>
<i>were sitting around in the Army</i>

00:31:56.056 --> 00:31:58.432
<i>and somebody said,</i>
<i>''How did Rodriguez die?''</i>

00:31:58.516 --> 00:31:59.892
And just coincidence,

00:31:59.976 --> 00:32:02.394
at the time I was looking
for subject matter to write an article.

00:32:02.479 --> 00:32:05.356
<i>I remember having, like, five points</i>
<i>on a piece of paper.</i>

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.776
<i>And number four, or something,</i>
<i>was ''Find out how Rodriguez died.''</i>

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.570
<i>I thought it would make a good story.</i>

00:32:11.613 --> 00:32:13.697
So that was in the back of my mind
for many years

00:32:13.782 --> 00:32:17.534
and then, many years later,
I came across this, um,

00:32:18.078 --> 00:32:23.415
re-release of <i>Coming From Reality</i>
and inside, the liner notes said,

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.877
''There were no concrete cold facts
about the artist known as Rodriguez.

00:32:26.962 --> 00:32:31.590
''Any musicologist detectives out there?''
Um, was the question,

00:32:31.675 --> 00:32:33.801
and I think that to me,
was like an invitation.

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:35.970
I thought, ''Well, maybe it's me''.

00:32:38.431 --> 00:32:42.768
<i>The first way I tried to find him</i>
<i>was to just follow the money.</i>

00:32:42.852 --> 00:32:44.103
Normally, you follow the money.

00:32:44.229 --> 00:32:45.604
That's how you get
to the bottom of anything.

00:32:46.272 --> 00:32:48.607
<i>But where do dead men's money go?</i>

00:32:48.692 --> 00:32:51.068
<i>I was astounded that</i>
<i>no one knew anything about him.</i>

00:32:51.194 --> 00:32:55.489
<i>I guess it was reminiscent</i>
<i>of how bad the music industry was.</i>

00:32:55.573 --> 00:32:57.408
<i>They were renowned</i>
<i>for ripping people off.</i>

00:32:57.492 --> 00:33:01.412
And it is one thing,
if they had said to me, ''Oh, yeah,

00:33:01.496 --> 00:33:05.833
''we send the money
to X place or Y,'' or whatever,

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:08.210
but they just kept on being very vague.

00:33:08.294 --> 00:33:12.047
<i>And, in fact, when I put some pressure</i>
<i>on somebody, I did get an address,</i>

00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.632
<i>and I called</i>

00:33:13.717 --> 00:33:16.635
<i>and, I can't remember</i>
<i>if I spoke to someone or left a message,</i>

00:33:16.678 --> 00:33:19.638
<i>but when I called the next day,</i>
<i>the number had been changed.</i>

00:33:19.681 --> 00:33:20.848
<i>And that to me was...</i>

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:24.351
I mean, that's a gift
for anyone who wants to be a detective,

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:28.897
is an obstacle,
because an obstacle is an inspiration.

00:33:28.982 --> 00:33:31.608
If you just find things easily,
they're not inspiring,

00:33:31.651 --> 00:33:34.945
and this was a great obstacle
that somebody had changed their number.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:39.450
I just smelt a dirty money story
somewhere there.

00:33:39.534 --> 00:33:41.243
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
<i>So, if you compare to other artists,</i>

00:33:41.327 --> 00:33:42.953
<i>how big was it actually?</i>

00:33:43.038 --> 00:33:45.080
<i>(Robbie Mann) Every month it just sold.</i>

00:33:45.165 --> 00:33:48.042
<i>And every party you went to</i>
<i>and every place you went to,</i>

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:50.544
<i>you'd hear that album at least once.</i>

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:55.007
I don't think I could even think
of how many albums he's sold here

00:33:55.091 --> 00:33:57.551
'cause it's a long period of time.

00:33:57.927 --> 00:34:00.721
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
What could be probable?

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.724
(sighs)

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:08.020
I'd have to guess. Maybe half a million
copies over that period of time.

00:34:08.938 --> 00:34:11.774
<i>It's a lot of records,</i>
<i>especially for a small country.</i>

00:34:11.858 --> 00:34:14.318
<i>Gold record, ten times over.</i>

00:34:14.402 --> 00:34:17.154
<i>(male interviewer)</i> Rodriguez never got
to know that he was big in South Africa.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.697
How could that be?

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.034
Don't know.
I mean, everything would have been...

00:34:22.118 --> 00:34:23.702
I find that strange.

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:26.038
<i>I have no idea.</i>

00:34:26.122 --> 00:34:28.165
<i>(male interviewer) But you must</i>
<i>have sent royalties somewhere?</i>

00:34:28.291 --> 00:34:30.918
<i>(Mann) Of course we sent royalties.</i>
<i>We sent royalties to A&M Records.</i>

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:33.295
<i>I remember the label. It was A&M Sussex.</i>

00:34:33.379 --> 00:34:36.298
<i>Whether they had a partnership,</i>
<i>whatever they had, I don't... You know.</i>

00:34:36.925 --> 00:34:41.136
So, my suggestion is, if you
can find out whoever the person was

00:34:41.221 --> 00:34:42.888
who owned Sussex Records,

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.391
then you will find out
what happened to the money.

00:34:46.476 --> 00:34:49.186
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
<i>Because it's weird, isn't it?</i>

00:34:49.312 --> 00:34:52.439
<i>(Mann) It's very strange. Very strange.</i>

00:34:52.524 --> 00:34:54.733
<i>(male interviewer)</i> How popular
was the album? Was he as famous as,

00:34:54.776 --> 00:34:56.944
you know,
the Rolling Stones and the Doors?

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.821
Oh, it was much bigger
than Rolling Stones.

00:34:58.905 --> 00:35:00.364
Absolutely, at the time, yeah.

00:35:00.907 --> 00:35:03.784
<i>(male interviewer) When you released</i>
<i>the record, did you try to contact him?</i>

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:07.663
<i>(Harris)</i> No, not at all. You know?
Because... because, at the time,

00:35:07.747 --> 00:35:11.750
the legend... the legend was...
here was an artist.

00:35:11.793 --> 00:35:13.710
This was like Jimi Hendrix.

00:35:13.753 --> 00:35:16.463
With Jimi Hendrix catalogues,
you've gotta understand,

00:35:16.548 --> 00:35:21.969
if you just got Jimi Hendrix and you'd
got the licence for this territory,

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:25.472
you're obviously not gonna go try get
hold of Jimi Hendrix, because he's dead.

00:35:25.557 --> 00:35:28.475
-But who did you pay royalties to?
-To Sussex Music.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.935
To Clarence?

00:35:30.019 --> 00:35:33.272
Yes. Well, to Sussex Music
which is his company, yeah.

00:35:33.606 --> 00:35:35.566
So, I decided to make a diagram.

00:35:35.608 --> 00:35:38.819
Write down the whole path
and trail that I was trying to work out.

00:35:38.903 --> 00:35:41.572
All the various touch points,
all the record companies,

00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:45.075
all the people that had dealings with
Rodriguez and his album at some point.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.077
<i>I made this whole document.</i>

00:35:47.162 --> 00:35:49.746
<i>So I found out there were three</i>
<i>record companies in South Africa</i>

00:35:49.789 --> 00:35:52.291
<i>that had released Rodriguez's records.</i>

00:35:52.417 --> 00:35:56.044
<i>Finally discovering that</i>
<i>led to a record company in America.</i>

00:35:56.129 --> 00:35:57.921
<i>It was a company that</i>
<i>had been signing Rodriguez</i>

00:35:58.006 --> 00:36:00.841
<i>and creating his first album</i>
<i>called Sussex.</i>

00:36:01.676 --> 00:36:03.719
<i>I then did my research on Sussex.</i>

00:36:03.803 --> 00:36:05.971
<i>That led me to discovering</i>

00:36:06.055 --> 00:36:10.475
<i>who the owner of Sussex Records was:</i>
<i>Clarence Avant.</i>

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.811
<i>Clarence Avant,</i>
<i>he'd been the head of Motown,</i>

00:36:12.854 --> 00:36:16.481
<i>one of the most prestigious jobs</i>
<i>to have in the record company industry.</i>

00:36:16.566 --> 00:36:20.277
So I did my research. I tried everything
to get a hold of Clarence Avant,

00:36:20.403 --> 00:36:23.822
but I just got to a lot of closed doors.
I could not get a hold of him.

00:36:36.044 --> 00:36:39.296
<i>(male interviewer)</i> I don't know
if you've ever seen this picture.

00:36:39.422 --> 00:36:42.049
(chuckles) That's him.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.053
That's Rodriguez.

00:36:47.597 --> 00:36:49.890
I don't know when this was made.
I have absolutely no idea.

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:52.893
-That's 1970, I think.
-Yeah.

00:36:55.271 --> 00:36:57.189
This is my man.

00:37:01.361 --> 00:37:03.862
Man, don't get me emotional again. Shit.

00:37:03.905 --> 00:37:05.322
You made me emotional once.

00:37:05.448 --> 00:37:08.909
I ain't getting emotional no more
sitting here talking to you, man.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:14.790
<i>If I had to name ten artists</i>
<i>that I have ever been involved with,</i>

00:37:14.874 --> 00:37:17.626
<i>Rodriguez would be in the top five,</i>
<i>simple as that.</i>

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.753
<i>There's nothing...</i>
<i>You never heard anything like him.</i>

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:23.215
<i>People would say, ''Well, Bob Dylan.''</i>
<i>I said, ''No, no''.</i>

00:37:23.299 --> 00:37:27.636
<i>Bob Dylan was mild to this guy.</i>
<i>Did it make any money?</i>

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.972
We judge singing here in America...

00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:33.517
If you say,
''Is it... Was it the top hundred?

00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:37.771
''Was it... was it number...
Did it get on the charts as number 12?

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:41.275
''Was there a lot of radio play?''
The answer's, ''No, man.''

00:37:42.652 --> 00:37:44.861
Nobody didn't... Rodriguez?

00:37:46.114 --> 00:37:48.699
You know, that name didn't register.

00:37:49.492 --> 00:37:52.369
Although he looked like he was
a white guy but, even still, Rodriguez,

00:37:52.495 --> 00:37:55.372
everybody knew Rodriguez,
that's a Spanish name.

00:37:55.498 --> 00:37:58.292
A Latin name.
Latin music was not happening then.

00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:00.877
<i>(male interviewer)</i> How many records
do you think he sold in America?

00:38:00.962 --> 00:38:03.171
In America? Six.

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:05.299
Maybe my wife bought it,
maybe my daughter bought...

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:09.011
She couldn't buy it, but maybe
Neil Bogart, maybe Dennis and Mike.

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:13.390
Hey, look, man, you know,
it didn't sell here.

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:16.893
<i>There was some excitement about him.</i>

00:38:16.978 --> 00:38:21.356
<i>Couple of agents heard him</i>
<i>and wanted to bring him to California</i>

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:24.568
<i>and, you know, when he came</i>
<i>to California he was nervous,</i>

00:38:24.694 --> 00:38:26.737
<i>and he turned his back to the audience</i>

00:38:26.863 --> 00:38:29.031
<i>and everybody said,</i>
<i>''Well, what the hell is this?''</i>

00:38:29.073 --> 00:38:30.574
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
<i>But the thing is that the guy sold</i>

00:38:30.658 --> 00:38:33.410
<i>hundreds of thousands of records</i>
<i>in another country.</i>

00:38:33.536 --> 00:38:35.746
<i>(Avant) I'm going to South Africa to try</i>
<i>to chase somebody who's selling records?</i>

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.205
<i>Shit, no, man.</i>

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:39.916
<i>(male interviewer) But did you know</i>
<i>that he was big in South Africa?</i>

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:44.921
Rodriguez, young man, never happened
insofar as I'm concerned.

00:38:45.048 --> 00:38:46.423
Period.

00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:50.844
But if I'm really gonna try to track
down the money, how should I do it?

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:53.430
Well, is that important, the money?
Or is Rod...

00:38:53.556 --> 00:38:58.935
Which is important? Rodriguez's story
or you worrying about the money?

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.604
How many people in South Africa?

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.440
40 million? 40 thousand?
40 million people? How many people?

00:39:03.566 --> 00:39:05.025
40 million people live in South Africa.

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:08.737
Well, so they've been freed
for how long? Three hours?

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.238
So what the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:12.949
You told me at lunch,
they scratch records

00:39:13.076 --> 00:39:14.701
because they wouldn't let the lyrics...

00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:18.288
So the underground movement,
how big was it? How big was it?

00:39:18.414 --> 00:39:20.957
<i>(male interviewer)</i> He sold
half a million records in South Africa.

00:39:21.084 --> 00:39:22.876
So he sold half a million records.
So what?

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.711
I don't know who he sold them to.

00:39:24.796 --> 00:39:27.631
How many distributors did he have?
I have no idea.

00:39:27.715 --> 00:39:29.216
There are only...
There are three record labels.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.134
-I spoke to all the record label...
-Well, great.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.972
...bosses in South Africa who
has released his records. It was...

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.725
Go back to 'em and tell 'em
to send me an account.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:41.228
You think it's something
I'm gonna worry about, a 1970 contract?

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:43.980
If you do,
you're outta your goddamn mind.

00:39:44.107 --> 00:39:47.818
Buddha Records out of business.
I'm out of business.

00:39:48.945 --> 00:39:53.156
So you think they give a shit
about that? I know I wouldn't.

00:39:55.785 --> 00:39:57.160
<i>(Segerman)</i>
<i>I've been looking for information</i>

00:39:57.286 --> 00:39:58.912
