WEBVTT

00:00:00.574 --> 00:00:02.455
Get away from me!

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:04.304
<i>Previously on "Teen Wolf"...</i>

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:05.802
I want to go out with Allison.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:07.239
I kissed her.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.965
I saw.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.231
I want a semi-freaking normal life.

00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:13.331
Medical examiner determines killer
of girl to be animal, not human.

00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:14.632
Derek not killer.

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:15.790
Let out of jail.

00:00:16.138 --> 00:00:17.472
You did this to me!

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:18.397
The bite is a gift.

00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:19.366
I don't want it.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:20.765
You will.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:22.698
Who are they?

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.532
Hunters.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.864
That's my dad.

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:26.930
Everything in my life is

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:27.796
somehow perfect.

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:28.932
Why are you trying to ruin it?

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.600
You're cursed, Scott.

00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:45.850
Come on.

00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:47.328
Where are you taking me?

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.268
Somewhere where
we can be alone.

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.435
We are alone.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.771

can be more alone.

Get away.

00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:03.807
Scott?

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:11.106
Scott?

00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:13.841
Get away from me.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.028
So you killed her?

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.028
I don't know.

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.560
I just woke up.

00:03:10.561 --> 00:03:12.026
And I was sweating like crazy,

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:13.059
and I couldn't breathe.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.026
I've never had a dream where

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.059
I woke up like that before.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.061
Really? I have.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.860
Usually ends a little differently.

00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.026
"A," I meant I've never had

00:03:19.027 --> 00:03:20.093
a dream that felt that real,

00:03:20.094 --> 00:03:21.392
and "B," never give me that much

00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:22.594
detail about you in bed again.

00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:24.060
Noted.

00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:25.126
Let me take a guess here.

00:03:25.127 --> 00:03:26.425
No, I know, you think it has

00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:28.260
something to do with me going
out with Allison tomorrow,

00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:30.262
like I'm gonna lose control
and rip her throat out.

00:03:30.263 --> 00:03:31.962
No, of course not.

00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:34.294
Yeah, that's totally it.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:36.795
Hey, come on, it's gonna
be fine, all right?

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:37.794
Personally, I think you're

00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:39.627
handling this pretty
freakin' amazingly.

00:03:39.628 --> 00:03:41.544
You know, it's not like
there's a lycanthropy

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:43.050
for beginners class you can take.

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.761
Yeah, not a class,
but maybe a teacher.

00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:48.628
Who, Derek?

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.862
You forgetting the part where
we got him tossed in jail?

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.205
Yeah, I know, but chasing her,

00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:55.408
dragging her to the back of
the bus, it felt so real.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:56.506
How real?

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:59.342
Like it actually happened.

00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:08.908
I think it did.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
<font color="#FF8C00">Sync by YYeTs.net | Corrected by Alice</font>
<font color="#FF8C00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:14.206
She's probably fine.

00:04:14.207 --> 00:04:15.342
She's not answering my texts,

00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:16.341
Stiles.

00:04:16.342 --> 00:04:17.273
It could just be

00:04:17.274 --> 00:04:18.607
a coincidence, all right?

00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:20.407
A seriously amazing coincidence.

00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:23.673
Just help me find her, okay?

00:04:23.674 --> 00:04:24.674
Do you see her?

00:04:24.675 --> 00:04:26.375
No.

00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:59.606
You scared the hell outta me.

00:04:59.607 --> 00:05:00.974
You're okay.

00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:03.259
Once my heart starts
beating again, yeah.

00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:08.240
What?

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.641
I'm just happy to see you.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.873
Attention, students,
this is your principal.

00:05:11.874 --> 00:05:14.540
I know you're all wondering about
the incident that occurred

00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:16.074
last night to one of our buses.

00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:18.773
While the police work to
determine what happened,

00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:21.774
classes will proceed as scheduled.

00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:25.974
Save me a seat at lunch?

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:28.741
Yeah.

00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:40.803
What are you looking at, asswipe?

00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:50.524
Maybe it was my blood on the door.

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:51.893
Could have been animal blood.

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:54.394
You know, maybe you caught
a rabbit or something.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:55.660
And did what?

00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:56.760
Ate it.

00:05:56.761 --> 00:05:57.472
Raw?

00:05:57.473 --> 00:05:59.472
No, you stopped to bake it
in a little werewolf oven.

00:05:59.473 --> 00:06:01.707
I don't know, you're the one
who can't remember anything.

00:06:01.708 --> 00:06:04.740
Mr. Stilinksi, if that's your
idea of a hushed whisper,

00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:07.606
you might want to pull the headphones
out every once in a while.

00:06:07.607 --> 00:06:10.439
I think you and Mr. McCall would
benefit from a little distance,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.306
yes?

00:06:11.307 --> 00:06:14.740
No.

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:18.040
Let me know if the separation
anxiety gets to be too much.

00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:32.407
Hey, I think they found something.

00:06:38.107 --> 00:06:40.573
That's not a rabbit.

00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:42.140
Ahh!

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.139
Okay.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.740
This is good, this is good.

00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:48.473
He got up, he's not dead.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.773
Dead guys can't do that.

00:06:51.774 --> 00:06:54.907
Stiles...

00:06:54.908 --> 00:06:56.674
I did that.

00:07:01.578 --> 00:07:03.644
But dreams aren't memories.

00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:05.040
Then it wasn't a dream.

00:07:05.812 --> 00:07:06.941
Something happened last night,

00:07:06.942 --> 00:07:08.495
and I can't remember what.

00:07:10.344 --> 00:07:12.554
What makes you so sure that
Derek even has all the answers?

00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:16.185
Because during the full
moon he wasn't changed.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.494
He was in total control
while I was running around

00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:20.518
in the middle of the night attacking
some totally innocent guy.

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:21.520
You don't know that.

00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:23.220
I don't not know it.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.759
I can't go out with Allison.
I have to cancel.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.114
No, you're not cancelling, okay?

00:07:27.115 --> 00:07:28.816
You can't just cancel
your entire life.

00:07:28.817 --> 00:07:31.116
We'll figure it out.

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:33.049
Figure what out?

00:07:35.283 --> 00:07:36.961
Just, uh, homework.

00:07:36.962 --> 00:07:37.890
Yeah.

00:07:39.168 --> 00:07:40.532
Why is she sitting with us?

00:07:43.443 --> 00:07:44.455
Thanks.

00:07:52.668 --> 00:07:53.552
Get up.

00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:55.855
How come you never
ask Danny to get up?

00:07:55.856 --> 00:08:00.021
Because I don't stare at his
girlfriend's coin slot.

00:08:00.532 --> 00:08:02.586
So I hear they're saying it's
some type of animal attack.

00:08:02.587 --> 00:08:03.620
Probably a cougar.

00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:04.755
I heard mountain lion.

00:08:04.756 --> 00:08:07.354
A cougar is a mountain lion.

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:08.487
Isn't it?

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.621
Who cares?

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:10.753
The guy's probably some homeless

00:08:10.754 --> 00:08:12.019
tweaker who's gonna die anyway.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.922
Actually,
I just found out who it is.

00:08:13.923 --> 00:08:15.687
Check it out.

00:08:15.688 --> 00:08:18.154
The Sheriff's department won't
speculate on details of

00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:20.954
the incident but confirmed
the victim, Garrison Meyers,

00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:22.287
did survive the attack.

00:08:22.288 --> 00:08:24.465
Meyers was taken
to a local hospital

00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:26.487
where he remains
in critical condition.

00:08:26.488 --> 00:08:27.854
I know this guy.

00:08:27.855 --> 00:08:28.854
You do?

00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:29.853
Yeah, when I used to take

00:08:29.854 --> 00:08:31.788
the bus back when
I lived with my dad.

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:33.854
He was the driver.

00:08:33.855 --> 00:08:36.621
Can we talk about something
slightly more fun, please?

00:08:36.622 --> 00:08:40.287
Like, oh, where are we
going tomorrow night?

00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:44.020
You said you and Scott were hanging
out tomorrow night, right?

00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:47.220
Um, we were thinking of
what we were gonna do.

00:08:47.221 --> 00:08:50.621
Well, I am not sitting home
again watching lacrosse videos,

00:08:50.622 --> 00:08:52.480
so if the four of us
are hanging out,

00:08:53.106 --> 00:08:54.321
we are doing something fun.

00:08:54.322 --> 00:08:56.587
Hanging out?

00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:58.420
Like, the four of us?

00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:02.020
Do you wanna hang out,
like us and them?

00:09:02.021 --> 00:09:04.120
Yeah, I guess.

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:05.420
Sounds fun.

00:09:05.421 --> 00:09:07.420
You know what else sounds fun?

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:11.454
Stabbing myself in the face
with this fork.

00:09:11.455 --> 00:09:12.486
How 'bout bowling?

00:09:12.487 --> 00:09:13.622
You love to bowl.

00:09:13.623 --> 00:09:16.087
Yeah, with actual competition.

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:19.854
How do you know we're
not actual competition?

00:09:19.855 --> 00:09:22.153
You can bowl, right?

00:09:22.154 --> 00:09:23.487
Sort of.

00:09:23.488 --> 00:09:26.120
Is it sort of, or yes?

00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:29.287
Yes.

00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:33.029
In fact, I'm a great bowler.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.375
You're a terrible bowler.

00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:36.343
I know!

00:09:36.344 --> 00:09:37.175
I'm such an idiot.

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.456
God, it was like
watching a car wreck.

00:09:38.457 --> 00:09:41.809
I mean, first it turned into
the whole group date thing.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.506
And then out of nowhere
comes that  phrase.

00:09:43.507 --> 00:09:44.528
Hang out.

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:46.092
You don't hang out
with hot girls, okay?

00:09:46.093 --> 00:09:47.228
It's like death.

00:09:47.476 --> 00:09:49.185
Once it's hanging out,
you might

00:09:49.186 --> 00:09:50.236
as well be her
gay best friend.

00:09:50.237 --> 00:09:51.656
You and Danny
can start hanging out.

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:52.584
How is this happening?

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:54.516
I either killed
a guy or I didn't.

00:09:54.517 --> 00:09:56.421
I don't think Danny
likes me very much.

00:09:56.422 --> 00:09:58.456
I ask Allison on a date,
and now we're hanging out.

00:09:58.457 --> 00:10:00.147
Am I not attractive
to gay guys?

00:10:00.148 --> 00:10:02.791
I make first line, and the team
captain wants to destroy me,

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:04.885
and now--now
I'm gonna be late for work.

00:10:04.886 --> 00:10:07.125
Wait, Scott, you didn't--

00:10:07.126 --> 00:10:09.042
am I attractive to gay guy--

00:10:09.736 --> 00:10:11.110
you didn't answer my question.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.168
That's cool.

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:21.889
Sorry.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.255
Sorry.

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:25.889
You're all of two minutes late.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.088
I just don't want you
to think I'm slacking.

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:29.889
Scott, I guarantee you,

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.222
you're one of the least
slacking kids in this town.

00:10:47.523 --> 00:10:51.255
Hey, I see somebody's ready
to get their stitches out.

00:10:51.256 --> 00:10:52.356
Hey there, Scott.

00:10:52.357 --> 00:10:54.189
You staying out of trouble?

00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:58.921
Yeah.

00:10:58.922 --> 00:11:00.422
Hey, listen,
while I'm here,

00:11:00.423 --> 00:11:01.523
you mind taking
a look at those

00:11:01.524 --> 00:11:03.321
pictures I was telling
you about?

00:11:03.322 --> 00:11:05.321
Sacramento still can't
determine an  animal.

00:11:05.322 --> 00:11:08.388
I'm not exactly an expert.

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:11.188
This is the guy who was
attacked in the bus?

00:11:11.189 --> 00:11:12.655
Yeah.

00:11:12.656 --> 00:11:15.221
And we found wolf hairs
on Laura hale's body.

00:11:15.222 --> 00:11:16.830
A wolf?

00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:21.789
I mean, I think
I read somewhere

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.422
that wolves haven't been in
California for, like, 60 years.

00:11:24.423 --> 00:11:27.455
True enough, but wolves
are highly migratory.

00:11:27.456 --> 00:11:29.656
They could have wandered in
from another state driven by

00:11:29.657 --> 00:11:32.422
impulse or strong
enough memory.

00:11:32.423 --> 00:11:34.588
Wolves have memories?

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:36.755
Longer-term memories, yes.

00:11:36.756 --> 00:11:39.455
If associated with
a primal drive.

00:11:39.456 --> 00:11:40.523
See this one here?

00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:41.455
Yeah.

00:11:41.456 --> 00:11:42.687
Those are claw marks.

00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:43.790
A wolf would have gone for

00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:46.954
the throat or the spinal
cord with its teeth.

00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:48.288
So what do you think,

00:11:48.289 --> 00:11:49.523
it's a mountain lion?

00:11:49.524 --> 00:11:51.355
I don't know.

00:11:51.356 --> 00:11:53.586
A wolf could chase
down its prey,

00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:56.723
hobbling it by
tearing at the ankles.

00:12:00.156 --> 00:12:02.324
And then the throat.

00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:11.288
Is my beautiful, talented,

00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:14.221
and wonderful son actually
bringing me dinner?

00:12:14.222 --> 00:12:15.256
Thought you wouldn't mind

00:12:15.257 --> 00:12:16.822
skipping the cafeteria tonight.

00:12:16.823 --> 00:12:18.889
You are the most thoughtful,

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.255
loving, most conniving
little con artist ever.

00:12:22.256 --> 00:12:24.822
You are so not getting
the car tomorrow night.

00:12:24.823 --> 00:12:25.755
Mom.

00:12:25.756 --> 00:12:26.755
What?

00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:29.088
There's a curfew, no car.

00:12:29.089 --> 00:12:31.688
But I will take this.

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:33.722
Love you.

00:12:33.723 --> 00:12:36.289
Love you too.

00:13:17.289 --> 00:13:19.890
Mr. meyers.

00:13:26.456 --> 00:13:30.523
Are you okay?

00:13:40.103 --> 00:13:41.888
What the hell
are you doing in here?

00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:42.756
Get out!

00:13:42.757 --> 00:13:45.156
Now, go! Go, go.

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:19.188
It looks pretty deserted,
dispatch.

00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:20.704
Did you want me
to take a look inside?

00:14:21.122 --> 00:14:23.188
Unit 16, it's county property.

00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:25.255
Order's to make
sure it's vacant.

00:14:25.256 --> 00:14:28.954
I don't--I don't
think anyone's home.

00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:30.522
For the love of God, 16,

00:14:30.523 --> 00:14:32.341
go inside and see
if anyone's there.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.644
Copy that.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.872
Don't do that.

00:15:13.324 --> 00:15:14.906
Okay, I'm coming.

00:15:15.446 --> 00:15:16.500
I'm coming.

00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:39.624
I know you can hear me.

00:15:42.582 --> 00:15:43.866
I need your help.

00:15:53.765 --> 00:15:55.864
Okay.

00:15:55.865 --> 00:15:57.498
I know I was part
of you getting arrested

00:15:57.499 --> 00:16:00.085
and that we basically announced
you being here to the hunters.

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:03.080
I also don't know what
happened to your sister.

00:16:03.992 --> 00:16:06.825
But I think I did
something last night.

00:16:06.826 --> 00:16:09.925
I had a dream about... someone.

00:16:09.926 --> 00:16:11.825
But someone else got hurt.

00:16:11.826 --> 00:16:14.274
And it turns out that part of the
dream might have actually happened.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.268
You think you
attacked the driver?

00:16:16.734 --> 00:16:18.466
Did you see what
I did last night?

00:16:18.467 --> 00:16:19.299
No.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.932
Can you at least
tell me the truth?

00:16:21.933 --> 00:16:22.999
Am I gonna hurt someone?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.998
Yes.

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:25.264
Could I kill someone?

00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:25.848
Yes.

00:16:25.849 --> 00:16:27.148
Am I gonna kill someone?

00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:28.333
Probably.

00:16:34.533 --> 00:16:38.833
Look, I can show
you how to remember.

00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:42.858
I can show you how to control
the shift, even on a full moon.

00:16:43.614 --> 00:16:45.898
But it's not gonna
come for free.

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:47.499
What do you want?

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.066
You'll find out.

00:16:49.702 --> 00:16:51.700
But for now, I'm gonna
give you what you want.

00:16:51.701 --> 00:16:53.133
Go back to the bus.

00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:56.798
Go inside. See it,
feel it.

00:16:57.805 --> 00:16:59.220
Let your senses--
your sight,

00:16:59.221 --> 00:17:02.033
smell, touch--
let them remember for you.

00:17:02.738 --> 00:17:03.244
That's it?

00:17:03.245 --> 00:17:05.150
Just--just go back?

00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:07.532
Do you want to know
what happened?

00:17:07.533 --> 00:17:09.378
I just want to know if I hurt him.

00:17:09.617 --> 00:17:10.818
No, you don't.

00:17:12.129 --> 00:17:15.196
You want to know
if you'll hurt her.

00:17:29.232 --> 00:17:30.220
Hey, no, just me.

00:17:30.221 --> 00:17:31.346
Someone needs to keep watch.

00:17:31.907 --> 00:17:33.610
How come I'm always
the guy keeping  watch?

00:17:33.611 --> 00:17:35.128
Because there's
only two of us.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.590
Okay, why's it
starting to feel like

00:17:37.591 --> 00:17:38.910
you're Batman
and I'm Robin?

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.406
I don't want to be
Robin all the time.

00:17:41.757 --> 00:17:44.355
Nobody's Batman and Robin
any of the  time.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:45.989
Not even some of the time?

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.289
Just stay here.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.290
- Oh, my God!
- Fine.

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:13.799
Come on... come on...

00:20:14.985 --> 00:20:17.197
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:20:22.379 --> 00:20:23.308
Aah!

00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:24.845
Did it work?
Did you remember?

00:20:25.378 --> 00:20:27.000
Yeah, I was there last night.

00:20:27.001 --> 00:20:28.938
And the blood--
a lot of it was mine.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.906
So you did attack him?

00:20:29.907 --> 00:20:30.453
No.

00:20:30.454 --> 00:20:32.369
I saw glowing eyes in the bus,

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:33.416
but they weren't mine.

00:20:33.417 --> 00:20:34.122
It was Derek.

00:20:34.123 --> 00:20:35.302
What about the driver?

00:20:35.303 --> 00:20:37.104
I think I was actually
trying to protect him.

00:20:37.121 --> 00:20:40.322
Wait, why would Derek help you
remember that he attacked the driver?

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.174
That's what I don't get.

00:20:41.175 --> 00:20:42.815
It's got to be a pack thing.

00:20:42.847 --> 00:20:43.543
What do you mean?

00:20:43.544 --> 00:20:44.553
Like an initiation.

00:20:44.554 --> 00:20:45.812
You do the kill together.

00:20:45.813 --> 00:20:48.240
Because ripping someone's throat
out is a real bonding experience?

00:20:48.241 --> 00:20:49.394
Yeah, but you didn't do it,

00:20:49.395 --> 00:20:50.869
which means you're not a killer.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:51.931
And it also means that...

00:20:51.932 --> 00:20:53.537
I can go out with Allison.

00:20:54.578 --> 00:20:56.674
I was gonna say it means
you won't kill me.

00:20:56.944 --> 00:20:58.077
Oh, yeah.

00:20:58.735 --> 00:20:59.871
That too.

00:21:13.595 --> 00:21:15.461
Mmm, pass.

00:21:20.448 --> 00:21:21.397
Pass.

00:21:21.824 --> 00:21:22.763
Let me see.

00:21:24.177 --> 00:21:25.255
Pass.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.407
Pass.

00:21:29.602 --> 00:21:30.496
Uh, pass on all of it.

00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:35.356
Allison, respect for your taste
is, uh, dwindling by the second.

00:21:40.735 --> 00:21:41.748
This.

00:21:50.207 --> 00:21:51.345
Dad, hello?

00:21:52.668 --> 00:21:53.640
Right.

00:21:53.641 --> 00:21:54.253
I'm sorry.

00:21:54.254 --> 00:21:55.964
I completely forgot to knock.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.298
Hi, Mr. Argent.

00:21:59.544 --> 00:22:01.220
Dad, do you need something?

00:22:01.221 --> 00:22:03.004
I wanted to tell you that
you'll be staying in tonight.

00:22:03.005 --> 00:22:04.867
What? I'm going out with
my friends tonight.

00:22:04.878 --> 00:22:07.328
Not when some animal out
there is attacking people.

00:22:07.329 --> 00:22:08.932
Dad, dad, I'm--uh...

00:22:08.933 --> 00:22:09.520
It's out of my hands.

00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:10.089
There's a curfew.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.482
No one's allowed
out past 9:30 P.M.

00:22:13.403 --> 00:22:16.215
Hey, no more arguing.

00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:25.028
Someone's daddy's little girl.

00:22:27.002 --> 00:22:28.133
Sometimes.

00:22:29.218 --> 00:22:30.409
But not tonight.

00:22:48.675 --> 00:22:49.796
What are you doing?

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.781
Eight years gymnastics.

00:22:55.047 --> 00:22:56.149
Are you coming?

00:22:57.318 --> 00:22:58.744
I'll take the stairs.

00:23:07.168 --> 00:23:09.873
You look like you know
what you're doing.

00:23:10.234 --> 00:23:11.657
Used to bowl with my dad.

00:23:12.477 --> 00:23:13.911
When was the last
time you bowled?

00:23:14.781 --> 00:23:17.313
Uh, at a birthday party...

00:23:20.215 --> 00:23:21.539
When I was eight.

00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:42.892
I'm so bad at this.

00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.673
Somebody brought
their "A" game.

00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.307
Good job.

00:24:12.371 --> 00:24:13.332
Great.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.790
You're up, McCall.

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.316
You can do it, Scott.

00:24:49.427 --> 00:24:50.432
Jackson?

00:24:52.333 --> 00:24:53.509
Mind shutting up?

00:24:53.883 --> 00:24:55.368
I'm sorry.

00:24:55.395 --> 00:24:56.234
I'm sorry.

00:24:56.235 --> 00:24:58.999
I'm just flashing back to the
words "I'm a great bowler."

00:24:59.017 --> 00:25:01.715
Maybe he just needs
a little warm-up.

00:25:01.716 --> 00:25:04.060
Yeah, maybe he just needs
the kiddy bumpers.

00:25:05.988 --> 00:25:08.168
Just--just aim for the middle.

00:25:08.169 --> 00:25:10.352
How about you aim for anything
except for the gutter?

00:25:10.755 --> 00:25:12.140
Let him concentrate.

00:25:16.703 --> 00:25:19.859
Come on, just one pin, please.

00:25:36.627 --> 00:25:37.787
Great job, McCall.

00:25:37.907 --> 00:25:39.575
Man, you are a pro.

00:25:41.447 --> 00:25:42.350
Don't worry.

00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:43.620
We only just started.

00:26:27.025 --> 00:26:28.007
Scott.

00:26:28.315 --> 00:26:29.750
You're thinking too much.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:31.895
I know, I'm sorry.
I'm ruining this.

00:26:31.896 --> 00:26:36.195
No, no, not at all, but I
wouldn't mind shutting them up,

00:26:36.196 --> 00:26:40.316
so just clear your head and
think about something else.

00:26:41.485 --> 00:26:42.525
Like what?

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.931
Anything.

00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:46.251
Think about me.

00:26:48.214 --> 00:26:49.264
Naked.

00:27:20.004 --> 00:27:21.328
What did you say to him?

00:27:21.329 --> 00:27:24.299
Uh, I just gave him
something to think about.

00:27:41.223 --> 00:27:42.434
Nice ride.

00:27:43.617 --> 00:27:44.967
Black cars, though.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.495
Very hard to keep clean.

00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:52.600
I would definitely suggest
a little more maintenance.

00:27:55.223 --> 00:27:56.972
If you have something this nice,

00:27:57.425 --> 00:27:59.038
you want to take
care of it, right?

00:28:02.193 --> 00:28:07.371
Personally, I'm very protective
of the things I love.

00:28:07.904 --> 00:28:10.065
But that's something I
learned from my family.

00:28:12.187 --> 00:28:14.694
And you don't have much
of that these days.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.099
Do you?

00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:34.124
There we go.

00:28:35.897 --> 00:28:37.902
You can actually look through
your windshield now.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.781
See how that makes
everything so much clearer?

00:28:46.097 --> 00:28:47.515
You forgot to check the oil.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.491
Check the man's oil.

00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:05.036
Looks good to me.

00:29:05.802 --> 00:29:07.048
Drive safely.

00:29:28.295 --> 00:29:30.469
That is seriously amazing.

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:34.806
Jackson, uh, how many
strikes is that?

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.115
It's six.

00:29:37.691 --> 00:29:38.891
In a row.

00:29:39.868 --> 00:29:41.539
Something just clicked,
I guess.

00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:43.385
Maybe it's natural talent.

00:29:43.386 --> 00:29:45.248
I could use
some natural talent.

00:29:46.028 --> 00:29:47.858
You mind helping me
out this time, Scott?

00:29:49.463 --> 00:29:50.640
No, you're good.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:51.818
Go for it.

00:29:53.217 --> 00:29:55.229
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

00:29:57.685 --> 00:29:59.218
Hey, I'll help.

00:29:59.219 --> 00:30:01.189
How about I just try
this on my own?

00:30:19.154 --> 00:30:22.163
I think I'm getting
the hang of it.

00:30:22.347 --> 00:30:24.389
That was sort
of perfect form.

00:30:25.227 --> 00:30:26.260
Was it?

00:30:27.944 --> 00:30:31.357
Maybe you should stop pretending
to suck just for his benefit.

00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:35.358
Trust me, I do plenty of
sucking just for his benefit.

00:30:44.686 --> 00:30:45.905
Nice shot, man.

00:30:49.368 --> 00:30:53.605
Listen, I know we both
didn't want to be here.

00:30:54.262 --> 00:30:57.162
But the thing is, we don't
have to hate each other.

00:30:58.109 --> 00:30:59.280
I don't hate you.

00:30:59.864 --> 00:31:01.301
I just don't believe you.

00:31:01.446 --> 00:31:03.271
You know, you got everyone
thinking everything's fine and

00:31:03.272 --> 00:31:06.789
normal about you, but I
know something's off.

00:31:07.736 --> 00:31:09.134
You cheated tonight.

00:31:10.058 --> 00:31:11.742
How do you cheat in bowling?

00:31:11.818 --> 00:31:14.479
I don't know, but you did.

00:31:15.115 --> 00:31:18.673
And I don't know if it's
steroids or something weirder.

00:31:18.732 --> 00:31:20.318
I'm guessing
something weirder

00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:22.374
since it's pretty obvious
that you're a freak.

00:31:22.457 --> 00:31:24.588
So don't think for a second

00:31:24.589 --> 00:31:25.511
I've given up
on finding out

00:31:25.512 --> 00:31:27.084
what your little secret is.

00:31:28.725 --> 00:31:30.316
I don't have any secrets.

00:31:30.377 --> 00:31:31.484
Yeah, you do.

00:31:32.767 --> 00:31:34.709
And here's the other thing.

00:31:35.481 --> 00:31:38.569
I don't know why, but I think
whatever it is you're hiding,

00:31:40.354 --> 00:31:42.785
you don't want her to find
out about it, either.

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:53.798
Open your eyes.

00:31:59.133 --> 00:32:01.089
Open your eyes.

00:32:04.366 --> 00:32:05.472
Look at me.

00:32:13.213 --> 00:32:14.566
What do you remember?

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:18.068
Hale.

00:32:20.518 --> 00:32:21.770
How do you know my name?

00:32:23.732 --> 00:32:24.901
I'm sorry.

00:32:25.482 --> 00:32:26.766
How do you know me?

00:32:27.875 --> 00:32:29.058
I'm sorry.

00:32:42.987 --> 00:32:44.517
Girl, I am outta here.

00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:48.861
There's a DVR at home full of
unwatched TV waiting to remind me

00:32:48.862 --> 00:32:51.814
how ridiculously
single I really am.

00:32:55.997 --> 00:32:58.545
Rose, call a Code, Room 137.

00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:22.827
So, uh, do you think we
could hang out again soon?

00:33:23.916 --> 00:33:25.021
Definitely.

00:33:25.096 --> 00:33:27.738
But I have to admit something.

00:33:30.015 --> 00:33:31.723
Um, I'm not big on group dates.

00:33:31.724 --> 00:33:34.980
So next time,
just the two of us.

00:33:35.112 --> 00:33:37.354
I could totally
handle more of that.

00:33:38.089 --> 00:33:39.156
Great.

00:33:42.137 --> 00:33:43.134
Allison?

00:34:04.804 --> 00:34:06.726
I'd like a little
more of that...

00:34:27.066 --> 00:34:27.911
Hey, Scott,

00:34:27.912 --> 00:34:31.601
I'm gonna go to... sleep.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.036
Seriously.

00:34:50.326 --> 00:34:52.606
Stiles, what the hell
are you doing here?

00:34:52.607 --> 00:34:53.907
What am I doing?

00:34:54.112 --> 00:34:56.078
God, do either of you
even play baseball?

00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:57.116
What?

00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:00.924
Can you please tell your
friend to use the front door?

00:35:01.184 --> 00:35:01.913
But we lock the front door.

00:35:01.914 --> 00:35:03.189
He wouldn't be able to get in.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:35:04.956 --> 00:35:06.765
And, by the way,
do either of you care  that

00:35:06.766 --> 00:35:08.765
there's a police-enforced curfew?

00:35:08.822 --> 00:35:09.438
No.

00:35:09.439 --> 00:35:10.711
No. All right then.

00:35:10.712 --> 00:35:12.060
Well, you know what?

00:35:12.228 --> 00:35:13.790
That's about enough parenting
for me for one night,

00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:16.039
so good night.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:21.818
What?

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.423
My dad left for the
hospital 15 minutes ago.

00:35:25.424 --> 00:35:26.850
It's the bus driver.

00:35:28.909 --> 00:35:31.046
They said he succumbed
to his wounds.

00:35:31.746 --> 00:35:32.884
Succumbed?

00:35:33.207 --> 00:35:35.672
Scott, he's dead.

00:35:46.574 --> 00:35:47.575
Derek!

00:35:47.662 --> 00:35:48.804
I know you're here!

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.553
I know what you did!

00:35:53.805 --> 00:35:56.361
I didn't do anything.

00:35:59.145 --> 00:36:00.336
You killed him!

00:36:00.399 --> 00:36:02.077
He died.

00:36:04.508 --> 00:36:05.809
Like your sister died?

00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:08.211
My sister was missing.

00:36:08.695 --> 00:36:10.451
I came here looking for her.

00:36:12.513 --> 00:36:13.015
You found her.

00:36:13.016 --> 00:36:14.845
I found her in pieces,

00:36:15.215 --> 00:36:17.460
being used as bait
to catch me.

00:36:18.718 --> 00:36:20.425
I think you killed
them both.

00:36:21.889 --> 00:36:23.387
I'm gonna tell everyone,

00:36:24.084 --> 00:36:25.619
starting with the sheriff.

00:37:06.328 --> 00:37:07.307
That was cute.

00:38:52.189 --> 00:38:53.411
I didn't kill him.

00:38:54.226 --> 00:38:55.457
Neither of us did.

00:38:56.106 --> 00:38:58.005
It's not your fault,
and it's not mine.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:59.775
This?

00:39:00.423 --> 00:39:01.950
This is all your fault!

00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:03.639
You ruined my life!

00:39:04.507 --> 00:39:06.333
No, I didn't.

00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:08.066
You're the one
who bit me.

00:39:08.067 --> 00:39:09.860
No, I'm not.

00:39:11.383 --> 00:39:12.408
What?

00:39:12.412 --> 00:39:14.097
I'm not the one
that bit you.

00:39:40.708 --> 00:39:41.900
There's another.

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:43.594
It's called an Alpha.

00:39:43.895 --> 00:39:45.472
It's the most
dangerous of our kind.

00:39:46.442 --> 00:39:48.017
You and I, we're betas.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.015
This thing is more powerful,

00:39:52.531 --> 00:39:54.493
more animal than
either of us.

00:39:55.696 --> 00:39:57.253
My sister came here
looking for him.

00:39:57.254 --> 00:39:58.917
Now I'm trying to find him.

00:39:59.243 --> 00:40:01.201
But I don't think
I can do it without you.

00:40:04.172 --> 00:40:05.261
Why me?

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.255
Because he's the one
that bit you.

00:40:08.181 --> 00:40:09.841
You're part of his pack.

00:40:13.141 --> 00:40:14.314
It's you, Scott.

00:40:17.744 --> 00:40:18.971
You're the one he wants.

00:40:36.004 --> 00:40:46.971
