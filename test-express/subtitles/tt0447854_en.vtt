WEBVTT

00:00:44.332 --> 00:00:46.292
Mother!

00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:50.713
Mother!

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.092
Moth...

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:58.512
Your mother
can't be with you anymore.

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:01.556
Come.

00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:39.633
- Friend Owl.
- Excuse me, sir.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:42.219
I hope I'm not intruding, but...

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.221
well, I... I just had to come.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.392
Poor little fellow.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:52.478
So young to be without his mother.

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.899
Well, if I can be of any help...

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:01.028
Wait.

00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:03.822
I could use your help.

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:07.200
Find me a suitable doe to raise Bambi.

00:02:07.283 --> 00:02:11.287
Oh, oh, yes.
Of course, yes.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.873
Food's so scarce.

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:17.334
Does can barely feed themselves.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.879
Perhaps you could...

00:02:20.963 --> 00:02:25.633
Me? You know as well as I do,
a prince looks after the herd.

00:02:25.675 --> 00:02:27.469
Does care for the young.

00:02:27.552 --> 00:02:33.140
But you are his father,
and circumstances being what they are...

00:02:39.354 --> 00:02:42.149
- Until spring.
- Oh, excellent.

00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:45.985
After all, who better
to raise the young prince

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:48.863
than the great prince himself?

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:31.819
* Under the snow.
beneath the frozen streams

00:03:31.903 --> 00:03:37.074
* There is life

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:39.201
* You ha vo to kno w

00:03:39.284 --> 00:03:41.578
* When nature sleeps. she dreams

00:03:41.662 --> 00:03:46.082
* There is life

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:51.254
* And the colder the winter.
the warmer the spring

00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:56.133
* The deeper the sorrow.
the more our hearts sing

00:03:56.217 --> 00:03:58.677
* Even when you can"t see it

00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:04.057
* vnsvde ovorythvng

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.937
* There is life

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.912
* After the rain.
the sun will reappear

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:32.333
* There is life

00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:37.171
* After the pain.
the joy will still be here

00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:41.800
* There is life

00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:47.180
* For it"s out of the darkness
that we learn to see

00:04:47.222 --> 00:04:51.809
* And out of the silence
that songs come to be

00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:58.732
* And all that we dream of
awaits patiently

00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:04.738
* There is life

00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:14.622
* There is life

00:05:46.317 --> 00:05:47.986
Ahem.

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.405
Uh...

00:05:50.446 --> 00:05:52.114
Good morning.

00:05:52.198 --> 00:05:56.118
Bambi, a prince awakens
before the forest does.

00:05:56.202 --> 00:06:00.622
If you're late again, I'll have no choice...

00:06:00.706 --> 00:06:02.958
What was that?

00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.794
What was what?

00:06:06.753 --> 00:06:09.339
I- I guess it was my stomach.

00:06:09.422 --> 00:06:11.799
Then you should eat.

00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:16.303
Oh, well...

00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:20.641
I suppose I should
find you something to eat.

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:27.480
Here.

00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:32.777
Urgh. No, thank you.

00:06:32.818 --> 00:06:36.030
- Have you ever tried it?
- Well, no.

00:06:36.113 --> 00:06:41.993
Then how do you know
you don't like it if you've never tried it?

00:06:43.954 --> 00:06:45.455
Hm?

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:48.374
Mm! Mm-hm!

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:50.585
Urgh!

00:06:50.668 --> 00:06:54.755
Come along. We have to check
on the other deer in the South Wood.

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.800
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
- Bam...

00:06:57.883 --> 00:06:59.426
Bambi!

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.555
A prince does not whoo-hoo.

00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:06.558
- He doesn't?
- He certainly does not.

00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:09.811
A prince maintains control at all times.

00:07:09.894 --> 00:07:13.522
Display dignity.
Walk with pride.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.865
Argh! Who-o-o-a!

00:07:24.532 --> 00:07:26.367
I'm OK!

00:07:30.997 --> 00:07:33.833
Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!

00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:36.377
Ooh! Ooh!
Agh! Agh! Agh!

00:07:36.418 --> 00:07:39.004
Oh! Oh!
Cold! Cold!

00:07:50.556 --> 00:07:53.934
One, two...

00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:55.603
two...

00:07:55.853 --> 00:07:58.022
two...

00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:04.402
Argh!

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.800
Whoa!

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:33.512
Don't you think it'd be better
if we got a little closer?

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:36.599
The distance
makes it easier to spot danger.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.809
Hm.

00:08:38.892 --> 00:08:42.437
But it sure makes it
harder to play with them.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.858
Play is a healthy part
of a young deer's development.

00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:50.194
- Is that so?
- Mm-hm. Mother says so.

00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:53.864
- One time, Mother and I were out...
- Bambi.

00:08:53.948 --> 00:08:57.409
- A fawn came over and wanted to play...
- Bambi.

00:08:59.453 --> 00:09:04.124
I think it's best
to leave the past in the past.

00:09:04.207 --> 00:09:07.836
A prince does not look back,
only ahead.

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:10.129
Oh. Yes, sir.

00:09:10.213 --> 00:09:13.966
Now, come.
We still have a lot of ground to cover today.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.885
Don't fall behind.

00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:53.836
Thumper!

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:57.715
Bambi!
Boy, am I glad to see you.

00:09:57.756 --> 00:09:58.799
What's wrong?

00:09:58.882 --> 00:10:01.385
They've been after me all morning.

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:04.554
- Who has?
- Oh, big brother!

00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:06.556
It's them!

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:15.773
- Hello, Young Prince.
- Hello, Young Prince.

00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:19.776
- Oh. Hello.
- Have you seen Thumper around?

00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:22.737
Uh-uh.

00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:26.366
I think he's over there.
Look, look.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.120
Oh, OK.

00:10:31.204 --> 00:10:33.789
I guess we will be leaving, then.

00:10:39.461 --> 00:10:42.130
- Gotcha!
- Argh!

00:10:42.214 --> 00:10:45.383
Mama says you're gonna
take us to see the groundhog.

00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:47.302
What she says goes.

00:10:47.343 --> 00:10:49.637
Well, she's not the boss of me.

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:53.307
If I don't want to, Mama can't make me.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.860
- Hi, Mama.
- What did your father tell you?

00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:10.156
- 'Bout what?
- About playing with your sisters.

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:13.159
Oh, that one.

00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:18.038
A family that plays together... um...

00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:21.750
stays together...

00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:27.005
even if it means
taking your dumb sisters.

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:30.091
Bambi!

00:11:31.384 --> 00:11:34.011
Coming!
I gotta go.

00:11:34.053 --> 00:11:38.390
But you can't go.
You can't leave me with the girls.

00:11:38.432 --> 00:11:42.436
Come on, Thumper.
You gotta take us to see the groundhog.

00:11:45.063 --> 00:11:46.898
Ahem.

00:12:09.836 --> 00:12:13.214
Why don't you go with your friends
to see the groundhog?

00:12:13.297 --> 00:12:15.216
But I want to stay with you.

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:17.426
Yes, well...

00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:21.805
I have to check
on the South Meadow and it's very far.

00:12:21.847 --> 00:12:25.475
You go see the groundhog.
I'll meet you there later.

00:12:25.558 --> 00:12:28.019
Oh. OK.

00:12:28.102 --> 00:12:30.188
I'll meet ya.

00:12:32.565 --> 00:12:34.817
Hey, Thumper, wait for me!

00:12:41.365 --> 00:12:43.241
- You sit by me!
- No, no!

00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:46.286
Quiet! Um...

00:12:46.327 --> 00:12:48.121
First one there's who I sit by.

00:12:48.204 --> 00:12:51.666
- Hooray! It's gonna be me!
- Uh-uh, it's gonna be me!

00:12:51.707 --> 00:12:55.669
Sheesh! I'm sure glad
your father let you come.

00:12:55.753 --> 00:12:58.547
Oh. He understands.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.341
He-he and I are best pals.

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:16.313
Wake up, Flower.
Wake up.

00:13:24.446 --> 00:13:28.449
Come on, Flower.
You're gonna miss the groundhog.

00:13:28.533 --> 00:13:32.536
Gosh, I hope
the groundhog sees his shadow...

00:13:33.621 --> 00:13:37.791
so I can get back to hibernating.

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:40.335
Attention, everyone. Attention.

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:43.630
Everybody, gather round.

00:13:43.713 --> 00:13:46.674
We'll be starting
in just a few moments, yes.

00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:48.885
Now, there's plenty of room.

00:13:48.926 --> 00:13:53.222
Ma'am, could you just scoot over one?

00:13:53.306 --> 00:13:55.474
Very nice.

00:13:58.352 --> 00:14:02.355
Oh, Young Prince.
This is a special occasion.

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:05.150
We decided we'll all sit by you.

00:14:06.234 --> 00:14:08.861
Greetings, greetings.

00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:10.863
Each year we gather round

00:14:10.947 --> 00:14:15.951
to watch the groundhog
emerge from his winter slumber,

00:14:16.035 --> 00:14:18.537
for if he sees his shadow...

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.081
...it means more winter!

00:14:21.123 --> 00:14:24.251
Yes.
But if he doesn't...

00:14:24.292 --> 00:14:26.586
Spring is on its way!

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.921
Yes.

00:14:29.005 --> 00:14:33.634
Now, without any further interruptions...

00:14:34.468 --> 00:14:36.595
the groundhog!

00:14:39.264 --> 00:14:41.266
The groundhog!

00:14:49.524 --> 00:14:51.609
Where's the groundhog?

00:14:51.651 --> 00:14:55.779
Groundhog! Groundhog!
Groundhog! Groundhog! Groundhog!

00:14:55.863 --> 00:14:58.240
Now, what seems to be the problem?

00:14:58.323 --> 00:15:01.952
I'm afraid to go out there.
I'll see my shadow.

00:15:01.993 --> 00:15:04.454
Well, that's entirely the point, isn't it?

00:15:04.496 --> 00:15:06.623
- I don't care.
- Oh.

00:15:06.664 --> 00:15:09.751
Must we go through this every year?

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:21.678
Hello, Bambi.

00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:27.267
Hi, Faline.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.728
- I almost didn't recognize you.
- Really?

00:15:30.812 --> 00:15:34.190
I- I guess it's 'cause
my spots are almost gone.

00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:37.443
And my antlers are coming in too.
Can you see 'em?

00:15:37.526 --> 00:15:39.361
Um, well...

00:15:39.403 --> 00:15:42.030
I don't see anything.

00:15:43.114 --> 00:15:45.450
Well, I don't.

00:15:48.911 --> 00:15:51.038
Whoa!

00:15:51.122 --> 00:15:52.582
Oh, well, yes.

00:15:52.665 --> 00:15:55.251
The groundhog!

00:15:55.334 --> 00:15:58.712
Oh, why me?
Oh, this is the last year.

00:15:58.754 --> 00:16:01.631
My nerves just can't take it anymore.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.302
- I see his shadow.
- More winter.

00:16:06.386 --> 00:16:09.514
More hibernating.

00:16:09.597 --> 00:16:13.017
No shadow, no shadow.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.855
Please, no shadow.
Please don't let there be a shadow.

00:16:17.938 --> 00:16:20.691
Please don't let there be a shadow.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.653
No shadow.
No shadow.

00:16:24.736 --> 00:16:28.489
Oh, spring is here!
Spring is here!

00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:36.372
* Oh, let's sing a gay little spring song,
let's get together and sing

00:16:36.455 --> 00:16:38.832
* Fa la la, roll de ay,
twit twit awee

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:41.001
Oh, that song.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:44.170
Oh, I'll never be frightened again.

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.256
- Boo!
- Argh!

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:50.843
Oh.

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:52.887
Ah.

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:59.768
It looks like
I scared the shadow right out of him.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.604
Did you see the look on his...

00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:05.690
Hey!

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:08.901
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

00:17:10.445 --> 00:17:13.948
Where's everybody going?
Forest on fire?

00:17:15.699 --> 00:17:17.493
Who are you?

00:17:17.576 --> 00:17:22.539
Name's Ronno,
and these are the boys - Stab and Jab.

00:17:23.623 --> 00:17:26.626
Well, I hope the three of you
have a nice day.

00:17:26.709 --> 00:17:30.171
I wouldn't go that way if I were you.

00:17:30.254 --> 00:17:32.923
That's where I saw a man.

00:17:33.007 --> 00:17:35.509
You saw a man?

00:17:35.593 --> 00:17:37.344
Uh-huh.

00:17:37.428 --> 00:17:40.806
There I was, out in the meadow.

00:17:40.889 --> 00:17:45.143
Suddenly I heard this voice
luring me in.

00:17:45.226 --> 00:17:48.980
"I'm here, I'm here. "

00:17:49.522 --> 00:17:55.194
See, man's got this stick that can
make his voice sound like one of us.

00:17:55.277 --> 00:17:58.030
But I'm way too smart for that,

00:17:58.113 --> 00:18:00.782
so I crept up on him...

00:18:00.866 --> 00:18:03.034
real quiet.

00:18:05.578 --> 00:18:09.791
Then bam!
I knocked him out with my trusty antlers.

00:18:13.127 --> 00:18:15.421
That's quite a story.

00:18:15.504 --> 00:18:17.881
- Oh, you think so?
- Mm-hm.

00:18:17.923 --> 00:18:19.883
It's... unbelievable.

00:18:19.925 --> 00:18:23.386
Yeah. Unbelievable.

00:18:23.428 --> 00:18:25.555
- You calling me a liar?
- No.

00:18:25.597 --> 00:18:28.349
- You wanna spar, do ya?
- No!

00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:30.560
Clobber him, Bambi.

00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:33.688
Bambi?
Isn't that a girl's name?

00:18:35.105 --> 00:18:37.149
Come on. Let's go.

00:18:37.232 --> 00:18:40.986
Just a little, friendly competition.

00:18:41.069 --> 00:18:43.196
Ronno!

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.617
- Coming, Mother.
- Yeah. Maybe you should get going.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.245
Jeez, I was only
playing around with him.

00:18:51.329 --> 00:18:53.331
Isn't that right, Bambi?

00:18:53.414 --> 00:18:56.125
- Ronno!
- I'm coming!

00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:58.961
Ma! How many times
do I have to tell you?

00:18:59.044 --> 00:19:01.838
Don't bother me
when I'm trying to make new friends.

00:19:01.922 --> 00:19:03.507
Sorry, dear.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.467
You big mama's boy!

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.804
Why don't you run home to your mama?
You big old mama's boy!

00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:11.764
Thumper!

00:19:11.847 --> 00:19:13.432
Coming, Mama.

00:19:13.516 --> 00:19:15.559
Gotta go.
See you, Bambi.

00:19:15.643 --> 00:19:18.979
So tell me,
what did the groundhog see?

00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:21.356
See you, Bambi.

00:19:22.566 --> 00:19:27.862
- Do you want us to walk you home?
- No. My father's coming for me.

00:19:27.946 --> 00:19:31.866
Well, it was nice
to see you again, Bambi.

00:20:45.016 --> 00:20:46.976
Bambi.

00:20:52.773 --> 00:20:54.608
Mother?

00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:09.288
I miss you so much.

00:21:09.372 --> 00:21:11.707
Shh. There, there.

00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:15.419
It's going to be all right.
You'll see.

00:21:15.503 --> 00:21:18.505
Why did you have to go?

00:21:18.589 --> 00:21:21.800
Everything in the forest has its season.

00:21:21.883 --> 00:21:25.845
Where one thing falls, another grows.

00:21:25.887 --> 00:21:28.014
Maybe not what was there before,

00:21:28.097 --> 00:21:32.310
but something new and wonderful,
all the same.

00:21:32.393 --> 00:21:34.353
But I feel so alone.

00:21:34.395 --> 00:21:36.188
I'm always with you.

00:21:36.272 --> 00:21:40.317
Even when you can't see me,
I'm here.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.235
I'm here.

00:21:42.486 --> 00:21:44.529
I'm here.

00:21:45.613 --> 00:21:47.782
I"m here.

00:21:50.118 --> 00:21:52.536
Hello.

00:21:54.163 --> 00:21:56.165
Hello?

00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:59.042
I"m here.

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:02.796
Mother?

00:22:02.879 --> 00:22:04.923
It"s me.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.676
I"m here.

00:22:11.387 --> 00:22:13.556
Hello.

00:22:16.058 --> 00:22:18.560
I"m here.

00:22:18.644 --> 00:22:21.063
Wait!
I'm coming.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.325
Hello?

00:22:39.163 --> 00:22:41.665
Hello.

00:22:42.749 --> 00:22:45.460
I"m here.

00:22:45.543 --> 00:22:47.754
It"s me.

00:22:48.963 --> 00:22:52.008
- Mother?
- I"m here.

00:22:53.092 --> 00:22:55.636
Hello.

00:22:55.886 --> 00:22:58.097
Hello.

00:22:58.138 --> 00:23:00.224
I"m here.

00:23:20.784 --> 00:23:22.035
Bambi!

00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:33.796
Run, Bambi!

00:23:53.981 --> 00:23:55.816
Run, Bambi!

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.651
Go! Now!

00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:16.252
But it was Mother.
I heard her voice.

00:24:16.335 --> 00:24:19.922
- It was one of man's tricks.
- I'm sorry.

00:24:20.005 --> 00:24:23.967
What if I hadn't gotten there in time?
You could have been...

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:29.430
When I tell you to run, you run.
Never freeze like that, ever!

00:24:29.514 --> 00:24:32.725
I'm... I'm sorry.

00:24:40.065 --> 00:24:42.317
Let's go home.

00:25:04.462 --> 00:25:07.966
She's never coming back, is she?

00:25:14.305 --> 00:25:16.140
No.

00:25:54.216 --> 00:25:57.219
- Friend Owl.
- Hm?

00:25:57.302 --> 00:25:59.721
Winter is coming to an end.

00:25:59.805 --> 00:26:05.560
You should have little trouble
finding a new home for Bambi.

00:26:13.025 --> 00:26:15.319
Big brother!

00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:18.864
Oh, big brother!

00:26:20.949 --> 00:26:23.118
Big brother!

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.625
Every time we turn our backs he's gone.

00:26:30.708 --> 00:26:35.087
Search everywhere.
Leave no stone unturned.

00:26:41.009 --> 00:26:43.762
How come
we're hiding from your sisters?

00:26:43.845 --> 00:26:45.055
Shh!

00:26:45.096 --> 00:26:49.726
- I think they're sweet.
- Well, you don't have to live with them.

00:26:52.853 --> 00:26:54.814
Back up.

00:26:54.897 --> 00:26:57.441
Watch it!

00:26:58.358 --> 00:27:00.360
Come on! Push harder!

00:27:00.444 --> 00:27:02.904
Agh!

00:27:02.946 --> 00:27:04.948
Sheesh.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.367
So, where are we off to today?

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:10.286
You're going to stay near the den
where it's safe.

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:14.373
But I'm ready for danger,
for adventure, for... for...

00:27:14.457 --> 00:27:16.166
The den.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.544
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

00:27:18.627 --> 00:27:20.837
I'll stay and guard the den.

00:27:33.182 --> 00:27:34.975
Hey, Bambi.

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:37.686
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.314
Come on.
You can tell your bestest friend.

00:27:41.356 --> 00:27:46.444
Well... my father
never takes me with him anymore.

00:27:46.528 --> 00:27:51.115
I guess I'm not
what a prince's son is supposed to be.

00:27:51.199 --> 00:27:54.618
- If I could just show him.
- Show him what?

00:27:54.702 --> 00:27:57.454
That I can be brave like him.

00:27:59.957 --> 00:28:04.169
If that's all it is, being brave is easy.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.588
- I can teach you.
- You can?

00:28:06.671 --> 00:28:10.174
Sure. Watch this.

00:28:10.216 --> 00:28:12.134
Aaar!

00:28:12.885 --> 00:28:15.054
I think he's got a hairball.

00:28:15.137 --> 00:28:18.599
No, I'm being brave, silly.

00:28:18.682 --> 00:28:23.311
The trick is to be scarier
than whatever's scaring you. See?

00:28:23.395 --> 00:28:24.980
Grrr!

00:28:25.855 --> 00:28:27.482
Grrr!

00:28:28.816 --> 00:28:30.776
You look like a squirrel.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.862
Oh, oh, watch me, watch me!

00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:34.947
Grrr!

00:28:37.032 --> 00:28:39.701
E- e-ew, Flower!

00:28:39.743 --> 00:28:42.579
You just found your inner strength.

00:28:42.621 --> 00:28:45.582
Oh, gosh!

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:48.376
OK. Now, stand very straight.

00:28:48.418 --> 00:28:50.294
Stick out your chest.

00:28:50.378 --> 00:28:56.383
Take the deepest breath
you ever took in your whole life.

00:28:57.593 --> 00:29:00.804
Now let it out with a big grrr.

00:29:01.304 --> 00:29:03.640
Baa!

00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:08.061
You're gonna need a lot of practice.

00:29:08.144 --> 00:29:12.231
Come on. Do what I do.
I'm a mountain lion. Raargh!

00:29:12.315 --> 00:29:13.691
Oh. Oh!

00:29:13.774 --> 00:29:15.985
I'm a... a bear.

00:29:16.068 --> 00:29:18.153
Baa!

00:29:18.237 --> 00:29:20.864
I'm a turtle. Grrr.

00:29:22.908 --> 00:29:27.704
What? Turtles are so scary.

00:29:31.749 --> 00:29:33.834
Come on.
You can do it.

00:29:33.918 --> 00:29:35.961
- Raargh!
- Baa!

00:29:36.045 --> 00:29:39.798
Come on, now.
Watch this. Raargh!

00:29:39.882 --> 00:29:41.633
- Grrr!
- Baa!

00:29:41.675 --> 00:29:45.387
Yeah, that's it.
Come on. Try it again.

00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:48.097
Baa!

00:29:48.181 --> 00:29:50.016
Yeah. That was good.

00:29:51.434 --> 00:29:52.560
Grrr!

00:29:52.643 --> 00:29:55.521
- Baa!
- Grrr!

00:29:55.604 --> 00:29:58.899
- Come on, come on!
- Baa!

00:29:58.982 --> 00:30:00.317
Argh!

00:30:01.193 --> 00:30:03.570
- Grrr!
- Raargh!

00:30:03.653 --> 00:30:05.989
Baa!

00:30:06.364 --> 00:30:09.659
Aaar!

00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:12.370
Baa!

00:30:12.453 --> 00:30:14.622
Yeah, that's it.

00:30:14.705 --> 00:30:17.416
Grrr!

00:30:17.499 --> 00:30:19.751
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:30:24.214 --> 00:30:27.091
- Baa!
- Grrr!

00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:29.010
Aaar!

00:30:32.221 --> 00:30:34.056
Grrr!

00:30:37.226 --> 00:30:39.895
Raargh!

00:30:42.355 --> 00:30:47.068
Watch this. Raargh!

00:30:49.237 --> 00:30:54.408
See? There's nothing to it.
All it takes is one good grrr.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.327
Grrr!

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.287
Porky pine!

00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:02.833
Get out and stay out,
you trespassing hooligans.

00:31:02.916 --> 00:31:06.878
Trashy, muddy paws.
Couldn't you have anything nice?

00:31:08.212 --> 00:31:11.132
Well, we can always swim across.

00:31:11.174 --> 00:31:13.175
Uh-oh.

00:31:14.593 --> 00:31:17.054
Let's go before he sees you.

00:31:17.137 --> 00:31:19.598
No. This is it.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.434
I can show my dad how brave I am.

00:31:23.226 --> 00:31:26.146
You better hurry.

00:31:30.108 --> 00:31:33.611
Don't worry.
I'll take care of your dad.

00:31:37.031 --> 00:31:40.617
And remember what I taught you.
Grrr!

00:31:49.459 --> 00:31:53.337
I'm gonna walk across this log.
Baa!

00:31:54.004 --> 00:31:56.840
Get off my property, you pesky squirrel.

00:31:56.882 --> 00:32:00.302
I- I'm not a squirrel.
I'm the young prince.

00:32:00.344 --> 00:32:03.096
Ha! Where you going, Princey?

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.181
Not this way.
Try again.

00:32:07.267 --> 00:32:10.561
Help! Help!

00:32:10.645 --> 00:32:13.564
There's this thing,
and it's got these eyes,

00:32:13.647 --> 00:32:16.150
and these claws like... grrr!

00:32:16.233 --> 00:32:19.695
And it walks around like this.
Hai, hai, hai.

00:32:19.778 --> 00:32:22.114
And, well, you gotta see it.

00:32:24.324 --> 00:32:27.118
Well, come on!

00:32:29.412 --> 00:32:32.039
Ha! Try again!
Try again! Try again!

00:32:32.081 --> 00:32:34.875
You don't understand.
I have to get across.

00:32:34.917 --> 00:32:40.172
Go around. In my day, we didn't wander
willy-nilly onto someone's property.

00:32:40.255 --> 00:32:41.882
We took the long way.

00:32:41.923 --> 00:32:45.927
It sometimes took days,
weeks, in the pouring rain,

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:50.056
'cause we had
a little thing called respect.

00:32:52.308 --> 00:32:54.060
Bambi, you did it!

00:32:54.101 --> 00:32:56.604
Yeah?
Oh, you did it all right.

00:32:59.106 --> 00:33:02.150
Behind you! Look out!

00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:05.236
Again!

00:33:07.363 --> 00:33:09.115
Come again!

00:33:09.198 --> 00:33:11.492
Hurry up!
It's right over here.

00:33:13.327 --> 00:33:15.454
Oops. Wrong way.
Nothing here.

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:19.249
Whoa!

00:33:24.754 --> 00:33:27.257
Whoa!

00:33:30.968 --> 00:33:34.263
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything. Probably a bird.

00:33:34.305 --> 00:33:37.433
Yeah, that's it.
A bird. Ow!

00:33:37.516 --> 00:33:39.434
Oh, no.

00:33:39.476 --> 00:33:41.603
Ha! That'll teach you.

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:47.108
Think twice before you trespass round here
again. Mind your own beeswax next time.

00:33:50.403 --> 00:33:53.197
Grrr, grrr, grrr.

00:33:54.281 --> 00:33:58.744
That's the problem with these kids today.
No respect. No respect at all.

00:33:58.827 --> 00:34:01.747
What are you looking at,
you big moose?

00:34:03.498 --> 00:34:04.791
Ahem.

00:34:24.142 --> 00:34:27.478
Bambi, are you OK?

00:34:27.562 --> 00:34:30.231
How does it look?

00:34:30.314 --> 00:34:32.024
Ew!

00:34:32.108 --> 00:34:36.070
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It ain't pretty.

00:34:36.153 --> 00:34:38.655
It's hopeless.
I'm a coward.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:41.283
- No. You're brave.
- Ow!

00:34:41.366 --> 00:34:46.079
- No one's ever got that far across before.
- Ow!

00:34:46.162 --> 00:34:49.749
That's the great thing about me.
I don't feel any pain.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.960
Watch this.

00:34:53.044 --> 00:34:56.046
Argh! Oh!

00:34:56.088 --> 00:34:58.632
See? Nothing.

00:34:58.715 --> 00:35:00.259
Ow!

00:35:00.342 --> 00:35:01.385
What was that?

00:35:01.468 --> 00:35:05.764
Ah, probably just some poor, dumb animal
caught in a trap. So anyways...

00:35:05.805 --> 00:35:08.141
- Ow!
- Bambi!

00:35:08.725 --> 00:35:12.103
Hey!
I wasn't finished talking about me.

00:35:13.187 --> 00:35:16.815
- Just one more.
- Bambi, what happened?

00:35:16.899 --> 00:35:19.276
Bambi got stuck by a porky pine.

00:35:19.318 --> 00:35:22.154
- A porcupine? Where?
- Hold still!

00:35:22.237 --> 00:35:23.905
- It was nothing.
- Are you hurt?

00:35:23.989 --> 00:35:27.116
- Stop moving!
- I'm fine. Really. It's just...

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.035
Ow!

00:35:29.118 --> 00:35:30.495
Got it.

00:35:30.578 --> 00:35:36.250
Bambi. I thought I recognized that scream.
I'm surprised to see you moving.

00:35:36.292 --> 00:35:39.878
- It was only a porcupine.
- No, no, no.

00:35:39.962 --> 00:35:42.923
I'm talking about
how you froze out on the meadow,

00:35:43.006 --> 00:35:45.884
and right in front of your father.

00:35:45.967 --> 00:35:48.886
- Ronno!
- Don't feel bad.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:53.682
If we didn't have cowards, we couldn't
tell who the brave ones are. Hm.

00:35:54.141 --> 00:35:57.311
I'm not a coward.
Baa!

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.315
Oh, uh, yeah, sure, sure.
Come on. Let's go.

00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:05.276
- I'm staying here.
- Ah, come on.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.489
- Ronno, quit it.
- Leave her alone.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:13.451
Did you say something, Bambi?

00:36:13.534 --> 00:36:15.161
No. Uh, well...

00:36:15.244 --> 00:36:17.371
I mean, yes.

00:36:18.455 --> 00:36:21.792
Leave her alone. Please?

00:36:21.875 --> 00:36:23.501
You tell him, Bambi.

00:36:23.543 --> 00:36:28.506
Oh, wook. It's the wittle bunny
and the wittle skunk.

00:36:28.548 --> 00:36:33.386
Does the young prince play
with the wittle bunny and the wittle skunk?

00:36:36.889 --> 00:36:37.890
Grrr!

00:36:37.973 --> 00:36:40.142
Run!

00:36:42.769 --> 00:36:45.063
Run, Bambi!

00:36:55.698 --> 00:36:56.699
Aarrgh!

00:36:59.952 --> 00:37:01.870
Whoa!

00:37:01.912 --> 00:37:04.748
Other way! Other way!

00:37:05.206 --> 00:37:07.750
Turn around! Turn around!

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:14.131
Aaaarrrgh!

00:37:18.969 --> 00:37:21.263
We made it.

00:37:24.057 --> 00:37:25.934
What's the matter?

00:37:25.975 --> 00:37:28.436
Too scared? Uh-huh.

00:37:28.519 --> 00:37:31.689
Look at him.
Look at him shaking.

00:37:31.772 --> 00:37:35.526
Now who's the baby,
you big baby?

00:37:35.609 --> 00:37:38.070
- Whoa!
- Um...

00:37:38.987 --> 00:37:40.155
Hello.

00:37:40.238 --> 00:37:42.032
I told you to stay near the den.

00:37:42.115 --> 00:37:46.119
When I give you an order,
I expect you to...

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:48.955
How did you...

00:37:50.456 --> 00:37:52.416
Did you jump?

00:37:53.501 --> 00:37:56.003
- Yes, sir.
- Hm.

00:37:56.086 --> 00:38:00.799
I didn't make a jump like that
until I had antlers.

00:38:09.682 --> 00:38:11.934
Yes. Well...

00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:15.896
We should be going...

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.523
um...

00:38:17.606 --> 00:38:19.691
home.

00:38:19.775 --> 00:38:22.944
He's never said
anything nice like that before.

00:38:23.028 --> 00:38:25.697
I guess he saw how brave you were.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:29.659
Gosh, what a jump.
It was like flying.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.913
What's the big deal?
Anyone can make that jump.

00:38:34.997 --> 00:38:37.082
Aaaargh!

00:38:37.166 --> 00:38:38.792
A- a-aarrgh!

00:38:52.054 --> 00:38:55.641
Come on.
You jumped further than this yesterday.

00:38:55.724 --> 00:38:58.393
I... don't know.

00:38:58.435 --> 00:39:02.230
You're not afraid, are you?

00:39:02.272 --> 00:39:05.567
You're too afraid.
You cannot jump.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:10.321
Ner-ner-ner ner-ner! Ner-ner-ner ner-ner!
Ner-ner-ner ner-ner! Ner-ner-ner...

00:39:10.404 --> 00:39:12.740
Argh!

00:39:14.158 --> 00:39:15.159
Whoo-hoo!

00:39:15.242 --> 00:39:17.202
- You did it.
- Let's do it again.

00:39:17.286 --> 00:39:19.580
And this time put it out further.

00:39:19.663 --> 00:39:21.998
Come on, Bambi.
You can do it.

00:39:22.082 --> 00:39:24.167
Wait till your dad sees this.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:28.921
- Oh. Good morning, sir.
- Ahem. Morning, Owl.

00:39:28.963 --> 00:39:33.759
Just thought I'd let you know
that the search is off to a flying start.

00:39:33.801 --> 00:39:35.594
Oh! Yes, well,

00:39:35.636 --> 00:39:42.058
no pun intended...
with the... flying... as I'm an... an owl.

00:39:43.727 --> 00:39:45.562
Yes, well.

00:39:45.645 --> 00:39:49.649
I've met with several does already
who would make excellent mothers.

00:39:49.732 --> 00:39:55.154
- Put it out further!
- Unless you've changed your mind?

00:39:55.196 --> 00:39:59.241
- No, I have not.
- Uh... uh...

00:39:59.324 --> 00:40:02.244
Hey, watch this!
Watch this!

00:40:02.327 --> 00:40:03.411
Whoa!

00:40:03.495 --> 00:40:07.498
- Did I make it?
- Yep. You did it.

00:40:08.791 --> 00:40:12.670
- What exactly are you doing?
- I'm practicing my jumps.

00:40:12.712 --> 00:40:15.422
- Yeah. See?
- Mm.

00:40:15.506 --> 00:40:17.341
I see.

00:40:21.678 --> 00:40:25.598
I don't get it.
Yesterday he really liked it.

00:40:25.682 --> 00:40:28.434
What's he doing, anyway?

00:40:28.518 --> 00:40:32.229
I don't know,
but he sure does an awful lot of it.

00:40:32.313 --> 00:40:34.106
Well, why don't you ask him?

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:37.234
Oh, he looks busy.
I better not.

00:40:37.317 --> 00:40:40.112
Parents like it
when you ask them questions -

00:40:40.195 --> 00:40:43.031
lots and lots of questions.

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:46.784
- Really?
- Go on. I'm right behind you.

00:41:01.715 --> 00:41:04.050
Um... uh...

00:41:05.844 --> 00:41:08.971
- What are you doing?
- Observing.

00:41:09.055 --> 00:41:11.515
Oh. Observing.

00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:17.062
- What's observing?
- Well, it's...

00:41:18.147 --> 00:41:19.982
it's...

00:41:21.274 --> 00:41:25.195
- It's difficult to explain.
- Oh.

00:41:27.947 --> 00:41:30.783
You have to look, listen...

00:41:31.409 --> 00:41:34.120
and smell, all at the same time.

00:41:34.203 --> 00:41:36.205
Oh, I can do that.

00:41:36.288 --> 00:41:38.248
Look, listen, smell.

00:41:40.959 --> 00:41:42.961
Hm.

00:41:43.044 --> 00:41:45.880
Try to feel the forest around you.

00:41:51.135 --> 00:41:53.137
I don't feel anything.

00:41:54.138 --> 00:41:57.766
- Does playing in the meadow.
- How do you know?

00:41:57.808 --> 00:42:00.269
I feel it in my hooves.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:04.939
If there was danger,
they'd know to stomp, and I'd run to them.

00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:09.485
- But wouldn't you be scared?
- Perhaps, but I would still run to them.

00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:15.533
A prince may be afraid,
but he can't let fear stop him from acting.

00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:18.702
Wow. You know everything.

00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:23.456
Not everything.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.501
Well, the forest is waiting.

00:42:32.798 --> 00:42:35.176
Are you coming?

00:42:35.217 --> 00:42:37.428
Oh! Sure!

00:42:43.975 --> 00:42:45.769
Big brother!

00:42:45.852 --> 00:42:48.563
Oh, for crying out loud!

00:42:48.646 --> 00:42:51.607
Feel the forest.
Feel the forest.

00:42:51.691 --> 00:42:53.567
- Feel the forest.
- Bambi!

00:42:53.651 --> 00:42:56.195
Feel the...

00:42:56.278 --> 00:42:58.113
Felt it.

00:43:05.161 --> 00:43:09.248
* Why does winter
always make you wait

00:43:09.332 --> 00:43:13.127
* For a glimpse of sun?

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:17.131
* Takes a simple clue or leap of faith

00:43:17.214 --> 00:43:20.092

* Fade into memory
looking at the morning light

00:43:27.974 --> 00:43:33.604
* And we will be together

00:43:33.687 --> 00:43:37.274
* Leaving our cares behind forever

00:43:37.358 --> 00:43:40.402
* At the first sign of spring

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:45.365
* The heat of the sun
will shine right through

00:43:45.448 --> 00:43:49.285
* And never a moment
comes too soon

00:43:49.369 --> 00:43:53.080
* As the first sign of spring

00:43:53.914 --> 00:43:56.208
Grrr!

00:43:59.878 --> 00:44:01.129
Whoa!

00:44:01.213 --> 00:44:05.383
* Air is getting warmer by the day

00:44:05.467 --> 00:44:08.303
* As the thaw begins

00:44:09.387 --> 00:44:13.140
* So put a corner on this page

00:44:13.182 --> 00:44:16.185
* The leaves are green again

00:44:16.268 --> 00:44:19.980
- * And cloudy skies
- I hear it, I hear it!

00:44:20.063 --> 00:44:24.067
* Are lifting away
right in front of our very eyes

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:30.114
* And we will be together

00:44:33.701 --> 00:44:36.537
* At the first sign of spring

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.831
Hm.

00:44:43.543 --> 00:44:45.837
When will I get my antlers?

00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:50.424
Won't be long now
if you're anything like I was.

00:44:50.925 --> 00:44:52.176
Am I?

00:44:52.259 --> 00:44:55.429
Well, only one way to find out.

00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:03.186
Wow!

00:45:03.228 --> 00:45:06.356
* At the first sign of spring

00:45:08.316 --> 00:45:12.111
* A new season"s begun

00:45:12.194 --> 00:45:15.864
* For a father and son

00:45:15.948 --> 00:45:19.910

* At the first sign of spring

00:46:26.179 --> 00:46:29.015
Bambi, time to go to sleep.

00:46:29.724 --> 00:46:32.685
But I can't sleep.
I'm wide awake.

00:46:32.727 --> 00:46:34.478
Try.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.814
OK, I'll try.

00:46:40.525 --> 00:46:42.736
It was funny
when you chased that cricket,

00:46:42.819 --> 00:46:44.988
then there was one more,
then one more.

00:46:45.071 --> 00:46:47.323
Yes, yes.

00:46:47.365 --> 00:46:49.784
Now, get some sleep.

00:46:51.577 --> 00:46:54.538
Flower sleeps all winter.

00:46:54.622 --> 00:46:56.123
Why do we sleep?

00:46:56.206 --> 00:46:58.834
Everything must get rest.

00:46:58.876 --> 00:47:02.546
Some at night, some during the day.

00:47:03.838 --> 00:47:06.174
Some not at all.

00:47:11.887 --> 00:47:14.140
Mother's resting now, isn't she?

00:47:14.223 --> 00:47:15.933
Oh, I forgot.

00:47:16.016 --> 00:47:20.520
A prince leaves the past
in the past, right?

00:47:24.232 --> 00:47:26.693
That's enough questions for today.

00:47:26.734 --> 00:47:28.569
Now, please get some sleep.

00:47:28.611 --> 00:47:30.613
OK.

00:47:31.572 --> 00:47:33.366
Good night.

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:14.445
Grrr!

00:48:18.157 --> 00:48:20.826
Come on, sleepyhead.

00:48:20.909 --> 00:48:25.372
Remind me never to let you
eat blossoms before bedtime.

00:48:25.455 --> 00:48:27.540
Wait. I hear trouble.

00:48:27.624 --> 00:48:29.250
What? What?

00:48:29.333 --> 00:48:31.711
Hornet nest - antler-high.

00:48:32.795 --> 00:48:35.089
Very good.

00:48:35.172 --> 00:48:38.967
- Wait! Now I see trouble.
- Where? Where?

00:48:39.009 --> 00:48:41.344
Rival stag, dead ahead.

00:48:41.386 --> 00:48:44.472
Ah, he's pretty small.
Shouldn't be any trouble.

00:48:44.556 --> 00:48:47.642
Oh, yeah?
I can be plenty of trouble.

00:48:47.684 --> 00:48:51.020
- No, not you.
- Yes, me.

00:48:51.103 --> 00:48:52.146
Yah!

00:48:52.188 --> 00:48:55.816
Now you've had it.

00:48:55.858 --> 00:48:56.984
Gotcha!

00:48:57.026 --> 00:48:59.236
Now who's got who?

00:49:00.987 --> 00:49:04.282
- There you two are. Well, yes.
- Hello, Friend Owl.

00:49:04.366 --> 00:49:06.326
Well, he-hello.

00:49:06.367 --> 00:49:09.454
I've... I've been
meaning to speak to you.

00:49:09.537 --> 00:49:13.249
I've been looking everywhere.
I thought you'd be by the meadow now.

00:49:13.332 --> 00:49:16.085
I'm afraid I got a little...

00:49:17.169 --> 00:49:18.420
distracted.

00:49:18.504 --> 00:49:23.091
So I see. Well, no matter.
I usually find what I'm after.

00:49:23.174 --> 00:49:27.845
Speaking of which,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

00:49:27.929 --> 00:49:30.556
- Mena.
- Great Prince.

00:49:30.598 --> 00:49:33.142
- Bambi, go to the den.
- Bambi.

00:49:33.225 --> 00:49:37.187
I've heard so much about you. You know,
your mama and I grew up together.

00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:39.356
- You did?
- Go to the den.

00:49:39.439 --> 00:49:41.191
But I want to hear about Mother.

00:49:41.274 --> 00:49:45.195
There'll be plenty of time for that
once you're settled in your new home.

00:49:47.238 --> 00:49:49.073
You're sending me away?

00:49:49.115 --> 00:49:51.576
No. Just...
just let me explain.

00:49:51.617 --> 00:49:53.828
But I did everything you said.

00:49:53.911 --> 00:49:57.748
- I even heard with my hooves.
- Bambi, a prince does not...

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:00.876
- That's all you care about - not me.
- Don't speak to me...

00:50:00.959 --> 00:50:04.296
I wish Mother was here instead of you!

00:50:06.631 --> 00:50:11.761
Oh, my, my, my. Well, I've certainly
made a muddle of things.

00:50:11.802 --> 00:50:13.846
No. This is my fault.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.141
Bambi needs a mother.

00:50:17.224 --> 00:50:20.727
A prince should not be raising a child.

00:50:28.151 --> 00:50:30.778
I'm sure gonna miss you guys.

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.531
Don't worry.
We'll see each other again.

00:50:33.614 --> 00:50:34.615
Uh-huh.

00:50:34.657 --> 00:50:38.118
We'll come visit you, if it's not too far.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.997
- But Mama says it is too far.
- Shh!

00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:48.211
And if you get scared, just be scarier
than whatever's scaring you.

00:50:48.294 --> 00:50:50.046
Grrr!

00:50:50.129 --> 00:50:52.340
Bambi.

00:50:52.381 --> 00:50:54.258
It's time to go.

00:50:54.341 --> 00:50:57.011
I'll never forget any of you.

00:50:57.052 --> 00:51:01.932
Of course not.
Can't forget your bestest friend.

00:51:05.226 --> 00:51:07.854
Being a prince means sacrifice.

00:51:08.896 --> 00:51:11.399
He must ignore his feelings

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.360
and do what is best for others.

00:51:15.236 --> 00:51:17.821
Do you understand?

00:51:18.822 --> 00:51:21.074
I'll visit you soon.

00:51:21.158 --> 00:51:22.951
Be good for Mena.

00:51:26.579 --> 00:51:29.207
And never forget...

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:32.251
you are the prince.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.483
Hello, Princess.

00:52:44.859 --> 00:52:47.403
You're not leaving
without saying goodbye?

00:52:47.487 --> 00:52:50.531
Ah, and I thought we were pals.

00:52:50.615 --> 00:52:53.492
I feel for you.
Gosh, I really do.

00:52:53.576 --> 00:52:57.246
It's gotta be hard to have a father
that's so ashamed of you

00:52:57.329 --> 00:52:59.539
that he'd give you away.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.714
Oh, yeah?

00:53:10.758 --> 00:53:11.926
Bambi!

00:53:14.637 --> 00:53:17.056
Argh!

00:53:22.519 --> 00:53:24.896
Bambi!
Are you all right?

00:53:39.534 --> 00:53:41.953
Both of you get out of here. Now!

00:53:42.037 --> 00:53:44.039
Mommy!

00:53:45.623 --> 00:53:47.584
Bambi, run!

00:53:54.673 --> 00:53:56.467
Run, Bambi!

00:54:02.013 --> 00:54:05.141
Faster, Bambi.
Don't look back! Keep running!

00:54:05.225 --> 00:54:07.393
Keep running!

00:54:14.942 --> 00:54:17.319
Bambi!

00:54:19.112 --> 00:54:21.031
Baa!

00:54:35.044 --> 00:54:37.713
Where's Bambi?

00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:51.976
Look! It's Bambi!

00:54:53.019 --> 00:54:54.645
Argh!

00:54:54.687 --> 00:54:57.981
We gotta help him.
Make your brave face.

00:54:58.065 --> 00:55:01.026
- This one? Grrr!
- Braver!

00:55:01.068 --> 00:55:04.487
- This one? Grrr!
- No, no.

00:55:04.529 --> 00:55:08.199
Make the bravest face
you ever made in your whole life.

00:55:08.283 --> 00:55:10.493
This one? Grrr!

00:55:13.079 --> 00:55:15.748
That's the one.

00:55:35.849 --> 00:55:40.687
Aha! Looky who's here. I guess
somebody didn't learn their lesson.

00:55:40.729 --> 00:55:42.355
I learned plenty.

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:44.190
Aaarrgh!

00:55:44.232 --> 00:55:46.526
Argh! Argh! Argh!
Argh! Argh! Argh!

00:55:46.568 --> 00:55:48.403
Argh!

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:38.045
Bambi!

00:58:09.866 --> 00:58:12.076
Bambi!

00:58:23.878 --> 00:58:25.713
Bambi?

00:58:27.257 --> 00:58:29.425
Get up.

00:58:30.635 --> 00:58:32.386
Get up!

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:34.805
A prince does not...

00:59:27.228 --> 00:59:29.022
Dad.

00:59:33.651 --> 00:59:36.153
I'm here.

00:59:37.112 --> 00:59:39.281
I'm here.

01:00:10.935 --> 01:00:13.312
It was raining and thundering.

01:00:13.396 --> 01:00:16.774
It didn't look good for the young prince.

01:00:16.857 --> 01:00:19.818
There were thousands of dogs,

01:00:19.901 --> 01:00:22.529
but Bambi wasn't a bit scared.

01:00:22.612 --> 01:00:25.698
They came closer...
and closer.

01:00:25.782 --> 01:00:28.618
There was nowhere to go.

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:34.915
Then a dog that was tall as a tree
roared from the shadows,

01:00:34.957 --> 01:00:36.667
but Bambi was too fast.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.961
- He jumped up...
- High in the air.

01:00:40.545 --> 01:00:43.215
- And then came crashing...
- Crashing down.

01:00:43.298 --> 01:00:45.842
Right on the big dog's head.

01:00:45.925 --> 01:00:50.012
Quiet. I'm telling it.
But the best part was...

01:00:50.096 --> 01:00:54.850
The best part was when Thumper helped
Flower make his bravest brave face.

01:00:54.934 --> 01:00:58.604
And scared all the dogs away.
Oops.

01:00:59.521 --> 01:01:01.731
Uh-huh.
That's how it went.

01:01:01.815 --> 01:01:03.942
Hooray for Thumper!

01:01:04.025 --> 01:01:06.444
- Look who's here.
- Oh, the young prince.

01:01:06.528 --> 01:01:08.821
Hooray!

01:01:08.863 --> 01:01:11.574
You know, they're OK for sisters.

01:01:11.657 --> 01:01:15.327
- Just too bad they're girls.
- Hey.

01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:16.829
Oops.

01:01:16.912 --> 01:01:19.248
What do you know, Bambi!

01:01:19.706 --> 01:01:21.541
Ooh!

01:01:24.044 --> 01:01:27.714
Well, looks like
those antlers are finally coming in.

01:01:27.797 --> 01:01:29.924
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:33.094
Thumper's been telling us quite a story.

01:01:33.177 --> 01:01:37.723
Yes, yes.
The one with the thousands of dogs.

01:01:37.806 --> 01:01:38.932
Thousands?

01:01:39.016 --> 01:01:42.435
What can I say?
I'm a born storyteller.

01:01:42.519 --> 01:01:45.230
I'll bet it seemed like a thousand dogs.

01:01:47.065 --> 01:01:48.191
Oh!

01:01:48.274 --> 01:01:51.485
- Ooh!
- Uh... uh... uh...

01:01:52.486 --> 01:01:54.446
Twitterpated.

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:56.907
What's twitterpated?

01:01:56.949 --> 01:02:01.620
Well, it's...
I'll tell you when you're older.

01:02:01.703 --> 01:02:05.331
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the young prince.

01:02:05.415 --> 01:02:09.043
One of these days we'll meet up again,
and when we do...

01:02:09.127 --> 01:02:10.920
Whoa!

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.468
Argh! Aaargh!

01:02:17.551 --> 01:02:20.595
Get it off! Get it off!
Mommy! Get it off!

01:02:20.679 --> 01:02:24.057
Mommy! Argh! Argh!

01:02:24.099 --> 01:02:28.478
See? I told you turtles were scary.

01:02:31.939 --> 01:02:35.568
Oh! I gotta get going.
My dad's waiting for me.

01:02:35.609 --> 01:02:37.986
Bye, Bambi.

01:02:39.071 --> 01:02:43.575
Ah, Bambi,
you never have time for us anymore.

01:02:43.658 --> 01:02:46.161
Yeah. Isn't it wonderful?

01:02:50.957 --> 01:02:53.209
Hey, Dad.
Where are we going today?

01:02:53.292 --> 01:02:55.628
We're already there.

01:03:12.518 --> 01:03:14.311
Wow.

01:03:14.395 --> 01:03:16.647
I never even knew this was here.

01:03:17.356 --> 01:03:19.775
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:03:26.698 --> 01:03:28.950
This is...

01:03:30.034 --> 01:03:33.370
This is where I first met your mother.

01:03:36.874 --> 01:03:39.835
- Really?
- Yes.

01:03:39.918 --> 01:03:42.212
I was just about your age.

01:03:45.381 --> 01:03:47.050
What were you like?

01:03:47.133 --> 01:03:50.720
Me? Well, let me think.

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:56.767
Actually, I was a lot like you.

01:03:59.686 --> 01:04:04.441
* For it"s out of the darkness
that we learn to see

01:04:04.524 --> 01:04:09.070
* And out of the silence
that songs come to be

01:04:09.153 --> 01:04:15.784
* And all that we dream of
awaits patiently

01:04:15.868 --> 01:04:21.581
