00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:22.233
What was that?

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:16.318
Yes? Southern Sea Salvage,
Ogata speaking.

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.858
What?

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.300
Right, I understand.
As soon as possible.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.713
Emiko, I'm sorry...

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.943
What is it? An accident?

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.412
The Coast Guard received
a distress call.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.422
I'll have to cancel
our date tonight.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.991
I'm sorry I can't go with you,

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:53.759
but you can still see it
if you hurry.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.664
It's a shame, but it's your job.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:03:59.763
Well, you'd better hurry.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.513
Southern Sea Steamship Company
vessel, the "Eiko-maru,"

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:16.954
a 7,500-ton freighter,
was reported lost...

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:18.581
on August 13 at 19:05 hours.

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:21.116
Its last position,
latitude 24 degrees north,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.889
longitude 141.02 degrees east.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:26.228
Contact was lost
for unknown reasons.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.963
All units in sectors 3 and 4
stand by for action!

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.031
Thank you for calling me.

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.807
Thank you again.
What could have happened?

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:41.971
We have no idea.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.984
It seems like there was
a sudden explosion.

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.315
Communications suddenly halted

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.047
shortly after we received
their SOS.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:52.119
Well, the "Bingo-maru" is
approaching the area now.

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:53.853
We'll learn more soon enough.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:02.957
They are here.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.958
Certainly. The "Eiko-maru" and
"Bingo-maru" are both owned

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:31.519
by the Southern Sea
Steamship Company.

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:33.589
Yes. They don't know how.

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:37.501
Can't you tell us
if any survivors were seen?

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:39.437
Please wait a little longer.

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:43.602
We have a helicopter and two
ships searching the area now.

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:48.307
We won't be sure of anything
until we get their report.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.816
Excuse me,
why not send more ships?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.410
Two ships are not enough
for this!

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:56.479
No, we're not limiting
the search party to two ships.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.956
We'll make every effort
to conduct a thorough search.

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.424
Until then, please be patient.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.633
Hey!

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.466
Help us, please!

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.373
We're here! Hang in there!

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:18.805
It was incredible.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.540
The ocean just blew up!

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.604
Blew up?

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.585
So far, three survivors were
picked up by a fishing boat.

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:33.183
They are being taken
to Odo Island.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.662
We have sent the vessel "Kotaka"
to assist them.

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:38.687
Which ship
were the survivors from...

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.596
the "Eiko-maru"
or the "Bingo-maru"?

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:41.793
We are still investigating,

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:43.802
but their names will be released
soon enough.

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:49.206
I hope the three men know
what happened.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:52.302
We need to know more
about the accidents.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.611
Just a moment! Please, wait!

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.384
What's the matter?

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.693
I can't believe it.

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.427
I just can't believe it!

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:19.465
The fishing boat sank
the same way.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.302
News desk! Ah, Mr. Yamana?

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.776
Mr. Yamana, the other search
boat was sunk!

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.745
In the same area... yes.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.508
Yes, in the same way!

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.106
We're tired of hearing
the same thing!

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:31.411
Please tell us what happened!

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.510
Please give us a chance
to investigate!

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:34.952
Don't you know what's going on?

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.488
I'm sorry,
but you must be patient!

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:37.580
Wait, please wait!

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.927
A drifting sea mine, or an
underwater volcanic eruption?

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:47.865
One shipwreck after another!

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:18.625
I can't imagine,
could it be a volcano?

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.364
Izuma! Is there something
out there?

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:29.070
Ah, it's a raft!

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:32.134
Hey, there's a raft out there!

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.646
A raft is coming this way!

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.807
A raft is coming!

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:47.818
Hey! Over here!

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.693
Build up the fire!
Build up the fire!

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:10.241
It's Masaji! It's Masaji!

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:16.344
Masaji!

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:19.924
Masaji! Hold on! Masaji!

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.015
Hang on!

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.701
Brother!

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:34.501
Masaji! Masaji!

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.564
Masaji!

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:41.713
He did it...

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:42.941
What?!

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:44.277
A monster...

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:48.310
What did this?!
Masaji! What did this?!

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.417
It's no good!
We didn't catch anything!

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.589
It can't get any worse
than this!

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:10.575
Then...
Godzilla must have done it.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.478
The old man and Godzilla,
both relics from days past!

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:20.978
Hey! What do you know
about the old days?!

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:23.248
If you all keep thinking
like that,

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.587
you'll all become prey
for Godzilla!

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:53.952
Anyhow, there must be
some kind of animal in the sea.

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:56.546
That's why
we can't catch anything.

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:58.557
But a creature that big would...

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:00.889
I knew it was stupid
to open my mouth!

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:03.861
I try to tell you all,
but nobody listens!

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.523
Shinkichi, let's go.

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:08.055
Ah, sir! Sir, sir!

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.248
Godzilla?

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:26.979
It's the name of a monster
that lives in the sea.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:34.983
It will come from the ocean
to feed on humankind to survive.

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:38.986
In the old days, during times
when the fishing was poor,

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:42.990
we used to sacrifice girls

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:48.974
to prevent him
from eating us all, yes!

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:51.670
Now, this exorcism ceremony

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:56.978
is all that remains
of the old traditions.

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.881
Godzilla?

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:02.280
Shinkichi!

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:04.282
Shinkichi! Stay inside!

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:07.074
Shinkichi!

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.178
Shinkichi!

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:13.253
Brother!

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:40.114
Brother! Run, brother!
Brother! Run, brother!

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.985
Hey, hey!
Shinkichi, what's wrong?!

00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:44.044
Brother!

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:39.334
Odo Island Representatives

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.390
Mr. Ooyama.

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:57.088
There have been 17 houses
destroyed with nine deaths...

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:59.620
I have heard that there
were other damages.

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:02.156
Could you please tell us
how bad they are?

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:05.864
Odo Island Village Mayor,
Mr. Inada.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:11.969
Certainly, of course.
Twelve cows and eight pigs died.

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:15.277
I'm not lying!

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:19.045
It was hard to see in the dark,
but it was an animal!

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:23.421
I know it goes
against common sense,

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:26.424
but the more I think about it,
the more I am convinced

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:28.949
that it was definitely not
a normal hurricane.

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:32.690
The way the houses
and helicopter were destroyed,

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:36.030
it seems as if they were crushed
from above!

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:40.204
Now, finally,
we will hear the opinion

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:44.141
of expert paleontologist
Professor Kyohei Yamane.

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:56.977
I suppose my opinion
is a bit premature

00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:01.355
before a thorough investigation,

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:08.458
but we are all aware of
the discovery in the Himalayas

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.164
of the alleged
"snowman footprints."

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:17.141
It is a mystery
we have yet to solve.

00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:23.308
The earth has many deep pockets,
abyssal regions

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:29.151
that contain secrets
we have yet to discover.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.850
For this incident,
I request the formation

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.087
of a fact-finding party
for a full investigation.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.161
Good Luck,
Odo Island Research Party!

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.111
Good-bye!

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.378
We'll see you soon!

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:16.324
It was surprising to see
Dr. Serizawa at our departure.

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:19.496
He rarely leaves his laboratory.

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:22.200
I don't know if he believes
this will be our final journey.

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:24.607
Well, what could go wrong?

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.286
Of course, we can avoid
dangerous waters,

00:17:37.322 --> 00:17:39.290
but anything can happen.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:37.882
For the time being,

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:39.577
please don't use the water
from this well.

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:40.607
It's dangerous.

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:43.614
This is horrible!

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:46.453
We can't use the well anymore?

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:49.461
Professor, if there was
radioactive fallout,

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:53.864
wouldn't the wells on the other
side of the island be affected?

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:56.299
Yes. Why is it that the wells

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:59.736
in this area
were the only ones affected?

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:01.432
It doesn't make any sense.

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:18.322
Mr. Hagiwara, I think

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:23.226
this depression might be
the footprint of a creature.

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.127
Would you agree with me?

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.291
Is that true, Professor?

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:54.151
This footprint is radioactive.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:57.253
Everybody, it's very dangerous
here! Please step back!

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:59.389
Step back! Step back!

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:14.545
Emiko, look!

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.979
It's a trilobite!

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:19.381
A three-lobed creature that has
long since been extinct!

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:21.579
Professor!
You shouldn't be touching that!

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.387
Professor, what is that thing?

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:31.828
This is...
an incredible discovery!

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:49.212
It's on the other side
of the hill!

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.216
It's on the other
side of the hill!

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.636
Father!

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:19.608
What is it?

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:23.706
Tanabe, I saw it!

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:25.683
A creature
from the Jurassic Period!

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:27.480
Where is it?

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.797
Emiko! Emiko!

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:22.371
Emiko!

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:26.272
Father!

00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:29.007
This way! This way!

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:40.452
This way! This way!

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:46.531
What is that?

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:47.554
Those are footprints.

00:22:56.441 --> 00:23:02.710
About 2 million years ago,
this brontosaurus

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:08.744
and these other dinosaurs
roamed the earth

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:12.951
during a period
the experts called Jurassic.

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:15.653
During the following
geological period,

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:17.423
the Cretaceous,

00:23:17.462 --> 00:23:21.694
a creature somewhere between
the marine reptiles

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:25.829
and the evolving
terrestrial animals was born.

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:30.808
I am convinced there was such
an intermediate creature.

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:40.780
This creature, according
to Odo Island folklore,

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:43.287
is called Godzilla.

00:23:45.657 --> 00:23:49.753
As we look at this photo
of Godzilla's head

00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:52.525
from a hill on Odo Island,

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:55.965
we can estimate
that this creature

00:23:56.001 --> 00:24:00.131
stands approximately
50 meters tall.

00:24:00.172 --> 00:24:02.538
So then, how can we explain

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:07.841
the presence of such a creature
during the present day?

00:24:07.879 --> 00:24:10.143
It probably survived

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:17.111
by eating deep sea organisms
occupying a specific niche.

00:24:17.155 --> 00:24:20.955
However, recent experimental
nuclear detonations

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:25.052
may have drastically altered
its natural habitat.

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:29.123
I would even speculate
that a hydrogen bomb explosion

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:32.796
may have removed it
from its surroundings.

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:35.065
Incredible!

00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:36.130
Really!

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:40.170
I have strong evidence
to support my theory.

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:43.642
First, the organism
we found embedded

00:24:43.682 --> 00:24:45.445
in Godzilla's footprint,
a trilobite.

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:48.453
This is a photo of the creature.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.579
This is it.

00:24:56.561 --> 00:25:00.497
This creature has been extinct
for two million years,

00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:03.899
yet here it is
in perfect physical condition.

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.731
Next is the sediment

00:25:09.774 --> 00:25:12.834
that we found
in the trilobite's shell.

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:14.641
That sediment is sand.

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:17.614
There is no doubt that this sand

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:22.416
matches the deposits found
from the Jurassic period.

00:25:22.454 --> 00:25:24.217
This sand is similar
to the red clay

00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:26.588
found in the stratum
of that particular period.

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:27.956
Professor, how do you know

00:25:27.993 --> 00:25:30.689
that this has something to do
with the atomic bombs?

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:33.857
Because
our Geiger counter readings

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:36.595
of the radiation in this sand

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:40.071
indicate the presence
of Strontium-90.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:45.668
Professor Tanabiya will explain
this better in a moment,

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:50.511
but basically, this sand
that came from Godzilla

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:53.382
has absorbed
a massive dose of radiation,

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:56.512
the type generated
only from an atomic bomb.

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:03.826
Order, please! Order, please!

00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:16.266
The evidence suggests
that Godzilla itself

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:22.872
must have absorbed an enormous
amount of atomic radiation.

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:31.580
Order, please! Order, please!

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:33.090
Chairman! Chairman!

00:26:33.992 --> 00:26:35.960
Mr. Ooyama.

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:38.757
I believe
Professor Yamane's report

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:43.461
is of such extreme importance,
it must not be made public.

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:47.134
What are you saying?!

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:48.730
Because it is so important,
it should be made public!

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:49.762
Yes! Yes!

00:26:52.143 --> 00:26:54.543
Be quiet!

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:57.810
What I mean is, if this Godzilla

00:26:57.849 --> 00:27:02.684
is the product from the use
of atomic weapons...

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:04.655
Exactly!
That's exactly what it is!

00:27:04.689 --> 00:27:05.747
She's right!

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:07.918
That's my point!

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:10.187
World affairs are fragile enough
as it is!

00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:11.889
If this were to be made public,

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.625
can you imagine
the consequences?

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:14.757
The truth is the truth!

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.767
That is what makes it
such a delicate matter!

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:21.228
The improper handling
of such a notion

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:24.139
would engulf the country
in a panic!

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:27.269
The government, the economy
and international relations

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:28.939
would plunge into total chaos!

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:31.140
You stupid idiot!
What are you saying?!

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:32.206
You dare to call me an idiot?!

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.877
Apologize! Apologize!

00:27:33.918 --> 00:27:35.715
The truth must be made public!

00:27:43.962 --> 00:27:47.796
Counter-Godzilla Headquarters
Established.

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:52.235
Seventeen Ships Already Lost.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.362
It's terrible, huh?

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:55.305
Contaminated tuna
and radioactive fallout,

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.604
and now this Godzilla
to top it all off!

00:27:57.642 --> 00:28:00.236
What will happen if he appears
out of Tokyo Bay?

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:04.078
First, he'll probably eat you
in one bite.

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:05.412
You're horrible!

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.214
They seemed certain about
the accuracy of their report.

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.880
How could we create
such a thing?

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:12.446
I guess I'll have to find
a shelter soon.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.185
Find one for me, too!

00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:18.161
The shelters again?
That stinks.

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:24.926
Counter-Godzilla Headquarters

00:28:25.003 --> 00:28:29.030
Isn't there any way they can get
rid of this creature?

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:42.682
Longitude 138
to 138.07 degrees east.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:47.749
Latitude 33.04
to 33.08 degrees north.

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:52.491
These are the coordinates of
the anti-Godzilla frigate fleet.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.761
Depth charges will be dropped
in the area.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:01.136
So vessels in the vicinity
should be warned.

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:03.640
That's all.

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:04.642
Is that all?

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:05.665
That's all.

00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:56.186
In response
to the public outcry,

00:29:56.227 --> 00:29:58.127
the government is attempting

00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:01.621
to get rid of the monster
known as Godzilla.

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:02.963
A frigate fleet has been ordered

00:30:03.034 --> 00:30:04.626
to begin
a massive depth-charge attack

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:06.159
in order to get rid
of the creature.

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:09.867
The 10 vessel fleet left port
at 10:00 a.m.,

00:30:09.908 --> 00:30:12.968
heading for the coast
of Odo Island.

00:30:13.044 --> 00:30:14.102
At 10:19 a.m.,

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:16.306
they received orders
to commence with their attack.

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:28.055
What's wrong with them?

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:31.523
The professor is a zoologist.

00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:33.793
He doesn't want them
to kill Godzilla.

00:30:35.233 --> 00:30:38.396
Father! Father!

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:53.739
Father...

00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:57.985
Please leave me alone
for a while.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.987
Emiko, please turn off
the light.

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:08.254
Yes.

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:12.756
Godzilla! It's Godzilla!

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:22.229
Watch out! Watch out!
Please don't panic!

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:35.718
What a bother!

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.345
Have you tried solving
the problem together?

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:39.253
They're sticking
to their point of view.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.656
How much longer will they
keep us waiting like this?

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:43.661
For as long as they want.

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:45.754
It's annoying!

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.130
Please, Professor. Have a seat.

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:51.157
Excuse me.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:53.962
Thank you for coming.

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:55.029
You're welcome.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.769
This is quite a problem,
Professor.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.772
If this keeps up,

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.807
we'll have to suspend
the international ship routes.

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.642
Have you found a way?

00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:12.815
Is there something we can do
to defeat him?

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:16.950
So, that's it?

00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:20.457
Professor Yamane,
let's be honest.

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:24.992
If there's a way to defeat
Godzilla, we'd like to know.

00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:27.860
It's impossible!

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:33.505
He absorbed massive amounts
of atomic radiation,

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:35.444
but Godzilla still survived.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.243
What do you think
could kill him?

00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:46.313
Instead, we should focus
on why he is still alive.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:49.349
That should be our top priority!

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:05.198
Professor Yamane's argument
is absolutely correct!

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:06.801
This isn't the time
to behave like idiots.

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:08.334
We should focus
on scientific research!

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:10.347
Yes, but research at what cost?

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.849
You're right!
That's the question!

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:16.786
Hagiwara, interview
this gentleman.

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.123
Dr. Serizawa?

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.959
Yes, he's Professor Yamane's
future son-in-law.

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:28.021
Oh? The girl's fiance?

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:32.029
I'm sure my father
will understand.

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:38.375
There's no reason
for him to apologize.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:41.640
But I can't help feeling uneasy
when I think about Serizawa.

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:46.976
If it wasn't for the war,

00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:50.179
he wouldn't have received
such a terrible scar.

00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:51.347
Ogata...

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.950
Ever since I was a child,

00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:59.895
I've always thought of him
as an older brother.

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:03.799
Even now, my feelings for him
have not changed at all.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.262
Emiko, thanks.

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.814
Miss, Mr. Hagiwara would like
to see you.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.943
Mr. Hagiwara?

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:21.974
Yes, the reporter.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.682
Hello! Excuse me.

00:35:25.723 --> 00:35:26.417
Thank you.

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:29.751
What do you want?

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:32.228
Um... I'd like
to ask you a favor.

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:34.959
The truth is, I tried
to talk to Dr. Serizawa,

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:36.624
but he refused to see me.

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:39.795
So, I was wondering if you could
introduce me to him?

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:42.169
It's for our daily newspaper.

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:44.834
I'm sorry, but I need your help.

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.541
It's perfect.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.983
I should go along with you to
speak with Serizawa personally.

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:59.421
You're right, but I should break
it to him my way.

00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:03.860
Please let me go
to speak with him first.

00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:08.889
You're right. Well, go ahead.

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:11.060
Thank you. I'm sorry,
but we should go.

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:12.865
I have a ride waiting outside.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.973
I'll try my best to talk to him.

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:30.820
I'll help Shinkichi
with his studies. See you later.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:03.711
Serizawa Research Laboratory

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:07.315
There must be some mistake.

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:09.053
I haven't spoken to anyone

00:37:09.093 --> 00:37:11.425
about the importance
of my research.

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:13.930
It's the truth.
A journalist in Switzerland

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:17.264
met with a German scientist
who stated that your project

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:20.202
would be
an incredible breakthrough

00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:24.607
in anti-Godzilla operations
in Japan when completed.

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:28.100
I don't have any German
scientist associates.

00:37:28.145 --> 00:37:33.082
Really? Then what is the nature
of your research right now?

00:37:33.117 --> 00:37:36.109
No. I'd rather not speak
about it.

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:43.750
Well, thank you for your time.

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:46.092
No, I'm sorry
that I wasn't much help.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.789
Excuse me.

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:50.400
I'll stay a little longer.

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:52.595
Really? Then, I'll be going.

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:19.218
I wanted to find out
what his research was all about.

00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:20.924
He's very moody,

00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:24.525
but please try to ask him again
at another time.

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:26.297
I will. Good-bye.

00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:28.134
Have a safe trip.

00:38:46.123 --> 00:38:50.958
Well, what are you really
studying now?

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:53.656
My father is also wondering

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:56.531
what you are studying
these days.

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:07.039
Emiko, would you like to see it?

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.404
Yes.

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:13.781
This must be
strictly confidential.

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:15.308
Sure.

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.913
I'm risking my life
in this project.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.815
Would you be able
to keep it a secret?

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:24.987
Follow me.

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:56.917
Wow!

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:07.962
Get back!

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:42.398
Emiko, you're the only one
I've shown this to.

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:45.399
Don't forget it.

00:41:48.038 --> 00:41:49.835
Yes, I'll keep my promise.

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.949
Welcome back. We missed you.

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:04.977
Welcome home.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.730
Did anything happen?

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:21.863
No, it was nothing.

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:05.908
Has Emiko come back?

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:06.939
Yes!

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:29.829
Godzilla!
Godzilla has come back!

00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:42.447
Ogata!

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:48.849
I couldn't tell him about us.

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:59.924
I am Yamane, Professor Yamane!

00:44:59.963 --> 00:45:03.899
I'm sorry, but I've been ordered
not to let anyone pass!

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:06.459
Then tell your commander
not to use lights on Godzilla!

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:07.902
They will only make him angry!

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:09.235
He can't be bothered
by that now!

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:11.366
Professor,
let's go to that hill.

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:15.775
Get back, please!
Get back, please!

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:36.209
International Researchers
to Assist!

00:47:55.372 --> 00:48:00.776
We are preparing to construct
a 30 meter high, 80 meter deep

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:03.837
barbed-wire fence
along the coast.

00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.406
We will send 50,000 volts
of electric current

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.908
through the fence in hope of
electrocuting Godzilla to death.

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:13.753
We will have
to evacuate the people

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:16.782
along the coast, of course,

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:21.423
and maintain a safe distance
of 500 meters

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:25.333
from the entire fence perimeter.

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:29.829
The Coast Guard and the Army
will work

00:48:29.873 --> 00:48:33.673
to implement this defense plan.

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:56.221
Hurry! Hurry!

00:48:58.068 --> 00:49:02.129
This is a Security
Command Announcement.

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:07.474
At 16:30 hours, Godzilla was
sighted north of Kasonzaki,

00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:10.605
moving in a northeast direction.

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:12.740
A maximum security alert
has been issued

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:15.183
for the coastal zones
in the Tokyo vicinity.

00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:39.002
Third District. Third District.

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:44.965
Check! Check!

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.236
Third district!

00:50:48.745 --> 00:50:50.007
Check!

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:53.879
This is a special news report.
This is a special news report.

00:50:53.917 --> 00:50:57.114
All residents of the Minato,
Shinagawa and Osaku districts

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:59.122
are to begin evacuating
immediately.

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:03.556
Repeating, all residents
of the Minato, Shinagawa

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:07.393
and Osaku districts are
to begin evacuating immediately.

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:10.195
Please keep your radio on
for further reports.

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:15.603
Emiko, today I'm going to ask
for your father's consent.

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:17.937
Will that be all right?

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:24.472
Welcome home.

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:36.759
What happened, Father?

00:51:50.307 --> 00:51:52.468
All they can think about
is killing Godzilla.

00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:57.012
Why can't they try to study him
from a radiological perspective?

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.918
It's an unique opportunity!

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:08.348
Professor, I agree with them.

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:12.191
Ogata, I do not take
this matter lightly.

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:13.662
Godzilla is something

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:16.393
that no one in the world
has ever seen,

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:19.402
and only those of us in Japan
can study it!

00:52:19.436 --> 00:52:22.530
But, Professor, that's
no reason to do nothing

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:25.268
while this monster
ravages our country.

00:52:25.308 --> 00:52:27.640
Isn't Godzilla a product
of the atomic bomb

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:29.736
that still haunts
many of us Japanese?

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:31.246
Don't you think we should study

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.078
what keeps a creature
like this alive,

00:52:33.116 --> 00:52:34.947
regardless of the radiation
it absorbs!

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.680
But...

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.484
All you want is
to kill Godzilla, too?!

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:41.718
Go away! Get out of my house!

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:50.959
I'm very sorry.

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:57.173
No, I shouldn't have
upset him like that.

00:52:57.207 --> 00:53:00.404
No, Father has been like this.

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:10.150
Emiko, give me a chance
to see him again.

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:17.522
This is a special bulletin!

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.358
This is
a special bulletin!

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:20.556
Godzilla was spotted

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:23.395
moving toward the coastline
several minutes ago.

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:25.867
The barbed-wire fence
along the shoreline

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:28.735
is about to be charged
with high voltage electricity.

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:29.864
We repeat...

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:35.911
Direction, 25 to 30 degrees!

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:38.244
Distance, 850!

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:22.884
Fires are raging through
the Shihabara district.

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:24.917
We have no way to put them out.

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:28.930
This is Central Command,
come in, unit 465.

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:32.331
Central Command,
this is unit 465.

00:59:32.368 --> 00:59:34.563
The fire that started
in Mitadai-machi

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:36.435
has spread to other districts!

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:39.635
This is Central Command,
come in, unit 215.

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:42.042
Central Command, unit 215.

00:59:42.078 --> 00:59:44.842
Our defense lines have broken!

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.371
Armored division #49
has been destroyed!

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.145
The current position
of the target is unknown.

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:49.674
We are awaiting further orders,
please!

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:54.713
Attention all units!
Attention all units!

00:59:54.757 --> 00:59:57.726
Initiate Security
Command code 129!

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.752
Initiate Security Command
code 129!

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:01.957
Prepare to repel attack

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.295
while carrying out
firefighting procedures.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:07.303
Concentrate efforts
to rescue casualties.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.965
Initiate Security Command
code 129!

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:12.803
Initiate Security
Command code 129!

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:37.315
We'll be joining your father
in just a moment!

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.658
A little longer,
a little longer,

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.857
and we'll be with your daddy!

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:23.670
This is unbelievable,
absolutely unbelievable!

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:26.607
Yet, the unbelievable
is happening at this moment,

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:28.234
right before our very eyes!

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:32.111
Right now, Godzilla is leaving
behind a sea of flame!

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:35.743
From Ginza-Owari to Shinbashi,
Tamachi, Chiba and Shinabara,

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:38.253
it's all become a sea of flames!

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.778
Now, Godzilla is starting
to move again!

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:43.724
It appears that he is moving
beyond the city limits!

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.355
To all of our viewers,
this is not a play or a movie!

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:48.624
This is real,

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.723
the most extraordinary story
of the century!

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.894
Is the world going
to be destroyed

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.096
by a two million-year-old
monster?

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:55.096
All personnel to the shelters!

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.996
All personnel
to the shelters!

01:03:57.099 --> 01:04:00.000
Quickly, please!
Quickly, please!

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:04.471
Operational Command Staff,
proceed to shelter 306!

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:58.794
We are reporting to you live
from a short-wave transmitter.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:01.661
Godzilla is now approaching
this broadcasting station,

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.221
heading toward our TV tower!

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:12.139
There is no time for us
to take cover!

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:14.074
We don't know
what will happen to us!

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.668
He is getting even closer!

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:17.178
It looks like our doom!

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:19.948
I'm watching as he grabs
onto the tower!

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.108
He has incredible strength!

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.378
This broadcast is over!

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.079
Good-bye, everyone, good-bye!

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:41.700
Godzilla has turned Tokyo
into a sea of flames!

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.967
He is moving from Ueno
to Asakusa and Shinagawa,

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.700
apparently heading
for the river!

01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:11.993
Damn it! Damn it!

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.263
Damn it!

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:36.385
Damn it! Damn it!

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:09.175
He's running away!

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:37.336
He'll be back!
What can we do?

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:38.346
Damn it!

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.780
How can we get rid of him?!
Damn it!

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:14.077
Godzilla has retreated
back into the sea.

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:17.085
Professor Yamane has been asked
to work on a plan

01:09:17.119 --> 01:09:18.609
to defeat the monster.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.554
No details are known
at this time.

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.079
That is the news for now.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:29.058
Mr. Ogata
from Southern Sea Salvage.

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:31.828
Mr. Ogata from
Southern Sea Salvage.

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:34.927
There has been a change
in the scheduled timetable.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.063
Please report
to the briefing room

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.698
for further instructions.

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:12.338
Thank you for your help.

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:15.367
Your mother will be okay.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.369
Emiko...

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:30.281
Ogata, I have something
important to tell you!

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.771
I can't stay quiet anymore!

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.803
I must betray him.

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.212
Betray?

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.945
Yes. I made a promise
to Serizawa.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.976
Serizawa?

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.717
It's a secret I've been keeping,
even from you!

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:04.726
But, now, I have
to break my promise!

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:07.955
It happened on the day

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:10.932
that Mr. Hagiwara and I
went to see him.

01:11:10.966 --> 01:11:12.797
That's when it happened.

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:24.872
Get back!

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:15.829
What was that?

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:21.860
Yes. All of the oxygen
in the water was disintegrated.

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:24.429
The organisms in the tank
died of asphyxiation.

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:27.806
Their remains were liquified
by my Oxygen Destroyer.

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:32.780
Overall, it's a device that
splits oxygen atoms into fluids.

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:33.804
My...

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:44.320
I intended to devote my work to
the study of the element oxygen.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.828
But, in the course
of my research,

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:49.831
I came across
an unknown form of energy.

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:53.562
In my first experiment,

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:57.561
I discovered a powerful force
that scared me beyond words.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.768
I didn't eat
for two or three days!

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:16.623
Just a little piece of this,
dropped into the water,

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:21.322
could turn the entire Tokyo Bay
into a graveyard!

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.428
Why are you working
on such an awful project?

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:30.961
Emiko! I perform my work

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:34.965
strictly as
a research scientist!

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.978
But what if...
what if your discovery

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.810
is used
for some horrible purpose?

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:42.214
You're right.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:46.119
Used as a weapon, this would be
as powerful as a nuclear bomb.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:50.182
It could totally destroy
humankind!

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:58.123
But I believe I can find a use
for the Oxygen Destroyer

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:00.158
that will benefit society.

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.798
Until then,
I won't reveal its existence.

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:05.773
That's why I didn't say anything
to the reporter.

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:12.305
If I am forced to surrender
this device

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:14.440
in its present form...

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:18.844
I'll make sure the results
of my experiments are destroyed

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.980
in the event of my death.

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:24.080
I understand.

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:31.056
I won't tell anyone about this,
not even my own father.

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:49.783
I had to break my promise.

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:54.980
So that's it?

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.525
But, Emiko, considering
what Serizawa said,

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:02.530
and the fact that this thing
can be of help,

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:04.691
I'm sure he will forgive you
for this.

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:24.981
Hello. Welcome back.

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.484
Serizawa.

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.891
What? Oh, it's you.

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.588
I have a favor to ask you today.

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:37.656
Well, have a seat.

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.137
What do you want from me?

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.874
I want to use
the Oxygen Destroyer.

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.312
What Oxygen Destroyer?

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.872
I don't know
what you're talking about!

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.789
Serizawa,
why are you pretending?

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:08.088
Pretending?

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:13.796
Serizawa, I broke the promise
I made to you.

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:17.134
So I told him everything!

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:19.163
Please let him use the device!

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:26.911
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:36.181
Emiko wanted to help
after seeing the destruction.

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.288
Please try to forgive her.

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:45.556
Your device is our only hope!

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:51.198
Ogata, if Emiko told you
everything about my device,

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:54.106
you should know
why I can't let you use it.

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:55.734
I must refuse!

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:56.744
Serizawa!

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:57.767
No!

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.147
Why is it wrong
to use it for this?

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:01.171
Please go home!

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:03.643
Serizawa!

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:09.779
Serizawa!

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:12.927
Open the door, please! Serizawa!

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.232
Serizawa! What are you doing?!

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:19.665
Leave me alone!

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:20.929
Do you want to destroy years
of research?

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.799
Let go!

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:25.831
Stop, please!

01:17:31.146 --> 01:17:32.135
Serizawa!

01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:37.742
Ogata!

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:39.912
Ogata!

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:08.946
Ogata, forgive me.

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:13.417
If my device can serve
a good purpose,

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:16.253
I would announce it
to everyone in the world!

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:18.887
But in its current form,

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:21.259
it is just a weapon
of horrible destruction!

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:23.865
Please understand, Ogata!

01:18:30.238 --> 01:18:32.365
I understand,

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:36.844
but if we don't use your device
against Godzilla,

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.108
what are we going to do?

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:43.641
Ogata, if the Oxygen Destroyer
is used even once,

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:47.985
politicians from around
the world will see it.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:53.684
Of course, they'll want
to use it as a weapon.

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:57.358
Bombs vs. Bombs,
missiles vs. Missiles,

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:01.961
and now a new super weapon
to throw upon us all!

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:04.267
As a scientist,
no, as a human being,

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:06.206
I can't allow that to happen!

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:08.665
Am I right?

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:23.183
Well, what do we do
about the horror before us now?

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:26.456
Should we just let it happen?

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:30.261
If anyone can save us now,
Serizawa, you're the only one!

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:37.029
If... you use the device
to defeat Godzilla,

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:42.772
unless you reveal what you have
done, who will know about it?

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:46.178
Ogata, humans are weak animals.

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:49.507
Even if I burn my notes,

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:51.951
the secret will still be
in my head.

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:56.622
Until I die, how can I be sure

01:19:56.658 --> 01:20:00.958
I won't be forced by someone
to make the device again?

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.029
What am I going to do?

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:24.651
"Oh Peace, Oh Light, Return,"
the prayer for peace

01:20:24.686 --> 01:20:28.884
that took place
all over the country today.

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:32.826
Here we see the Tokyo chapter
of this event.

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:34.123
Listen to the young voices

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:36.960
as they put the strength
of their lives into their song.

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:51.575
May we live
without destruction

01:20:51.613 --> 01:21:07.086
May we look to tomorrow
with hope

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:21.976
May peace and light
return to us.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:54.791
Serizawa!

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:01.934
Ogata, you are right.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:08.344
But this will be the first
and last time

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:12.319
that I will ever allow
the Oxygen Destroyer to be used.

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:55.827
Don't cry, Emiko.

01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:00.133
This is the only way to be sure

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:02.659
that it won't fall
into the wrong hands.

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:24.919
We are getting closer
to the moment of truth.

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.324
We will soon know if Godzilla,

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:28.261
the monster
that has terrorized the world

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:31.060
will be finally buried forever
in the ocean depths.

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:33.590
At this time, Geiger-counter
readings are being used

01:24:33.635 --> 01:24:35.262
to pinpoint Godzilla's location.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:55.855
Ogata, get me a diving suit.

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:56.982
What are you saying?!

01:24:57.058 --> 01:24:59.583
You have no experience
in using a diving suit!

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:05.924
Serizawa... Ogata is right.

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:08.434
Let him do it.

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.233
Professor, this is

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:13.434
the only Oxygen Destroyer
I have!

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:17.571
To use it properly,
I have to do it underwater.

01:25:24.385 --> 01:25:27.252
All right.
We'll do it together.

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:29.654
No. I'll do this myself.

01:25:30.758 --> 01:25:32.555
You're crazy.
I won't allow someone

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:34.528
with no experience
to go down alone!

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:39.462
Hey! Get another
diving suit ready!

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:44.838
Okay? Please don't
go down alone!

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.584
Will the only Oxygen Destroyer
in the world

01:25:57.619 --> 01:25:59.484
be powerful enough
to do the job?

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:02.547
Its inventor, Dr. Serizawa,
remains silent.

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:05.684
All we can do now
is pray for its success.

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:25.601
Professor...

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:37.955
I never thought
I'd reveal it in this way.

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:47.530
I'll be praying for you.

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:59.675
All right!
You two be very careful.

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:02.410
Ogata, we're counting on you.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:03.439
Right!

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:06.813
The time has come.

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:10.517
Right now, Dr. Serizawa
is being lowered into the water.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:16.450
They've reached the bottom!

01:29:57.492 --> 01:29:58.459
Pull!

01:29:58.493 --> 01:29:59.482
Start pulling!

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:37.487
Serizawa! Serizawa!

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:38.521
Serizawa!

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:39.291
Serizawa! Serizawa!

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:43.263
What's going on?! Serizawa!

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:58.872
Ogata, it worked!

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:01.211
Both of you, be happy.

01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:05.310
Good-bye... farewell!

01:32:10.124 --> 01:32:12.217
Serizawa! Hey, bring him up!

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:14.220
Serizawa!

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:42.754
Serizawa...

01:33:55.596 --> 01:33:58.224
This exhilaration,
this jubilation, we have won!

01:33:58.265 --> 01:33:59.493
We can see that Godzilla

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.967
will never rise
from the ocean's depths again!

01:34:02.003 --> 01:34:03.493
This victory
could not be achieved

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.971
if it weren't for the young
scientist, Dr. Serizawa.

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.887
He wanted us to be happy...

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:40.903
I can't believe that Godzilla

01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:44.570
was the only surviving member
of its species...

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:54.249
But, if we keep on conducting
nuclear tests,

01:34:54.288 --> 01:35:01.387
it's possible that another
Godzilla might appear...

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:06.662
somewhere in the world, again.

01:35:19.847 --> 01:35:21.075
Salute!

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:30.550
At ease!
