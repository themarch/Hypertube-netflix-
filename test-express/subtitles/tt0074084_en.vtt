WEBVTT

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.793
We would like to thank the citizens of Emilia
for their participation in this film.

00:03:55.876 --> 00:03:58.959
They have made an invaluable
contribution to the picture

00:03:59.043 --> 00:04:02.918
by sharing with us their experiences
and rich cultural heritage.

00:04:55.043 --> 00:04:57.043
The war is-- is over.

00:05:20.793 --> 00:05:22.293
W-- Why?

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:28.002
Hurry, comrades,
in the name of Stalin!

00:05:29.502 --> 00:05:31.502
The Black Shirt bandits are here!

00:05:32.002 --> 00:05:34.002
- Quick! Let's wipe them out!
- Come on, it's the partisans.

00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:34.967
Yeah, let's go finish them.

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:36.793
Isn't that black smoke?
Come back!

00:05:36.828 --> 00:05:38.127
Every last one of them.

00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:46.293
Grab these. Go, go on.

00:05:47.293 --> 00:05:49.168
I want a gun, too.

00:06:06.752 --> 00:06:08.252
What are you doing?
Let go.

00:06:08.287 --> 00:06:09.252
I want a gun, too.

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:12.252
Come on. I was good enough
to cut the telephone lines,

00:06:12.287 --> 00:06:13.752
so I'm good enough to carry a gun.

00:06:13.787 --> 00:06:15.769
Come on, Wildcat.
Come on.

00:06:15.804 --> 00:06:17.752
Give me one. You promised.

00:06:17.787 --> 00:06:18.585
Wildcat!

00:06:19.043 --> 00:06:20.918
Leonito, what are you waiting for?

00:06:22.335 --> 00:06:24.835
Take this. The magazine, too.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.300
Here.

00:06:26.335 --> 00:06:28.168
- Where are you going?
- I want to kill, too.

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:08.085
<i>...the commander of the
Matteotti Partisan Brigade</i>

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.050
<i>for the liberation of Italy.</i>

00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:13.585
<i>Within the last few minutes,
we have seized a radio station in Milan.</i>

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.085
<i>The city has been liberated!</i>

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:19.050
<i>And, at last, a free Milan
salutes its fellow countrymen.</i>

00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:23.085
<i>I repeat, this is the commander
of the Matteotti Partisan Brigade</i>

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.550
<i>for the liberation of Italy.</i>

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:27.585
<i>In the excitement and joy
of this memorable moment,</i>

00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:30.043
<i>our thoughts must go
to those who gave their lives</i>

00:07:30.543 --> 00:07:32.543
<i>to bring an end
to the enslavement of Italy</i>

00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:35.252
<i>at the hands of the Nazi Fascist
barbarian regime.</i>

00:07:35.752 --> 00:07:38.002
<i>But our thoughts, above all,
go to our brother partisans</i>

00:07:38.037 --> 00:07:40.502
- <i>who fought so bravely...</i>
- Leonito,

00:07:40.537 --> 00:07:42.467
what are you doing in here?

00:07:42.502 --> 00:07:45.085
- <i>...and sacrificed even their lives.</i>
- I didn't even see you.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.502
Leonito, what is all this nonsense?

00:07:47.537 --> 00:07:48.293
Give me that gun.

00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:51.127
Let go!

00:07:52.627 --> 00:07:54.592
Long live, Stalin.

00:07:54.627 --> 00:07:55.877
Have you gone out of your mind?

00:07:57.918 --> 00:08:00.918
<i>...commander of the Matteotti
Partisan Brigade for Italian liberation.</i>

00:08:00.953 --> 00:08:03.310
<i>Fascism has left us
an inheritance of misery,</i>

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:05.668
- <i>humiliation, and death.</i>
- Long live Stalin.

00:08:08.835 --> 00:08:10.335
Attila and Regina.

00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:14.835
Attila and Regina!

00:10:02.793 --> 00:10:05.127
Shoot, Attila!
Shoot!

00:10:08.835 --> 00:10:10.092
Kill her!

00:10:10.127 --> 00:10:12.092
- Bitch!
- Dirty Cossack!

00:10:12.127 --> 00:10:14.127
- Kill her!
- I'll murder you.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.710
Regina!

00:10:20.877 --> 00:10:22.710
Regina!

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.460
Attila!

00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:33.960
I'm coming!

00:10:33.995 --> 00:10:35.793
I'm coming!

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.710
Come on. Come on.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.418
Oh, the swallows are back.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.210
Wait, wait.

00:11:27.002 --> 00:11:29.002
My grandfather died here.

00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:34.252
Stand up!

00:11:52.085 --> 00:11:53.543
Sit down.

00:11:55.543 --> 00:11:56.543
Sit!

00:12:11.668 --> 00:12:15.835
Did you know that in America
every cow has its own drinking trough?

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.835
American cows are lucky.
They're well off.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.960
Hey,

00:12:22.793 --> 00:12:25.252
wouldn't you like to go
to America, Leonito?

00:12:25.287 --> 00:12:26.710
Call me Olmo.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.460
I thought your name was Leonito.

00:12:31.495 --> 00:12:33.706
Olmo's my partisan name.

00:12:33.741 --> 00:12:35.918
Do you know who Olmo was?

00:12:36.418 --> 00:12:37.835
I know he was the bravest.

00:12:39.335 --> 00:12:40.835
The bravest.

00:12:44.335 --> 00:12:46.439
Well, my little partisan friend,

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.543
what do you think of your master?

00:12:48.578 --> 00:12:50.460
There are no more masters!

00:12:51.636 --> 00:12:54.093
Verdi is dead!

00:12:57.793 --> 00:13:00.293
Verdi is dead!

00:13:05.293 --> 00:13:08.293
Giuseppe Verdi is dead!

00:13:51.127 --> 00:13:53.127
Push! Push!

00:13:53.162 --> 00:13:54.592
Push! Push!

00:13:54.627 --> 00:13:56.731
Push! Push! Push!

00:13:58.773 --> 00:14:00.675
It's born! It's born!

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.168
Look what a nice baby I made.

00:14:09.085 --> 00:14:10.050
Keep going.

00:14:10.085 --> 00:14:12.085
Come on. It's coming.

00:14:18.085 --> 00:14:21.127
Rosalba, the door.
Close the door, Rosalba.

00:14:21.162 --> 00:14:23.168
Shh, be quiet, children.
Hush up.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.710
It's a boy!

00:14:26.745 --> 00:14:28.175
It's a boy!

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.710
It's another mouth to feed.

00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:31.710
Rosina had a boy!

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.710
Another little ass to clean.

00:14:33.745 --> 00:14:35.175
It's a boy!

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.210
Don't touch him, Rigoletto,
he'll get a hump on his back.

00:14:39.283 --> 00:14:40.252
She had a boy!

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.460
It's a boy!

00:14:53.495 --> 00:14:54.425
A boy!

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.960
We have another boy!

00:14:56.995 --> 00:14:58.335
Damned woman.

00:15:07.585 --> 00:15:09.550
You hear that,
you good for nothing?

00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:13.085
The bastard's born
before the master's son!

00:15:13.585 --> 00:15:15.585
I'm going to get a stick
and come up there.

00:15:24.377 --> 00:15:26.981
Eleonora, push. It's coming.

00:15:27.016 --> 00:15:29.585
I can feel it coming. Push!

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.002
Go on, harder! Push!

00:15:34.127 --> 00:15:35.092
Go!

00:15:37.918 --> 00:15:39.127
Bitch.

00:15:42.252 --> 00:15:43.502
Papa!

00:15:44.537 --> 00:15:45.752
Papa!

00:15:58.918 --> 00:16:00.918
Alfredo is born!

00:16:00.953 --> 00:16:02.383
Alfredo!

00:16:02.418 --> 00:16:03.918
The same name as mine.

00:16:05.418 --> 00:16:07.918
And if it's a girl, huh?

00:16:08.418 --> 00:16:10.508
It's not a girl, is it?

00:16:10.543 --> 00:16:14.543
Papa, I think I can tell
a boy from a girl.

00:16:14.578 --> 00:16:15.967
He's got all the right things.

00:16:16.002 --> 00:16:19.002
He's got his father's expression already.

00:16:19.037 --> 00:16:22.002
And his grandfather's money already.

00:16:22.037 --> 00:16:24.894
Oh, what a pretty little boy.

00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:27.752
Giovanni, Giovanni.
Giovanni!

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:29.217
What is it?

00:16:29.252 --> 00:16:31.217
- How is the mother?
- Just fine.

00:16:31.252 --> 00:16:33.210
- Give her a kiss for me.
- "May the fruit of this union,

00:16:33.245 --> 00:16:35.210
"by heaven blessed,

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.960
"plucked from the Garden of Eden

00:16:39.995 --> 00:16:43.710
"be the heir to the lordly graces,

00:16:43.745 --> 00:16:45.550
"the pious heart,

00:16:45.585 --> 00:16:47.085
"the virtues of the patriots--"

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.258
Oh, shut up!

00:16:48.293 --> 00:16:49.960
Giovanni.

00:16:49.995 --> 00:16:51.300
Yes, Papa.

00:16:51.335 --> 00:16:52.752
Write to that playboy brother of yours.

00:16:53.252 --> 00:16:54.752
Write as I say.

00:16:55.252 --> 00:16:56.252
Yes, Papa.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.425
Ottavio--

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.508
Why don't you have
anything to write with?

00:17:01.543 --> 00:17:05.814
Ottavio Berlinghieri,
Hotel Des Bains, Lido, Venice.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:10.085
Announce birth, first Berlinghieri,
20th century. Stop!

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.752
Pray God he doesn't grow up
like you. Stop.

00:17:14.252 --> 00:17:16.883
Found wife yet? Question mark.

00:17:16.918 --> 00:17:18.877
Affectionately, Papa.
Have you got that?

00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:21.127
- Of course, Papa.
- Good.

00:17:39.377 --> 00:17:40.342
Sister Desolata.

00:17:40.377 --> 00:17:42.377
Sister Desolata is here!

00:17:45.377 --> 00:17:46.842
Dear brother.

00:17:46.877 --> 00:17:48.668
It's a boy, a boy.

00:17:48.703 --> 00:17:51.467
Bravo! Bravo!

00:17:51.502 --> 00:17:53.467
You can take down the trunks

00:17:53.502 --> 00:17:57.793
because I shall never again
return to that nunnery.

00:17:57.828 --> 00:17:59.758
The <i>monsignor</i> has turned very cruel.

00:17:59.793 --> 00:18:01.793
He prefers the novices,
and he neglects me.

00:18:01.828 --> 00:18:03.258
He does.

00:18:03.293 --> 00:18:05.758
And I can't tell you
how lowbred they are.

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:08.793
Listen, listen to this.
Just the other day, I--

00:18:08.828 --> 00:18:10.758
Rigoletto, my hat.

00:18:10.793 --> 00:18:13.293
- Alfredo.
- Yes, <i>Signor Padrone.</i>

00:18:16.293 --> 00:18:18.043
The Lord be with you.

00:18:18.078 --> 00:18:19.758
And with your spirit.

00:18:19.793 --> 00:18:22.293
A priest here, too.
It's a conspiracy, I tell you.

00:18:35.918 --> 00:18:38.217
Well, humpback.

00:18:38.252 --> 00:18:40.252
What do you see in there, eh?

00:18:41.668 --> 00:18:44.168
Snow. It's covered with snow.

00:18:44.203 --> 00:18:46.008
Like in winter.

00:18:46.043 --> 00:18:48.605
- What else?
- Huh? A church.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.168
A cathedral with spires.

00:18:51.203 --> 00:18:52.877
And what else?

00:18:52.912 --> 00:18:54.168
Bottles.

00:18:54.585 --> 00:18:56.001
Bottles?

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:57.383
Bottles!

00:19:05.418 --> 00:19:07.383
It's like paradise in there.

00:19:07.418 --> 00:19:09.918
And you're the <i>padrone,</i>
the lord, the master.

00:19:09.953 --> 00:19:13.418
And I'd be Saint Peter,
if you'd give me the keys.

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:39.842
Stop, no more work today.

00:19:39.877 --> 00:19:41.377
Thanks, <i>padrone.</i>

00:19:41.877 --> 00:19:43.127
Hey, thanks.

00:19:43.162 --> 00:19:44.342
Stop! Stop!

00:19:44.377 --> 00:19:46.377
Hey, drink up, drink up.

00:19:49.877 --> 00:19:51.342
For you. Stop. No work today.

00:19:51.377 --> 00:19:52.377
Today, you're the <i>padrone,</i> too.

00:19:52.412 --> 00:19:54.877
Penzo, special wine.

00:19:54.912 --> 00:19:56.342
Celebration.

00:19:56.377 --> 00:19:58.127
<i>Salute, padrone.</i>

00:19:58.162 --> 00:19:59.842
Where's, uh, Dalco?

00:19:59.877 --> 00:20:01.877
Leo's in the vineyard.

00:20:01.912 --> 00:20:03.894
That's the last bottle.

00:20:03.929 --> 00:20:05.877
Wine from the city.

00:20:05.912 --> 00:20:08.508
What about mine?

00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:09.543
It says "sparkling champagne."

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.627
Hey, Libero, what's this for,
a wedding or a funeral?

00:20:16.127 --> 00:20:18.377
There, in the vineyard.

00:20:35.752 --> 00:20:37.217
Destiny.

00:20:37.252 --> 00:20:39.217
Both born on the same day.

00:20:39.252 --> 00:20:41.752
And destiny calls for a drink, right?

00:20:43.752 --> 00:20:47.252
<i>Signor</i> Alfredo, you know
how many of us Dalcos there are now?

00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:48.752
I've lost count.

00:20:49.252 --> 00:20:50.752
Well, I know that
when we sit down to eat,

00:20:50.787 --> 00:20:53.269
there are 40 of us at the table.

00:20:53.304 --> 00:20:55.717
You're a lucky man, Leo.
Admit it.

00:20:55.752 --> 00:20:59.252
He may be a bastard,
but at least he's a boy.

00:20:59.287 --> 00:21:01.543
Don't boys eat like everybody else?

00:21:04.877 --> 00:21:06.877
What the hell is bothering you?

00:21:12.377 --> 00:21:14.133
Mine was born first.
It's only natural.

00:21:14.168 --> 00:21:17.168
First came the peasants of this world,
and then came the <i>padrone.</i>

00:21:17.203 --> 00:21:19.925
Masters, peasants. Balls!

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.960
When you're born,
you're all born equal.

00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:23.460
All equal, huh?

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:27.418
You!

00:21:28.793 --> 00:21:31.002
What are you standing there for?
Drink up.

00:21:31.037 --> 00:21:33.043
Drink up, you bastards!

00:22:13.543 --> 00:22:14.877
Drink with me.

00:22:28.502 --> 00:22:30.002
Are we drinking or not?

00:22:32.502 --> 00:22:35.002
Born together.
Must mean something.

00:22:35.037 --> 00:22:36.502
Uh-huh.

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:41.835
Probably means we die together.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.710
You shit-pile philosopher.

00:22:51.418 --> 00:22:53.418
I want mine to study law.

00:22:54.793 --> 00:22:56.758
Mine thieving.

00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:59.085
You might as well make him a priest.

00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:09.585
Oh, this wine's not ours.
Too dry.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.585
I didn't like it, either.

00:23:15.252 --> 00:23:17.752
Rigoletto, run down to the town hall.

00:23:17.787 --> 00:23:20.627
Tell them the boy's name is Alfredo.

00:23:20.662 --> 00:23:22.717
Berlinghieri, Alfredo,

00:23:22.752 --> 00:23:25.752
born of Giovanni and Eleonora Rossetti.

00:23:33.627 --> 00:23:34.960
Leo,

00:23:35.877 --> 00:23:37.627
what will you call yours?

00:23:37.662 --> 00:23:39.008
Huh?

00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:41.460
What are you going to call yours?

00:23:47.085 --> 00:23:47.960
Olmo.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.460
Olmo.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.752
Like an elm tree.

00:23:54.252 --> 00:23:56.918
Born of the late Oscar and Rosina Campo.

00:24:00.418 --> 00:24:02.133
Oscar?

00:24:02.168 --> 00:24:04.342
Oscar's been dead for four years.

00:24:04.377 --> 00:24:07.377
That's the point.
Have some respect for the dead.

00:24:08.877 --> 00:24:10.377
Oh, you bastards.

00:24:13.377 --> 00:24:16.127
<i>In the deep of the summer</i>

00:24:16.162 --> 00:24:18.842
<i>In a heat that was stifling</i>

00:24:18.877 --> 00:24:22.377
<i>There were born two male children</i>

00:24:22.412 --> 00:24:24.644
<i>The distance was trifling</i>

00:24:24.679 --> 00:24:26.877
Rigoletto, here, have a drink.

00:24:29.877 --> 00:24:31.377
Jackasses!

00:24:33.877 --> 00:24:37.231
<i>With the Pope as a peasant</i>

00:24:37.266 --> 00:24:40.675
<i>Linked by fate in that hour</i>

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.897
<i>To the</i> padrone's <i>grandson</i>

00:24:43.932 --> 00:24:47.085
<i>Heir to riches and power</i>

00:24:53.043 --> 00:24:54.543
What do you think, huh?

00:25:11.793 --> 00:25:15.293
Leo. Leo, come on.
You must try it, too.

00:25:15.793 --> 00:25:18.793
I'm not climbing on that red devil.

00:25:18.828 --> 00:25:20.810
I can't tell who rakes faster,

00:25:20.845 --> 00:25:22.569
a man with a horse and a machine

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:24.258
or a man with heart and muscle.

00:25:24.293 --> 00:25:25.758
Orso! Orso, come and see it!

00:25:25.793 --> 00:25:27.293
- Go a little faster!
- We'll soon be able to tell.

00:25:27.328 --> 00:25:28.758
There.

00:25:28.793 --> 00:25:29.793
What? What is it?

00:25:32.828 --> 00:25:33.793
There.

00:25:37.793 --> 00:25:39.050
What's written there?

00:25:39.085 --> 00:25:41.460
What do you think of that?
Half an acre in, uh,

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.925
10 minutes, all alone.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.460
It would have taken six men
at least half a day.

00:25:47.495 --> 00:25:49.425
What about this?

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.460
Surely you can't call this
a good job, eh, <i>Signor</i> Giovanni?

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.460
Look at all the hay it leaves behind.

00:25:56.495 --> 00:25:58.460
A little hay is nothing, huh?

00:25:58.495 --> 00:25:59.925
You don't agree, huh?

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.925
Don't you realize, you dumb ox,

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.425
that this is an imported
piece of machinery,

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.877
and we're the first in the whole valley
to have a mechanical hay-raker?

00:26:07.912 --> 00:26:10.342
Well, then blessed
are the last to have one.

00:26:10.377 --> 00:26:12.877
Who needs a machine that looks
like a hyena, <i>Signor</i> Giovanni?

00:27:03.085 --> 00:27:04.258
Nineteen!

00:27:04.293 --> 00:27:06.585
They stink, and besides,
you're disgusting.

00:27:38.418 --> 00:27:40.752
Hey! Twenty!

00:27:41.002 --> 00:27:42.508
Twenty!

00:27:45.002 --> 00:27:47.377
You haven't seen anything yet.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.210
Here, kiss it. Bite it.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:57.710
- Eat it.
- Jump in the lake.

00:27:59.752 --> 00:28:01.918
<i>Olmo, the bastard</i>

00:28:02.418 --> 00:28:03.752
<i>Olmo, the bastard</i>

00:28:04.752 --> 00:28:06.731
<i>Olmo, the bastard</i>

00:28:06.766 --> 00:28:08.710
<i>Olmo, the bastard</i>

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.133
<i>Olmo, the--</i>

00:28:15.168 --> 00:28:17.210
Here, eat it, and burn in hell.

00:28:19.127 --> 00:28:20.252
Coward!

00:28:21.418 --> 00:28:23.418
Go ahead!
Run, you yellow-belly!

00:28:23.918 --> 00:28:27.210
You're the yellow-belly.
You pick on girls and babies.

00:28:27.245 --> 00:28:29.460
I say you can't even last
at follow the leader.

00:28:29.495 --> 00:28:31.394
And I say I can, too.

00:28:31.429 --> 00:28:33.293
Go piss in your pocket!

00:28:36.877 --> 00:28:38.877
I'll fix you.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:39.960
What are you doing?

00:29:40.543 --> 00:29:42.127
Screwing the earth.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.425
Now what are you doing?

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.793
Listening to my father speak to me.

00:30:13.293 --> 00:30:15.335
In the telegraph pole?

00:30:25.335 --> 00:30:26.835
I can't hear anything.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.425
Are you crazy?

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.335
We'll see who's brave
and who's yellow.

00:30:46.752 --> 00:30:49.752
When it starts to go over,
shut your eyes,

00:30:49.787 --> 00:30:51.252
or it will blind you.

00:30:52.252 --> 00:30:54.252
I'll make sure you don't run away.

00:30:54.287 --> 00:30:57.217
No, no! Let me go!
Let me go!

00:30:57.252 --> 00:31:00.252
You see? You're yellow!
You're a coward!

00:31:01.252 --> 00:31:03.252
Olmo! Olmo!

00:31:25.752 --> 00:31:26.918
Olmo!

00:31:28.835 --> 00:31:30.668
Are you dead or alive?

00:31:32.168 --> 00:31:34.043
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

00:31:34.543 --> 00:31:36.793
The devil cared, the <i>padrone's</i> scared.

00:31:48.668 --> 00:31:51.668
How far is it from here
to the Madonna of the Fields?

00:31:51.703 --> 00:31:55.168
As far as it's always been,
about 3 kilometers.

00:31:55.203 --> 00:31:56.633
Once I saw a train

00:31:56.668 --> 00:31:59.633
as long as from here
to the Madonna's shrine.

00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:02.460
I got a train in my pants
that's longer than that!

00:32:02.495 --> 00:32:04.460
Listen, he's only bragging.

00:32:06.502 --> 00:32:09.918
Talk about trains.
You see that contraption outside?

00:32:09.953 --> 00:32:13.335
You don't want to use it
because you are ignorant, afraid.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.300
You're an enemy of progress,
that's what you are.

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:21.835
With that contraption, I work less,
and that's fine with me.

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.335
Well, who pays for it, huh?
Who pays for it?

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:26.925
The <i>padrone,</i> who else?

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.460
Everyone but the <i>padrone.</i>
It's we, the workers, who pay the bill.

00:32:30.495 --> 00:32:31.925
That's what we're for.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.460
He even infected you.
Look at the bugs.

00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:37.425
Olmo gave the lice to everyone.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.543
Your son's filthy.
He should be deloused.

00:32:40.578 --> 00:32:42.043
Of course he should be deloused!

00:32:42.078 --> 00:32:43.831
Someone must help me.

00:32:43.866 --> 00:32:45.585
Your Olmo's a pig.

00:32:46.085 --> 00:32:48.710
Today your little Olmo found a live frog
and forced my little Nina to eat it.

00:32:48.745 --> 00:32:52.710
Besides, what do any of you
know about philosophy?

00:32:52.745 --> 00:32:55.675
Nothing at all, that's what.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.210
I'm the only one here
who's been to any meetings

00:32:58.245 --> 00:33:01.175
to try to create a union.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.710
Because anyone who understands
must follow those meetings,

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:09.210
and must travel around to preach
the great, new justice

00:33:09.245 --> 00:33:13.210
to the unlucky peasants
who work out their lives and sweat,

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.210
profiting not themselves,
but only the <i>padrone.</i>

00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:18.727
Amen.

00:33:20.208 --> 00:33:21.585
Look at that.

00:33:39.502 --> 00:33:40.758
Who is crying?

00:33:40.793 --> 00:33:44.168
Rosina wants to send Olmo
to the seminary.

00:33:44.203 --> 00:33:45.550
- Why?
- Why?

00:33:45.585 --> 00:33:47.585
The boy's the devil.

00:33:51.585 --> 00:33:55.085
They want to take him away from me,
my own son.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.085
Turn him into a priest.

00:33:59.085 --> 00:34:03.585
Nothing's for nothing.
You had your fun. Well, now you pay.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.085
Come on, now,
it can happen to anybody.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.585
Cut it out.

00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:10.043
It seems to me,
she's got a lot more than most.

00:34:10.078 --> 00:34:12.002
When you hatch a bastard,
he always turns out evil.

00:34:13.502 --> 00:34:15.002
Bastard?

00:34:15.502 --> 00:34:18.383
Who said, "bastard"?

00:34:18.418 --> 00:34:20.418
There are no bastards in my house.

00:34:20.453 --> 00:34:22.435
Olmo's the brother of your sons

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:24.418
because his father's one of us.

00:34:24.453 --> 00:34:26.043
Is that true or not?

00:34:26.078 --> 00:34:27.543
Hey, Rosina?

00:34:28.543 --> 00:34:31.008
Is that true or not?

00:34:31.043 --> 00:34:33.855
You tell them, Rosina.
You know.

00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:36.668
It's true.
Of course I know.

00:34:40.168 --> 00:34:41.668
If I don't, who does?

00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:48.480
Olmo!

00:34:59.127 --> 00:35:01.627
Olmo, they called you.

00:35:01.662 --> 00:35:03.127
It was Leo.

00:35:06.627 --> 00:35:08.585
Hey! Hey!

00:35:12.585 --> 00:35:14.758
Dalco, Olmo.

00:35:14.793 --> 00:35:16.293
- Where's he going?
- There he is.

00:35:16.328 --> 00:35:17.793
Come on, give him here!

00:35:17.828 --> 00:35:19.758
Let go! Let go!

00:35:19.793 --> 00:35:21.793
Get him up on the table.

00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.793
Get up there!

00:35:25.293 --> 00:35:26.793
Dalco, Olmo,

00:35:28.293 --> 00:35:29.758
now that you are grown...

00:35:29.793 --> 00:35:31.793
And still piss in your pants.

00:35:34.293 --> 00:35:35.960
Come here.

00:35:35.995 --> 00:35:37.592
Remember this.

00:35:37.627 --> 00:35:39.127
You will learn to read,

00:35:39.418 --> 00:35:41.258
you will learn to write,

00:35:41.293 --> 00:35:45.293
but you will still remain
Dalco, Olmo,

00:35:45.328 --> 00:35:47.060
son of peasants.

00:35:47.095 --> 00:35:48.793
Doomed to hunger.

00:35:50.793 --> 00:35:52.793
You will go off to the army, huh.

00:35:54.293 --> 00:35:56.758
You will see the world.

00:35:56.793 --> 00:35:58.293
You may even learn to obey.

00:35:58.793 --> 00:36:00.960
With kicks in the ass
from morning till night.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.460
You will take a wife. Huh?

00:36:04.835 --> 00:36:07.335
You will work for the lives
of your children.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.835
The best thing
is to learn to be patient.

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.668
But who will you remain always?

00:36:13.168 --> 00:36:14.508
Dalco, Olmo.

00:36:14.543 --> 00:36:17.043
And that's who you are, Olmo.

00:36:17.078 --> 00:36:18.543
A peasant!

00:36:19.543 --> 00:36:20.793
Understand?

00:36:21.293 --> 00:36:23.168
No priests in this house.

00:36:27.168 --> 00:36:28.668
What do you have in your hand?

00:36:28.703 --> 00:36:29.668
Nothing.

00:36:30.168 --> 00:36:33.168
<i>Signor</i> Giovanni gave it to me.
I sold him my frogs.

00:36:33.203 --> 00:36:34.668
It's mine.

00:36:50.668 --> 00:36:53.668
If it is yours,
then it belongs to all of us.

00:36:55.502 --> 00:36:57.002
It's too high. I'll fall.

00:36:57.502 --> 00:36:58.939
"It's too high. I'll fall."

00:36:58.974 --> 00:37:00.377
I wish you would and break your neck.

00:37:00.412 --> 00:37:03.342
You're nothing but a big sissy.

00:37:03.377 --> 00:37:07.377
Alfredo, Regina, come to dinner.

00:37:12.377 --> 00:37:17.383
A card came from my brother,
the Parisian.

00:37:17.418 --> 00:37:20.918
"Here, in the <i>ville lumière,</i>
I'm thinking of you all with affection.

00:37:20.953 --> 00:37:23.918
"Best regards as ever, Ottavio."

00:37:23.953 --> 00:37:24.918
Alfredo!

00:37:27.918 --> 00:37:29.883
Affection and best regards.

00:37:29.918 --> 00:37:31.883
He hasn't written in over a year.

00:37:31.918 --> 00:37:34.918
He doesn't feel at home here
and never has, you know that.

00:37:35.418 --> 00:37:36.918
He has nothing but contempt for us.

00:37:36.953 --> 00:37:38.418
What are you saying?
What contempt?

00:37:38.453 --> 00:37:40.383
You're always exaggerating.

00:37:40.418 --> 00:37:42.418
Ah, your brother Ottavio,
he knows how to live.

00:37:42.918 --> 00:37:45.105
Paris, Maxim's, champagne, gigolos.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.293
We sacrifice, while he devours money.

00:37:47.328 --> 00:37:48.758
His allowance is a good meal.

00:37:48.793 --> 00:37:50.293
- Got here first.
- Why do we have to keep calling you?

00:37:50.328 --> 00:37:51.793
Regina!

00:37:56.793 --> 00:37:58.793
- I'll serve.
- The frogs look juicy.

00:37:58.828 --> 00:38:00.793
Really plump.

00:38:02.293 --> 00:38:03.793
- Alfredo.
- No, no frogs.

00:38:04.293 --> 00:38:06.293
Oh, come on, don't be a baby.

00:38:11.293 --> 00:38:13.793
They're really disgusting.
Awful.

00:38:13.828 --> 00:38:15.310
Where are your manners, Alfredo?

00:38:15.345 --> 00:38:16.758
Wait till you get in the army.

00:38:16.793 --> 00:38:19.335
You'll wish you had something
as fresh and delicious as that.

00:38:19.835 --> 00:38:24.175
Bullshit.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:27.710
Oh, my brother?
Was that my brother who spoke?

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.210
Regina.

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.758
- Thank you.
- Who are those two?

00:38:38.793 --> 00:38:41.293
You ask me the same thing every evening.

00:38:41.328 --> 00:38:43.793
It's my sister
and her little girl, Regina.

00:38:45.168 --> 00:38:46.168
Oh.

00:38:49.668 --> 00:38:51.168
Alfredito,

00:38:53.168 --> 00:38:54.168
my dinner.

00:38:55.335 --> 00:38:57.335
Go, and come right back.

00:39:04.168 --> 00:39:05.293
Gets worse every day.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.668
How much longer can he last?

00:39:08.703 --> 00:39:11.133
Oh, patience, patience.

00:39:11.168 --> 00:39:14.668
He's eight years younger than me,
my brother,

00:39:14.703 --> 00:39:17.502
and you would have him dead already.

00:39:19.668 --> 00:39:21.668
Can you imagine Ottavio,
with the excuse that he's the oldest,

00:39:21.703 --> 00:39:24.633
coming here to act
as lord and master of the place?

00:39:24.668 --> 00:39:29.627
He was born with the grace of true nobility.
Well, it is the same with me.

00:39:29.662 --> 00:39:31.550
I was certainly not born a nun.

00:39:31.585 --> 00:39:33.585
I'm going to be a nun, too,
when I grow up.

00:39:50.127 --> 00:39:51.918
- Want a shot?
- Oh, yes.

00:39:56.918 --> 00:39:58.418
Hug the stock.

00:39:59.418 --> 00:40:00.918
Right elbow out.

00:40:02.418 --> 00:40:03.918
Keep both eyes open.

00:40:05.918 --> 00:40:07.418
You see that family of vultures?

00:40:07.453 --> 00:40:08.883
Yes.

00:40:08.918 --> 00:40:11.418
The old black one
with the beady eyes, hmm?

00:40:11.453 --> 00:40:12.383
Yes.

00:40:12.418 --> 00:40:14.418
That's your target.

00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:16.383
Bang. Bang.

00:40:16.418 --> 00:40:19.168
You got her. You got her!

00:40:24.918 --> 00:40:26.383
Imagine the shock.

00:40:26.418 --> 00:40:29.918
My husband goes bankrupt
and runs off to South America,

00:40:29.953 --> 00:40:33.377
leaving his wife
and little daughter penniless.

00:40:33.412 --> 00:40:34.752
If it hadn't been for all of you...

00:40:34.787 --> 00:40:36.175
Don't, Amelia.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.710
Won't I ever see my father again?

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.960
He's your new father, now.
Aren't you, Giovanni?

00:40:44.995 --> 00:40:48.852
Of course.
If I didn't support them, who would?

00:40:48.887 --> 00:40:52.710
But you. You will go on
calling me uncle. Hmm?

00:40:58.335 --> 00:40:59.800
Shh.

00:40:59.835 --> 00:41:02.335
There they are.
I'll take Regina.

00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.835
No, Regina's mine. Regina's mine.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.800
Aim, fire! Bang!

00:41:07.835 --> 00:41:09.175
Right between the eyes.

00:41:11.203 --> 00:41:13.168
And now for the jackals.

00:41:14.668 --> 00:41:16.668
Aim, fire!

00:41:18.668 --> 00:41:19.877
Well?

00:41:27.752 --> 00:41:28.752
Old fool.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:40.710
Get back to the table.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.710
Get back to the table, I said.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.710
And you. Shame on you.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.210
The table! Get going!

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:57.210
Idiot.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.210
Shame on you, at your age.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.710
There's an ocean between us.

00:42:09.745 --> 00:42:11.710
Between me and the rest of you.

00:42:11.745 --> 00:42:12.710
An ocean!

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.210
Talk, talk.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:20.675
Buy machines.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.675
The place is going to rack and ruin.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:28.127
You'll find that mechanical reaper
up your ass, Mr. Modernizer.

00:42:35.543 --> 00:42:37.043
You eat your meal.

00:42:45.627 --> 00:42:48.377
You go to hell if you don't eat.

00:42:48.412 --> 00:42:50.342
Piss in your pocket.

00:42:50.377 --> 00:42:52.335
Where did you hear talk like that?

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.835
From a friend.

00:42:55.835 --> 00:42:57.835
I mean-- I mean,
I'm not about to part with a cent,

00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:00.335
or give away the tiniest piece of land.

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:01.335
You can believe me.

00:43:01.835 --> 00:43:03.335
Big talk, my dear,
since your father prefers Ottavio.

00:43:03.835 --> 00:43:06.835
Look, I only happen to be here
because all of this estate belong to me.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.102
All of it to me!
Else, I be...

00:43:09.137 --> 00:43:11.335
You know how I feel about Ottavio?

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.835
Well, I'm envious.
Yes, dear.

00:43:17.335 --> 00:43:19.300
To be able to escape this family.

00:43:19.335 --> 00:43:22.835
Oh, just imagine how it would be
to spend all that money in six months.

00:43:23.335 --> 00:43:25.335
A millionaire surrounded with whores.

00:43:45.127 --> 00:43:47.127
An ocean of shit.

00:44:02.377 --> 00:44:03.842
Oh, really, now!

00:44:03.877 --> 00:44:06.835
What was the point in hammering
at the poor child like that?

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:10.752
I prefer educating my boy
the way I see fit.

00:44:10.787 --> 00:44:12.217
Alfredo!

00:44:12.252 --> 00:44:15.168
Don't worry. When he's hungry,
he'll come back. I assure you.

00:44:28.168 --> 00:44:31.668
These aren't lice.
They're roast chickens, that's what they are.

00:44:33.168 --> 00:44:35.168
Keep still, keep still.

00:44:44.918 --> 00:44:48.210
A little fuzz on top,
and the rest bald as a cucumber.

00:44:48.245 --> 00:44:50.210
Keep still, keep still.

00:45:02.918 --> 00:45:06.918
<i>Once a hunchback
Win a lady hunchback</i>

00:45:06.953 --> 00:45:09.418
<i>Win her with a song</i>

00:45:09.918 --> 00:45:12.918
<i>And a lot of little hunchbacks
came along</i>

00:45:12.953 --> 00:45:14.383
<i>Came along</i>

00:45:14.418 --> 00:45:16.383
I'll never return home anymore.

00:45:16.418 --> 00:45:18.918
I'm going to live with Uncle Ottavio.

00:45:18.953 --> 00:45:20.418
Alfredo!

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:24.883
Alfredo, where are you?

00:45:24.918 --> 00:45:27.418
- Evening, <i>Signor Padrone.</i>
- Good evening.

00:45:27.453 --> 00:45:29.918
Come back to the house,
you hear me?

00:45:30.418 --> 00:45:32.418
Good evening, <i>Signor</i> Giovanni.

00:45:33.918 --> 00:45:34.835
Hey, you.

00:45:39.127 --> 00:45:40.418
Have you seen Alfredo?

00:45:40.793 --> 00:45:42.085
No, I haven't.

00:45:42.585 --> 00:45:44.585
Go to bed, pumpkin head.

00:45:47.585 --> 00:45:49.085
It's late.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:01.175
Olmo.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:03.127
- Olmo.
- What is it?

00:46:03.162 --> 00:46:04.592
Come to bed.

00:46:04.627 --> 00:46:07.592
You know I can't sleep
if you don't.

00:46:07.627 --> 00:46:11.127
If my father was here,
they would never shave my head.

00:46:11.627 --> 00:46:15.092
He would've shown them.

00:46:15.127 --> 00:46:18.627
Once I heard him calling me
late at night from inside a well.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:21.092
Alfredo!

00:46:21.127 --> 00:46:23.127
Let's both of us run away.

00:46:24.627 --> 00:46:26.127
Alfredo!

00:46:28.627 --> 00:46:33.252
And I heard him once in an old squash
calling out to me. Olmo!

00:46:33.287 --> 00:46:34.252
Alfredo.

00:46:37.002 --> 00:46:40.502
And in a dark cellar, from inside the bottle,
I heard him call.

00:46:40.537 --> 00:46:42.502
Olmo!

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:46.502
- Alfredo.
- Olmo.

00:47:11.168 --> 00:47:15.133
Hey, let's see you fly,
cuckoo birds.

00:47:15.168 --> 00:47:20.168
No, don't,
you're going to make me fall.

00:47:20.203 --> 00:47:22.633
- Red, but not ripe.
- Your daughter?

00:47:22.668 --> 00:47:25.168
Your daughter's marrying Mario,
the cripple, in August, eh?

00:47:25.203 --> 00:47:28.168
- What do you think?
- What's the problem?

00:47:28.203 --> 00:47:30.168
Go and dance, eh.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:13.460
Hey.

00:48:13.495 --> 00:48:15.175
Hey, you, driver.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.675
Come back here.
Come back.

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:20.710
Don't leave that horse
standing there untied.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:23.210
Come back.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:25.210
You son of a...

00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:43.168
I don't have the breath to...

00:48:46.085 --> 00:48:47.877
give a simple order anymore.

00:48:49.918 --> 00:48:50.918
God damn it!

00:48:55.418 --> 00:48:56.918
Listen.

00:48:57.918 --> 00:48:58.918
Beautiful music.

00:49:00.418 --> 00:49:05.418
Young people dancing, embracing.

00:49:06.418 --> 00:49:09.418
Before the day's out,
they'll be fucking.

00:49:17.752 --> 00:49:20.085
Anyway, this is no place for old men.

00:50:28.377 --> 00:50:31.210
Oh, it's a hot day, eh,
<i>Signor Padrone?</i>

00:50:34.127 --> 00:50:35.717
Who are you?

00:50:35.752 --> 00:50:38.717
Sir, it's Erma.
I'm the youngest daughter of Adelina.

00:50:38.752 --> 00:50:42.210
I'm not used to wearing shoes,
and my stupid feet swelled up.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.175
But they're pretty, aren't they?

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:49.168
They're a present.
The <i>padrona,</i> she said they're Regina's.

00:50:52.168 --> 00:50:55.002
Erma, come.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.960
Erma.

00:52:34.293 --> 00:52:35.793
<i>Signor Padrone?</i>

00:52:42.752 --> 00:52:44.252
<i>Signor Padrone?</i>

00:52:57.293 --> 00:52:58.835
<i>Signor Padrone?</i>

00:53:05.252 --> 00:53:07.752
Don't be frightened.
Don't be frightened.

00:53:09.752 --> 00:53:11.752
Don't be frightened.

00:53:14.877 --> 00:53:15.877
Take it.

00:53:19.377 --> 00:53:21.835
You squeezed me, so I got scared.

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:36.835
- Milk her.
- But the cows aren't mooing yet.

00:53:37.377 --> 00:53:39.835
Can't you see how full she is?

00:53:39.877 --> 00:53:40.877
Milk her.

00:54:05.752 --> 00:54:08.252
Squish, squash.

00:54:09.752 --> 00:54:12.835
Cows full of milk and shit.

00:54:15.252 --> 00:54:17.050
A curse.

00:54:17.085 --> 00:54:19.293
A curse we carry with us.

00:54:19.328 --> 00:54:21.502
It grows worse with age.

00:54:23.502 --> 00:54:26.002
You know what the worst curse
in the world is?

00:54:27.585 --> 00:54:29.252
Hailstorms.

00:54:29.293 --> 00:54:31.022
Not hailstorms.

00:54:31.057 --> 00:54:32.752
That's no curse.

00:54:35.585 --> 00:54:38.418
Milk and shit in the brain.

00:54:43.168 --> 00:54:44.668
War and disease,

00:54:46.168 --> 00:54:48.168
they're no curse, either.

00:54:51.668 --> 00:54:53.668
Squish, squash.

00:54:55.668 --> 00:54:57.502
Squish, squash.

00:55:03.502 --> 00:55:05.918
The curse is when you can't do it.

00:55:21.835 --> 00:55:23.335
Milk and shit.

00:55:29.835 --> 00:55:31.335
Can't do it.

00:55:43.835 --> 00:55:45.335
It won't get hard.

00:55:52.835 --> 00:55:53.835
See?

00:55:54.835 --> 00:55:56.835
Put your hand inside.

00:56:06.127 --> 00:56:09.252
Hey, <i>Signor</i> Alfredo,
nobody can milk a bull.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:16.800
Go.

00:56:16.835 --> 00:56:17.835
Go back to the dance.

00:56:26.752 --> 00:56:29.168
- Can I really go?
- Uh-huh.

00:56:29.203 --> 00:56:30.502
Go. Go.

00:56:32.877 --> 00:56:33.877
Erma.

00:56:37.502 --> 00:56:39.502
When the dancing is over,

00:56:41.002 --> 00:56:42.002
tell them I'm dead.

00:56:42.418 --> 00:56:43.585
Yes, <i>signor.</i>

00:56:52.412 --> 00:56:53.502
Remember,

00:56:55.335 --> 00:56:57.335
- I'm dead.
- Yes.

00:57:22.627 --> 00:57:24.752
The <i>padrone,</i> my God.

00:57:24.787 --> 00:57:26.842
The <i>padrone</i> is dead.

00:57:26.877 --> 00:57:29.335
The <i>padrone</i> told me to say he's dead.

00:57:32.877 --> 00:57:34.258
I was supposed to.

00:57:34.293 --> 00:57:36.717
You think it could be true?

00:57:36.752 --> 00:57:40.252
Pour the water out
so we can get the nightingale drunk.

00:57:40.752 --> 00:57:42.217
Up to the top.

00:57:42.252 --> 00:57:43.717
The <i>padrone</i> wants us
to keep dancing.

00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:45.502
He's giving us orders
even after he's dead.

00:57:45.537 --> 00:57:46.918
Music!

00:58:35.043 --> 00:58:38.502
Ah, if only you could see yourself now,
<i>Signor</i> Alfredo.

00:58:43.043 --> 00:58:45.502
Oh, this is no way
for a <i>padrone</i> to die.

00:58:48.043 --> 00:58:51.502
What did you have to turn
the cows loose for, eh?

00:58:51.537 --> 00:58:53.918
So I'd have more work to do?

00:58:57.752 --> 00:58:59.633
Maybe...

00:58:59.668 --> 00:59:03.502
Maybe the truth is that
when a man does nothing all his life,

00:59:04.043 --> 00:59:06.272
it leaves him too much time to think.

00:59:06.307 --> 00:59:08.502
And thinking too much makes him...

00:59:08.537 --> 00:59:10.502
Makes him stupid.

00:59:13.043 --> 00:59:17.043
At least I knew who you were,
and you knew me.

00:59:17.078 --> 00:59:20.043
I knew who gave the orders.

00:59:20.078 --> 00:59:21.752
A big, ugly bull!

00:59:24.252 --> 00:59:27.752
But now, who knows
what will happen without you?

00:59:33.168 --> 00:59:36.668
I, Alfredo Berlinghieri,

00:59:37.668 --> 00:59:41.133
being of sound mind and body,

00:59:41.168 --> 00:59:44.168
wish to make my last will and testament.

00:59:44.668 --> 00:59:46.502
I hereby declare

00:59:47.918 --> 00:59:51.418
my younger son, Giovanni,

00:59:52.918 --> 00:59:54.585
as my sole heir.

00:59:56.085 --> 00:59:58.835
And I leave to my elder son, Ottavio...

01:00:00.168 --> 01:00:02.133
What did he say?

01:00:02.168 --> 01:00:04.668
"To my elder son, Ottavio."

01:00:09.168 --> 01:00:15.168
I leave an annuity
of 5,000 lira a year,

01:00:16.668 --> 01:00:21.668
to be paid to him for the rest
of his life by my sole heir,

01:00:21.703 --> 01:00:24.752
Giovanni Berlinghieri.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:31.856
And I also leave him
my town residence.

01:00:31.891 --> 01:00:37.502
Furthermore, it shall
hereby be understood

01:00:47.752 --> 01:00:53.002
that the entire
Berlinghieri estate consisting...

01:00:54.502 --> 01:00:56.585
Go back to bed, Alfredo.

01:00:56.627 --> 01:00:59.627
Grandfather's not well.
Go back to bed.

01:01:00.627 --> 01:01:02.627
Consisting of...

01:01:04.752 --> 01:01:07.252
the entire Berlinghieri estate...

01:01:07.752 --> 01:01:09.668
Grandpa's dead!

01:01:09.703 --> 01:01:12.050
No. No. No, no!

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:14.418
- Consisting of--
- Grandpa's dead! Grandpa's dead!

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.002
900 acres of cultivated land,

01:01:17.502 --> 01:01:19.835
the family villa,

01:01:22.168 --> 01:01:23.668
the farmhouses,

01:01:30.085 --> 01:01:32.085
machinery and tools,

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.627
and all the livestock,

01:01:41.085 --> 01:01:42.585
the cattle,

01:01:44.627 --> 01:01:47.627
the horses and the pigs,

01:01:49.085 --> 01:01:50.585
the sheep,

01:01:51.627 --> 01:01:55.085
I give to my son, Giovanni.

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:36.835
This turban...

01:02:38.585 --> 01:02:42.418
once belonged to a hunter of tigers.

01:02:59.043 --> 01:03:02.502
Uncle Ottavio,
let me go away with you.

01:03:03.835 --> 01:03:05.835
Why? Don't you like it here?

01:03:06.668 --> 01:03:08.002
They're all liars.

01:03:08.502 --> 01:03:09.502
Oh.

01:03:12.835 --> 01:03:14.335
And where shall we go?

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:16.002
On a sail ship.

01:03:16.043 --> 01:03:18.043
- A sail ship?
- Yes.

01:03:20.252 --> 01:03:21.752
Like this one?

01:03:51.252 --> 01:03:53.085
Put that silkworm down!

01:03:56.585 --> 01:03:58.585
- Put it down!
- Why should I?

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:01.252
Because you know
they're all in my care.

01:04:03.252 --> 01:04:06.502
But I can touch all these silkworms
as much as I please.

01:04:06.537 --> 01:04:08.002
You're stupid.

01:04:09.502 --> 01:04:10.502
No.

01:04:11.502 --> 01:04:13.133
You know, <i>padrone.</i>

01:04:13.168 --> 01:04:15.502
But the nests are mine.
Nobody's to interfere.

01:04:16.502 --> 01:04:17.300
Why not?

01:04:17.335 --> 01:04:20.585
Because I feed them, understand?
Set them down.

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.550
Only when I feel like it.

01:04:23.585 --> 01:04:26.918
Even if you feed them,
the silkworms are still all mine.

01:04:29.418 --> 01:04:30.918
And the fruit is mine, too.

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.210
And the mechanical reaper.

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:41.210
And the wheat is mine.

01:04:42.668 --> 01:04:46.918
This worm is mine.
The cows are all mine.

01:04:47.418 --> 01:04:49.668
Even the Dalco family belongs to me.

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:54.467
And you belong to me, too.

01:04:54.502 --> 01:04:56.502
You filthy maggot, let him go!

01:04:56.537 --> 01:04:57.585
No!

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:01.752
Burn in hell!
You'll burn in hell!

01:05:01.787 --> 01:05:02.668
Burn in hell!

01:05:04.752 --> 01:05:06.918
Come back here, you yellow-belly.

01:05:25.752 --> 01:05:28.835
Oh, Madonna.
Give me a hand before we both get it.

01:05:31.668 --> 01:05:34.717
Hmm, I could beat you
with one hand behind me.

01:05:34.752 --> 01:05:37.752
I'm afraid you couldn't beat a frog,
not if you tried.

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:49.217
Here, you may have
your stupid silkworm back.

01:05:49.252 --> 01:05:52.252
This one's still squirming.
The others have already woven their nests.

01:05:52.287 --> 01:05:54.168
It's not a bird, you dunce.

01:05:54.668 --> 01:05:57.918
Those are called pupae,
or cocoons if they're already formed.

01:05:57.953 --> 01:06:00.418
You better take those wet things off.

01:06:02.752 --> 01:06:04.217
Pretty light.

01:06:04.252 --> 01:06:08.002
And, look, whenever it finally flies off,
it'll be a butterfly.

01:06:11.002 --> 01:06:13.383
- I missed ever seeing them.
- Like my little sister.

01:06:13.418 --> 01:06:17.835
She hatched in the night,
and like a butterfly, just flew away.

01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:19.168
Why did she fly away?

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:21.168
She was born dead.

01:06:23.585 --> 01:06:25.585
That isn't true.
When you're dead, you're dead.

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.585
You don't fly anywhere.

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:32.085
You get buried in the ground,
and that's it.

01:06:41.585 --> 01:06:42.835
It must hurt a lot.

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:44.085
Why should it hurt?

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:46.550
Skin's all back.

01:06:46.585 --> 01:06:48.085
Let's see if yours is any different.

01:06:56.835 --> 01:06:58.800
Looks just like a cocoon.

01:06:58.835 --> 01:07:01.335
Pull the skin back
and it'll look just like mine.

01:07:03.835 --> 01:07:06.252
- It won't go.
- Well, pull harder.

01:07:06.287 --> 01:07:07.585
Oh, it burns.

01:07:08.085 --> 01:07:12.085
Ah, it burns because you're not courageous,
and you're not a socialist.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.550
What's that mean?

01:07:13.585 --> 01:07:15.918
You're talking to a socialist
with holes in his pocket.

01:07:15.953 --> 01:07:18.435
"A socialist with holes in his pocket"?

01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:20.944
Oh, forget it.
What do you know anyhow?

01:07:20.979 --> 01:07:23.418
Ah, don't be so smart,
and put this on.

01:07:24.418 --> 01:07:25.918
No, I don't want it.

01:07:25.953 --> 01:07:27.418
Don't be so childish.

01:07:41.168 --> 01:07:43.168
It stopped hailing. Listen.

01:07:46.668 --> 01:07:49.168
Look, look.
Look out of this window.

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:55.133
- What's that?
- It's the city, of course.

01:07:55.168 --> 01:07:59.335
It can't be the city.
The city's too far away.

01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:01.168
That's the city, I tell you.
Look.

01:08:01.502 --> 01:08:03.717
And there's the cathedral,
with the dome.

01:08:03.752 --> 01:08:06.502
I recognize it 'cause I've been there
with my Uncle Ottavio.

01:08:06.537 --> 01:08:10.002
And way on top,
there are all those tall houses.

01:08:10.037 --> 01:08:11.800
Those aren't houses.
They're bell towers.

01:08:11.835 --> 01:08:15.418
Look at the fire
that's pouring out of that one.

01:08:15.453 --> 01:08:17.102
That's a factory, Olmo.

01:08:17.137 --> 01:08:18.717
Do they have a view of us,

01:08:18.752 --> 01:08:20.502
just like we have a view of them,
would you say?

01:08:25.418 --> 01:08:28.383
Papa, you can see the city
from the loft,

01:08:28.418 --> 01:08:29.918
and we could see the buildings
and the stables.

01:08:30.418 --> 01:08:32.883
- Not now. Later.
- Ah, <i>Signor</i> Giovanni.

01:08:32.918 --> 01:08:36.918
Not since the year I was married
have I seen a hailstorm such as this.

01:08:37.918 --> 01:08:40.418
Get all your people here.

01:08:40.453 --> 01:08:42.883
The day laborers, too.

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:45.418
I'll be waiting in the field.

01:08:46.418 --> 01:08:48.918
Hey, Orso!

01:08:48.953 --> 01:08:49.883
Orso!

01:08:49.918 --> 01:08:51.918
- Turo!
- Turo!

01:08:51.953 --> 01:08:53.935
- Penzo!
- Penzo!

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:55.944
- Oreste!
- Oreste!

01:08:55.979 --> 01:08:57.918
- Amoretto!
- Amoretto!

01:08:57.953 --> 01:08:59.383
- Ganco!
- Ganco!

01:08:59.418 --> 01:09:01.418
- Reccione!
- Reccione!

01:09:01.453 --> 01:09:03.383
- Montanaro!
- Montanaro!

01:09:03.418 --> 01:09:05.668
Everybody!
Everybody in the field!

01:09:30.002 --> 01:09:32.502
Now, let's face facts, men.

01:09:32.537 --> 01:09:34.967
We lost everything.

01:09:35.002 --> 01:09:39.002
Wine, tomatoes, potatoes, corn,
everything.

01:09:39.502 --> 01:09:42.252
So now, we'll have to make
some kind of sacrifice.

01:09:46.752 --> 01:09:48.085
Isn't that so, Leo?

01:09:52.585 --> 01:09:56.085
What's happened?
Lost your tongue, have you?

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.085
Go ahead, tell them.

01:09:57.585 --> 01:09:59.085
How much grain have we lost?
Tell them.

01:10:02.585 --> 01:10:03.550
Half.

01:10:03.585 --> 01:10:05.585
- Ah, half, you say.
- Uh-huh.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.050
So, it's simple.

01:10:07.085 --> 01:10:09.085
We'll have to be satisfied
with half pay.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.050
Take it or leave it.

01:10:11.085 --> 01:10:14.085
When we harvest double,
we don't get double pay.

01:10:15.585 --> 01:10:16.585
If I were to be honest...

01:10:18.168 --> 01:10:21.251
If I were to look
after my interests alone,

01:10:21.286 --> 01:10:24.335
I shouldn't need you,
fire the lot of you,

01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:26.752
especially all you day laborers.

01:10:28.168 --> 01:10:30.668
And if you here weren't
such an ignorant bunch,

01:10:31.168 --> 01:10:32.133
you would thank me,

01:10:32.168 --> 01:10:35.668
because the one making
the biggest sacrifice is me.

01:10:40.168 --> 01:10:41.633
What's the problem, anyway?

01:10:41.668 --> 01:10:45.085
Who gives the orders here?
Who's the <i>padrone?</i>

01:10:46.085 --> 01:10:47.085
Hey, you!

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:59.418
We've lost nearly everything,
didn't you hear?

01:10:59.918 --> 01:11:02.668
And yet, your ears are both big enough.

01:11:28.085 --> 01:11:31.585
<i>Padrone,</i> what you're doing is a sin,
and we'll remember it.

01:11:31.835 --> 01:11:34.585
Your father was good.
He never did us evil.

01:11:35.085 --> 01:11:37.217
You are an evil man.
You bring sorrow to us.

01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:40.252
That man has lost his ear,
but you have lost your soul.

01:11:40.287 --> 01:11:41.717
I leave you with a curse,

01:11:41.752 --> 01:11:43.752
a curse no priest can ever lift,

01:11:43.787 --> 01:11:45.752
to rule by the new <i>padrone.</i>

01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:56.418
It's food. Everyone into the house.

01:12:28.168 --> 01:12:29.668
Were you hurt bad?

01:12:32.168 --> 01:12:33.168
No.

01:12:36.502 --> 01:12:38.502
An accident, my own fault.

01:12:38.537 --> 01:12:40.252
Poor Vittorio.

01:12:56.585 --> 01:12:58.918
Papa, there's no more polenta.

01:13:03.835 --> 01:13:06.633
Papa, I'm still hungry.

01:13:06.668 --> 01:13:09.668
You will forget about hunger
if you listen to me.

01:13:40.335 --> 01:13:42.800
Water!

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.835
Let the water through.

01:13:47.502 --> 01:13:49.002
Let the water through.

01:13:57.168 --> 01:13:58.668
It's the beginning.

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:01.168
- What of?
- Workers' leave.

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:02.668
What did they say?

01:14:02.703 --> 01:14:04.633
To move on.

01:14:04.668 --> 01:14:06.168
Call the strike for tomorrow.

01:14:06.203 --> 01:14:07.810
You're going to go?

01:14:07.845 --> 01:14:09.418
Everybody's got to go.

01:14:20.168 --> 01:14:24.633
Uh, well, what's going on here?

01:14:24.668 --> 01:14:27.668
We're striking, that's what.
Everybody's agreed.

01:14:28.668 --> 01:14:29.668
Striking?

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:35.168
You know what that means, strike?

01:14:38.668 --> 01:14:40.668
I said, do you know
what that means?

01:14:43.668 --> 01:14:46.752
That means these hands
won't work anymore, huh.

01:14:47.252 --> 01:14:48.585
They won't reap anymore.

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:52.085
Never harvest anymore.

01:14:53.585 --> 01:14:55.585
Never, never, never, never milk.

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:58.085
Never dig anymore.

01:14:58.585 --> 01:15:00.585
Everything comes to a standstill.

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:04.585
And the land... the land dies.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:08.085
Do you really think
you can go through with this?

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.918
Yes. Now we got the League.

01:15:10.418 --> 01:15:11.418
The League?

01:15:14.418 --> 01:15:16.418
What is this League?

01:15:18.418 --> 01:15:21.217
Does the League tell you that--

01:15:21.252 --> 01:15:25.252
that we'll end up
eating the grass from these ditches, eh?

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:29.085
That we'll become evil,
really evil?

01:15:31.002 --> 01:15:33.043
The League tell you all this?

01:15:33.078 --> 01:15:35.085
It did.
The League understands.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.550
The League is for us.

01:15:36.585 --> 01:15:40.585
You can fight back with the League,
and I'll show you how.

01:15:41.585 --> 01:15:44.050
The strike is on!

01:15:44.085 --> 01:15:46.585
- The strike is on!
- The strike is on!

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.050
Strike!

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:52.085
- The strike is on!
- The strike is on!

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.550
- The strike is on!
- The strike is on!

01:15:54.585 --> 01:15:57.085
- The strike is on!
- The strike is on!

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.585
- Strike!
- Strike!

01:15:59.585 --> 01:16:01.585
You know I like this song.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.585
The strike is on!

01:16:04.085 --> 01:16:05.050
- Strike!
- Strike!

01:16:05.085 --> 01:16:07.085
- Strike is on!
- Strike!

01:16:08.502 --> 01:16:10.252
- Strike.
- Strike!

01:16:10.287 --> 01:16:12.144
The strike is on!

01:16:12.179 --> 01:16:14.002
- Strike!
- Strike!

01:16:47.168 --> 01:16:50.293
They should milk the poor things.
They're mooing.

01:16:50.328 --> 01:16:53.748
I hear them.
The strike paralyzing the servants, too?

01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:57.168
Dear Zolina, send a boy out
to buy some milk in town.

01:16:57.203 --> 01:16:59.668
Tell him if he sees a Dalco
to move along.

01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:01.002
Don't talk to those people.

01:17:02.502 --> 01:17:03.967
It's absolutely ridiculous.

01:17:04.002 --> 01:17:08.002
Over 100 cows in the barn
and we have to buy milk.

01:17:08.502 --> 01:17:11.668
Those bastards are absolutely
going to ruin me!

01:17:11.703 --> 01:17:13.335
It's against the law.

01:17:14.835 --> 01:17:17.168
What they're doing out there
is uncivilized.

01:17:17.203 --> 01:17:20.002
And I can't beat any sense into them.

01:17:20.037 --> 01:17:22.967
Not even with old Leo.

01:17:23.002 --> 01:17:26.002
Sooner or later
they'll have to give in. Mmm.

01:17:26.037 --> 01:17:28.002
Meanwhile the cows
are full to bursting,

01:17:28.037 --> 01:17:30.002
and the grain rots in the field.

01:17:32.502 --> 01:17:33.418
Why don't you eat?

01:17:38.835 --> 01:17:39.800
Listen to this.

01:17:39.835 --> 01:17:41.300
"Talks between the Labor League

01:17:41.335 --> 01:17:44.800
"and the Landowner's Association
have been broken off.

01:17:44.835 --> 01:17:47.835
"The strike area is patrolled,
day and night, by a cavalry regiment.

01:17:48.335 --> 01:17:50.335
"'We will not be coerced,'
said the association's representative..."

01:17:50.835 --> 01:17:52.300
Stop that.

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:54.217
"'by a league of rabble-rousers.

01:17:54.252 --> 01:17:57.835
"'We'll oppose their boycott
by imposing lockouts.

01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:00.467
"'We'll counter violence with violence.'

01:18:00.502 --> 01:18:03.502
"The speaker went on to say
that the only fair verdict is the whip,

01:18:03.537 --> 01:18:05.502
"to be used on those workers
guilty of sabotage."

01:18:10.835 --> 01:18:12.835
Grandfather, what are scabs?

01:18:13.335 --> 01:18:17.835
Uh, scabs are lousy bastards
who work when other men are on strike.

01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:19.668
Why don't they want to strike, too?

01:18:19.703 --> 01:18:21.467
Because they're ignorant.

01:18:21.502 --> 01:18:23.002
They're even more ignorant
than we are.

01:18:24.887 --> 01:18:26.668
Listen, listen.
Hear the music.

01:18:44.418 --> 01:18:45.918
Of course.

01:18:46.918 --> 01:18:48.085
Good day, padre.

01:18:50.085 --> 01:18:52.800
Hey, look over there.

01:18:52.835 --> 01:18:56.252
Look at <i>Signor</i> Giovanni
trotting up and down.

01:18:56.752 --> 01:19:00.168
Oh, there's Passetti.
He has to work sitting down.

01:19:00.668 --> 01:19:03.502
And over there, that's Carbonini.

01:19:03.668 --> 01:19:05.133
He's the lawyer.

01:19:05.168 --> 01:19:08.418
And the girl with the long braids,
that's his daughter.

01:19:08.453 --> 01:19:09.883
Are they all scabs?

01:19:09.918 --> 01:19:11.752
No, no. Landowners.

01:19:13.668 --> 01:19:15.133
<i>How funny they look</i>

01:19:15.168 --> 01:19:18.168
<i>Din-dong, ding-dong, ding...</i>

01:19:35.835 --> 01:19:37.335
Olmo.

01:19:38.168 --> 01:19:39.668
Olmo, come here.

01:19:45.668 --> 01:19:48.668
Can this be what they call socialism?

01:19:49.168 --> 01:19:51.168
All the rich out there sweating

01:19:52.168 --> 01:19:55.168
and the poor folks lying under a tree,

01:19:55.203 --> 01:19:57.185
flat on our backs?

01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.168
It's too good to last.

01:20:01.085 --> 01:20:02.918
You're a lucky boy, you are, Olmo.

01:20:03.918 --> 01:20:05.585
- Why?
- Why?

01:20:08.085 --> 01:20:11.585
It took me 73 years
to see a landlord working.

01:20:20.085 --> 01:20:23.085
That's right.
You finish setting the traps.

01:20:29.585 --> 01:20:31.585
Hey, Olmo.

01:20:34.585 --> 01:20:38.585
Fetch some leaves.
Make a little breeze.

01:20:47.585 --> 01:20:49.585
I always loved the wind.

01:21:06.502 --> 01:21:09.335
I would like to learn
how to make a trap like that.

01:21:09.668 --> 01:21:11.668
Shh. Grandfather's dozing.

01:21:17.168 --> 01:21:20.335
Olmo, does your grandfather
always go to sleep with his eyes open?

01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:23.335
He could do anything.
He once even saw Garibaldi.

01:21:26.252 --> 01:21:28.752
Better look out. If they see us together,
you're going to get it.

01:21:28.787 --> 01:21:30.717
No.

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:34.252
Anyway, everyone knows
I'm a socialist, too, now.

01:21:34.287 --> 01:21:36.752
Hey, come here.
I'll show you something.

01:21:37.752 --> 01:21:40.217
It's like yours now.

01:21:40.252 --> 01:21:43.752
- How'd you do it?
- Easy. I yanked it back.

01:21:43.787 --> 01:21:45.769
You big liar.
You went like this...

01:21:45.804 --> 01:21:47.752
Look, I'll teach you something.

01:21:47.787 --> 01:21:49.217
I know.

01:21:49.252 --> 01:21:50.717
I know how you do it.

01:21:50.752 --> 01:21:53.252
I'm a socialist with holes
in the pocket, too.

01:22:18.002 --> 01:22:20.502
Hey, Fasuline,
what's that cloud of dust want from us?

01:22:20.537 --> 01:22:21.883
You dumbbell, that's no cloud.

01:22:21.918 --> 01:22:23.418
They're kids that come from the farm.

01:22:23.453 --> 01:22:24.883
What did they come for?

01:22:24.918 --> 01:22:26.918
They came to Genoa,
same as we did.

01:22:26.953 --> 01:22:28.918
Oh, for the onion season.

01:22:28.953 --> 01:22:30.883
No, ignoramus.

01:22:30.918 --> 01:22:33.883
They were invited
by the backwaters in Genoa,

01:22:33.918 --> 01:22:37.418
because after three months of striking,
there's nothing left to eat.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:40.918
And so the Workers' League
chartered a train for Genoa.

01:22:40.953 --> 01:22:42.883
Long live the kids from the farm!

01:22:42.918 --> 01:22:45.918
Long live Genoa!
Long live the children!

01:22:50.002 --> 01:22:51.967
Well, Zambrone, what do you think?

01:22:52.002 --> 01:22:55.418
If I have to think, Fasuline,
I'll need my thinking cap.

01:22:55.453 --> 01:22:58.835
Didn't you hear? The reformists
want to give 10 pennies more an hour.

01:22:58.870 --> 01:23:00.717
- More per hour?
- Yeah.

01:23:00.752 --> 01:23:03.918
Well, let's see now,
10 pennies more an hour

01:23:03.953 --> 01:23:06.633
multiplied by 18 hours work a day.

01:23:06.668 --> 01:23:09.335
Oh! We'll be millionaires
by nightfall.

01:23:09.370 --> 01:23:11.835
Go jump in the lake, bubblehead.

01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:12.800
Hey!

01:23:12.835 --> 01:23:15.668
That wasn't nice.
Now I get water in the ear.

01:23:17.252 --> 01:23:21.168
Listen, Zambrone, on the other hand,
the revolutionaries say

01:23:21.203 --> 01:23:24.335
that the land should go
to those who work it, you hear,

01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:27.002
and eliminate owners and slaves alike.

01:23:27.037 --> 01:23:29.217
You get the gist, young man?

01:23:29.252 --> 01:23:31.710
I got it. I got it.
I read and write, you know.

01:23:31.745 --> 01:23:34.168
I'm a scholar
and I practice my pinctuation.

01:23:34.668 --> 01:23:36.668
Punctuation!

01:23:38.168 --> 01:23:40.168
Let's check the vacobulary.

01:23:40.203 --> 01:23:41.918
Vocabulary.

01:23:41.953 --> 01:23:42.918
Well, what do you think?

01:23:42.953 --> 01:23:44.418
I think it's time.

01:23:44.918 --> 01:23:45.883
Time? For what?

01:23:45.918 --> 01:23:50.168
The time has come to say,
long live the revolution!

01:23:50.203 --> 01:23:51.133
Hurray!

01:23:51.168 --> 01:23:54.252
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

01:23:54.287 --> 01:23:56.633
Hurray!

01:23:56.668 --> 01:23:59.800
- Long live the strike!
- Hurray for the strike!

01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:03.585
Long live the Workers' League.
Long live the strike.

01:24:13.502 --> 01:24:17.127
Oh, Zambrone, look who's come.
Look. I see guards, policemen.

01:24:17.162 --> 01:24:20.873
Oh, Fasu, what will we do?
What will we ever do?

01:24:20.908 --> 01:24:24.585
Listen, we can give them a lesson,
but we need a stick.

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:26.467
Quick, quick.
Grab a stick.

01:24:26.502 --> 01:24:29.835
Ready, Zambrone?
Now let's hear what they got to say.

01:24:30.335 --> 01:24:33.467
Hey! Who dares defy the law? Aha!

01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:37.418
Caught red-handed.
Drop that stick and come here quick.

01:24:37.453 --> 01:24:38.883
Traitor!

01:24:38.918 --> 01:24:40.918
All right! That's enough!
Out! All of you, out!

01:24:40.953 --> 01:24:41.668
Out!

01:24:42.168 --> 01:24:44.002
Come on!
Move it out of here!

01:24:59.168 --> 01:25:02.585
Hurry, the train. Go.
Go on, children. Hurry.

01:25:12.335 --> 01:25:13.800
Ashamed!

01:25:13.835 --> 01:25:16.585
You ought to be ashamed!
You even pick on puppets!

01:25:19.585 --> 01:25:23.085
You cowards!
Go back to the landowners!

01:25:35.835 --> 01:25:37.668
Get down off those horses!

01:25:37.703 --> 01:25:40.633
You cowards! Traitors!

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:43.668
You sold out to the landowners!
Renegades!

01:25:44.168 --> 01:25:45.668
Drop dead all of you!

01:25:47.502 --> 01:25:49.133
Olmo.

01:25:49.168 --> 01:25:51.835
Olmo, you forgot your clothes!

01:25:52.335 --> 01:25:54.335
Long live the great agricultural strike

01:25:54.835 --> 01:25:55.835
June 1908

01:26:21.668 --> 01:26:23.168
Olmo!

01:26:25.252 --> 01:26:28.217
Olmo! Olmo, where are you?

01:26:28.252 --> 01:26:32.252
Olmo, you forgot the bundle
with your clothes and things.

01:26:32.287 --> 01:26:35.133
Olmo! Olmo!

01:27:09.002 --> 01:27:11.668
You thought I was a coward, Olmo.

01:27:11.703 --> 01:27:13.168
I'm not a coward.

01:27:14.502 --> 01:27:16.835
Over there.
I can see my house.

01:27:25.668 --> 01:27:28.668
Look, look, the church steeple.

01:29:01.918 --> 01:29:03.918
- Hey, Aranzini.
- Huh?

01:29:03.953 --> 01:29:06.435
I dreamt of your sweetheart again.

01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:08.883
She had tits dripping with honey.

01:29:08.918 --> 01:29:12.002
I had a dream of your sister.
She'll do it with any man.

01:29:17.502 --> 01:29:18.967
This one's leg is turning blue.

01:29:19.002 --> 01:29:21.502
- Call the sergeant! Call the sergeant!
- Not the sergeant.

01:29:21.537 --> 01:29:23.502
Get a doctor over here.

01:29:29.002 --> 01:29:31.002
Move along! Move along!

01:29:52.252 --> 01:29:53.717
Look at them, men.

01:29:53.752 --> 01:29:57.252
Filthy strikers and traitors,
a disgrace to the country.

01:29:57.287 --> 01:30:00.085
Have a good look
at those subversive swine.

01:30:05.418 --> 01:30:07.918
Turo! Turo!

01:30:07.953 --> 01:30:10.383
Olmo! Olmo!

01:30:10.418 --> 01:30:13.383
The bastards got you.

01:30:13.418 --> 01:30:15.751
The country is in the hands of murderers.

01:30:15.786 --> 01:30:18.085
- Quiet!
- God damn the whole nation!

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:20.085
God damn the King!

01:30:21.085 --> 01:30:23.550
Olmo! Olmo!

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:25.918
- Olmo!
- Quiet!

01:31:03.252 --> 01:31:04.252
It's you.

01:31:35.585 --> 01:31:38.085
- Regina!
- Huh?

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.644
Go away!

01:31:39.679 --> 01:31:41.133
Go away!

01:31:41.168 --> 01:31:43.668
The masquerade's over.
Take that costume off. The war has ended.

01:31:43.703 --> 01:31:44.633
Yes, Lieutenant.

01:31:44.668 --> 01:31:46.668
I said, out, out, out!

01:31:47.668 --> 01:31:49.418
And close the door, Regina!

01:31:49.453 --> 01:31:51.168
Close the door!

01:32:03.252 --> 01:32:05.002
Will you look at that?

01:32:05.037 --> 01:32:06.585
Vincenzo!

01:32:12.835 --> 01:32:14.460
Oh, back!

01:32:17.835 --> 01:32:19.085
Almeida.

01:33:03.585 --> 01:33:05.835
"'Please, Father,'
said the young prince.

01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:08.085
"'I can't tell why,
but my heart will not be at rest

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.852
"'till I find the
three nectarines of love.

01:33:10.887 --> 01:33:13.550
"'I beg you, let me go search for them.'

01:33:13.585 --> 01:33:16.918
"The boy's plea was so sincere
that his majesty promised

01:33:16.953 --> 01:33:20.633
"that the moment spring came--"

01:33:20.668 --> 01:33:24.168
What happened?
Aren't you going to read anymore?

01:33:58.502 --> 01:34:00.502
I think I heard the story before.

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:02.502
You must be Olmo.

01:34:02.537 --> 01:34:03.502
Yes.

01:34:05.002 --> 01:34:06.502
And you?

01:34:07.002 --> 01:34:09.502
Anita. Anita Forlan.

01:34:11.002 --> 01:34:13.002
You're from the north?

01:34:14.502 --> 01:34:16.002
Province of Verona.

01:34:16.037 --> 01:34:17.002
Verona?

01:34:18.502 --> 01:34:20.502
We camped near Verona.

01:34:20.537 --> 01:34:22.502
- Are you a refugee?
- Yes.

01:34:24.502 --> 01:34:26.002
I lost all my family.

01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:33.668
Go on.

01:34:35.168 --> 01:34:37.002
It's heavy, huh?

01:34:38.418 --> 01:34:40.918
Aren't you going
to tell us how it ends?

01:34:40.953 --> 01:34:42.418
Does he find the nectarines?

01:34:42.453 --> 01:34:43.383
Tell us, Anita.

01:34:43.418 --> 01:34:44.918
All right. Be good.

01:34:46.918 --> 01:34:49.168
"The boy's plea was so sincere..."

01:34:55.585 --> 01:34:56.550
Attention!

01:34:56.585 --> 01:34:58.668
At your order, sir.

01:34:58.703 --> 01:34:59.668
At ease.

01:35:06.585 --> 01:35:09.460
Hey, soldier, don't you recognize me?

01:35:09.495 --> 01:35:12.335
It's me, you stupid jackass.
It's me.

01:35:37.502 --> 01:35:42.050
I don't want you.
You're a lowly civilian.

01:35:42.085 --> 01:35:45.668
The war is over.
Nobody gives us orders anymore.

01:35:55.918 --> 01:35:56.918
Now, I like you better.

01:35:56.953 --> 01:35:58.383
Hey.

01:35:58.418 --> 01:36:00.918
"Oh, kiss me, my hero."

01:36:16.418 --> 01:36:19.418
There was no one to take care
of the silkworms anymore.

01:36:19.453 --> 01:36:21.752
There's nothing up here
but rats now.

01:36:27.668 --> 01:36:29.668
Like in the trenches.

01:36:40.418 --> 01:36:43.668
Hey, remember when no one believed
you could see the city up here?

01:36:43.703 --> 01:36:45.668
But we managed to see it from here.

01:36:46.168 --> 01:36:49.633
How close it seemed, huh?

01:36:49.668 --> 01:36:52.168
Did you manage to see
the whole war from here, too?

01:37:10.002 --> 01:37:13.383
Dreamed all the night
in the barracks bed

01:37:13.418 --> 01:37:16.918
of his sister, his brother,
his father, his mother.

01:37:16.953 --> 01:37:20.418
Next morning, in the barracks bed,
they found him dead.

01:37:20.453 --> 01:37:21.918
They found him dead.

01:37:33.918 --> 01:37:35.383
No, Olmo, no!

01:37:35.418 --> 01:37:37.668
Our part in it is finished.
Done.

01:37:37.703 --> 01:37:39.918
Don't we share half and half anymore?

01:37:40.418 --> 01:37:41.883
Try to understand, Olmo.

01:37:41.918 --> 01:37:44.418
You've been away, and there are
a lot of new things you don't know.

01:37:44.453 --> 01:37:46.418
I know we always get
half the harvest.

01:37:46.668 --> 01:37:47.467
Not this year, though.

01:37:47.502 --> 01:37:49.668
They rented new machines
and hired extra labor.

01:37:51.418 --> 01:37:53.002
- This is no time--
- Let go.

01:37:56.002 --> 01:37:58.133
Long live our hero.

01:37:58.168 --> 01:38:01.668
Even sharing half and half is robbery
since we do all of the work.

01:38:01.703 --> 01:38:04.133
And now not even that.

01:38:04.168 --> 01:38:06.668
You know why I have
to hire these hands?

01:38:07.168 --> 01:38:09.168
Because almost all of you men

01:38:09.203 --> 01:38:11.168
got yourselves killed in the war

01:38:11.668 --> 01:38:13.133
like idiots.

01:38:13.168 --> 01:38:15.633
Papa, what's wrong with you?

01:38:15.668 --> 01:38:18.168
Papa, you have no right
to say something like that.

01:38:18.203 --> 01:38:21.185
You keep quiet.
And play soldier if you like.

01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:24.168
Do you know how much I spent
to keep you at home?

01:38:24.668 --> 01:38:27.168
No, I don't know.
How much did you spend?

01:38:28.168 --> 01:38:30.133
More than you're worth.

01:38:30.168 --> 01:38:32.668
Well, you know, I wanted to go.
You didn't want me to go.

01:38:32.703 --> 01:38:34.133
Oh, of course.

01:38:34.168 --> 01:38:37.168
Well, what a handsome saber you have.

01:38:38.668 --> 01:38:42.002
Yes, this is a handsome saber.
Very handsome.

01:38:42.037 --> 01:38:45.002
And it cuts well!
It cuts very well!

01:38:46.002 --> 01:38:47.502
Watch, Papa! Watch!

01:38:49.252 --> 01:38:51.085
Bravo, Lieutenant.

01:38:52.585 --> 01:38:56.585
So, that is what you're good at?

01:38:59.252 --> 01:39:02.752
At your age, I used to get up
at 4:00 in the morning to check the stable.

01:39:03.752 --> 01:39:05.752
Everyone here remembers that.

01:39:07.252 --> 01:39:10.002
And at threshing time,
I was the first to be up

01:39:10.037 --> 01:39:12.300
and the last to go to bed.

01:39:12.335 --> 01:39:14.633
Isn't that so?
Can anybody deny that?

01:39:14.668 --> 01:39:18.335
Go ahead! Go ahead! Speak up!
Isn't that so? I know it is.

01:39:18.835 --> 01:39:20.835
Bravo, my little cousin.

01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:21.835
Thank you.

01:39:22.335 --> 01:39:24.460
The next time you'll be pierced.

01:39:24.495 --> 01:39:26.585
I sacrifice for this farm.

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.550
Sacrifice.

01:39:28.585 --> 01:39:32.585
There aren't any ideals anymore.
No respectability.

01:39:33.085 --> 01:39:35.876
Devotion to the church,
love for the land,

01:39:35.911 --> 01:39:38.664
loyalty to the family,
and credit in the bank.

01:39:38.699 --> 01:39:41.418
Come on, Uncle.
You're getting upset. Don't.

01:39:41.668 --> 01:39:43.300
And respect.

01:39:43.335 --> 01:39:46.168
Respect! Respect! Respect!

01:39:46.502 --> 01:39:48.883
What the <i>padrone</i> meant

01:39:48.918 --> 01:39:52.418
was that because there was
no one here to work,

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:54.918
he had to buy modern machines.

01:39:55.918 --> 01:39:58.383
Machines are like peasants.

01:39:58.418 --> 01:40:00.918
They need their share of grain, too.

01:40:02.585 --> 01:40:05.168
But they make life easy.

01:40:06.252 --> 01:40:07.752
It's a change,

01:40:09.168 --> 01:40:10.668
but it's progress.

01:40:11.168 --> 01:40:12.002
Look.

01:40:13.335 --> 01:40:14.585
Beautiful.

01:40:22.085 --> 01:40:23.085
Heavy?

01:40:45.335 --> 01:40:48.126
Hey! Hey! Stop that!

01:40:48.161 --> 01:40:50.918
Are you crazy? Hey!

01:40:53.252 --> 01:40:54.383
- Hey!
- No, wait.

01:40:54.418 --> 01:40:55.418
Why would you do
a thing like that?

01:40:55.453 --> 01:40:57.383
The army teach you nothing?

01:40:57.418 --> 01:40:59.418
- Who's this?
- This is-- This is Attila Mellanchini.

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:01.060
My father's new foreman.

01:41:01.095 --> 01:41:02.668
I'm a soldier like you.

01:41:04.585 --> 01:41:07.085
Hey, you heard what the <i>padrone</i> said.

01:41:07.585 --> 01:41:09.085
You've had your share of grain.

01:41:10.085 --> 01:41:12.085
He gives you all he can.

01:41:13.585 --> 01:41:15.460
We'll work together.

01:41:15.495 --> 01:41:17.335
Hey, I understand you.

01:41:30.168 --> 01:41:32.085
Olmo. Olmo.

01:41:33.085 --> 01:41:34.085
Olmo.

01:41:37.502 --> 01:41:41.252
Did you hear, women,
what our <i>padrone</i> had to say?

01:41:41.287 --> 01:41:42.717
It's our men's fault

01:41:42.752 --> 01:41:45.502
because they got themselves
killed in the war.

01:41:45.537 --> 01:41:46.502
And the fault of the day laborers

01:41:47.002 --> 01:41:49.002
because they work like beasts all day

01:41:49.037 --> 01:41:51.002
and then expect to be paid for it.

01:41:51.502 --> 01:41:53.502
It's all our fault
that our families go hungry,

01:41:54.002 --> 01:41:55.967
and that half of us end up
sick with goiter trouble,

01:41:56.002 --> 01:41:59.668
and it's always our fault
when so many of our children are born dead.

01:42:00.168 --> 01:42:02.883
Come, follow me, women.

01:42:02.918 --> 01:42:07.085
The master should be really content
if we take only a little grain

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.585
and leave him the rest.
For the moment.

01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:11.752
Come on, women, come on.

01:42:19.335 --> 01:42:21.335
You speak too well
for a little country girl.

01:42:21.370 --> 01:42:23.300
I'm a schoolteacher.

01:42:23.335 --> 01:42:27.168
That was the first time
I ever kissed a schoolteacher.

01:42:27.203 --> 01:42:29.168
Hey, schoolteacher,

01:42:31.668 --> 01:42:33.668
finish the lesson.

01:42:33.703 --> 01:42:35.133
Ah!

01:42:35.168 --> 01:42:37.668
Look, women, our rooster is crowing.

01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:41.835
Here, peck. Eat. Go on.

01:42:46.502 --> 01:42:47.800
Oh!

01:42:47.835 --> 01:42:50.383
Very funny. All right.

01:43:16.502 --> 01:43:19.293
What's the matter?
Why are you leaving?

01:43:19.328 --> 01:43:22.085
To find another place
to work and die.

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.085
Who put you out?

01:43:23.502 --> 01:43:27.168
Ah, who can put you out?
Landowners.

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:29.668
Even though our contract
hasn't run out,

01:43:29.703 --> 01:43:31.185
they're giving us the boot.

01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:32.777
We formed the Workers' League.

01:43:32.812 --> 01:43:34.300
They're making us pay the price.

01:43:34.335 --> 01:43:36.835
And if you saw how our <i>padrone</i>
took advantage. It was a shame.

01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:39.335
We have to put up with the <i>padrone</i>
fooling with our women.

01:43:41.335 --> 01:43:43.752
You say we'll find work near Mantua?

01:43:55.002 --> 01:43:57.002
Let's go.
No sense in fighting, Oreste.

01:43:57.502 --> 01:43:59.300
Not when you haven't a chance.

01:43:59.335 --> 01:44:00.800
But our contract hasn't run out yet.

01:44:00.835 --> 01:44:02.835
If they don't mean
to pay us for our work,

01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:04.418
then still I'll stay
on this soil.

01:44:04.453 --> 01:44:05.918
By Christ!

01:44:08.918 --> 01:44:11.418
Oreste!

01:44:12.418 --> 01:44:14.918
Oreste!

01:44:15.918 --> 01:44:18.418
Oreste!

01:44:26.418 --> 01:44:30.918
Run away, Oreste!

01:44:31.418 --> 01:44:35.418
The demons are coming on horseback

01:44:35.453 --> 01:44:37.918
to carry you off!

01:44:38.918 --> 01:44:41.918
Run away, Oreste!

01:44:50.418 --> 01:44:53.418
Not even the Pope,
not even Jesus, the Lord,

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:54.883
is going to make me budge my ass!

01:44:54.918 --> 01:44:57.918
Because I gave 40 years of my life
to this valley.

01:44:57.953 --> 01:44:59.418
Enough of your kind!

01:44:59.453 --> 01:45:01.383
Lousy bastards,

01:45:01.418 --> 01:45:03.418
you're afraid 'cause you know
that you're getting away with murder.

01:45:03.453 --> 01:45:05.918
New laws are what we need,
and a new government,

01:45:05.953 --> 01:45:07.883
so injustice comes to an end.

01:45:07.918 --> 01:45:09.918
Laws that are going
to get rid of all these delinquents.

01:45:09.953 --> 01:45:11.435
- Oreste!
- Laws!

01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:12.883
Papa, stop!

01:45:12.918 --> 01:45:13.918
Good laws that will
give us all a voice...

01:45:14.418 --> 01:45:15.418
You're out of your mind!
Oreste!

01:45:15.918 --> 01:45:17.793
so we are heard.
Because we know how things stand.

01:45:17.828 --> 01:45:19.668
Because those who till the soil
are more intelligent

01:45:19.703 --> 01:45:21.085
than those with nothing to do.

01:45:21.585 --> 01:45:23.050
The poor peasants
can't go on like this.

01:45:23.085 --> 01:45:25.085
- Enough, Oreste! Come back!
- You want to strip us.

01:45:25.585 --> 01:45:28.668
You want to bleed us.
Well, I'll go naked to Rome.

01:45:28.703 --> 01:45:31.752
They'll here me talk.
I'll go in my underwear.

01:45:31.787 --> 01:45:34.335
- You Judas bastards.
- Oreste, stop! Stop!

01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:35.967
- Let me go!
- No!

01:45:36.002 --> 01:45:38.335
Oh, no!
Let me go! Let me go!

01:45:38.370 --> 01:45:40.300
No! Let me go!

01:45:40.335 --> 01:45:42.335
Look what you've done, you cowards!

01:45:42.370 --> 01:45:44.352
Go to work!
Bend your backs!

01:45:44.387 --> 01:45:47.027
Go to work!
You know what that means?

01:45:47.062 --> 01:45:49.668
You miserable, lowly sons of bitches!

01:46:53.335 --> 01:46:54.800
About time they arrived.

01:46:54.835 --> 01:46:57.335
They'll get those jackasses
to lift their hooves.

01:47:20.168 --> 01:47:24.668
You make me come.
Oh, you make me come.

01:47:26.168 --> 01:47:27.668
You make me come.

01:47:27.703 --> 01:47:29.168
You can't come.

01:47:30.668 --> 01:47:33.668
Come on, an elephant
couldn't make you come.

01:47:35.668 --> 01:47:38.502
All I need is a real man!

01:48:21.668 --> 01:48:24.668
In the name of the law, disperse.

01:48:26.668 --> 01:48:28.668
Where will my family sleep tonight?

01:48:29.168 --> 01:48:30.717
By the roadside?

01:48:30.752 --> 01:48:33.217
They will sleep in a jail
if you don't disperse.

01:48:33.252 --> 01:48:36.752
Put the landowners in jail
for not respecting their contract.

01:48:37.085 --> 01:48:39.668
- In the name of the--
- Law! Law! What law?

01:48:39.703 --> 01:48:41.133
Contract's our law,

01:48:41.168 --> 01:48:43.633
and their contract
still has one year to go.

01:48:43.668 --> 01:48:46.585
The <i>padrone</i> want to do them
out of a whole year's work!

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.800
The <i>padrone</i> are thieves!

01:48:48.835 --> 01:48:51.335
They want us out of the way
because we're socialists.

01:48:51.370 --> 01:48:53.835
- We want our rights.
- Then what are you waiting for?

01:48:54.335 --> 01:48:57.543
Women, get down, you hear me?
All of you. We need everybody.

01:48:57.578 --> 01:49:00.752
Get down, all of you.
Don't give up now. Don't give up, women.

01:49:01.252 --> 01:49:03.217
They don't respect the law.

01:49:03.252 --> 01:49:05.752
The <i>padrone</i> make the law
and break the law!

01:49:06.252 --> 01:49:08.752
A law for thieves and murderers!

01:49:10.335 --> 01:49:13.835
Don't go away!
Stop! Don't be afraid!

01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:17.335
Stop! Get down!
We can't let them pass!

01:49:18.335 --> 01:49:19.835
Come with us tonight!

01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:22.800
Stop! Wait!

01:49:22.835 --> 01:49:26.835
They're taking Oreste away!
Stick up for your rights!

01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:28.602
You've got to help him!

01:49:28.637 --> 01:49:30.300
- Get down!
- Get down!

01:49:30.335 --> 01:49:32.585
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Get down, get down!

01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:34.585
Left turn. Forward.

01:49:38.918 --> 01:49:41.918
Close formation!
Double up column!

01:49:43.418 --> 01:49:44.883
Aranzini.

01:49:44.918 --> 01:49:47.418
Now the royal guards
can take care of providing

01:49:47.453 --> 01:49:49.918
a nice harvest holiday for them.

01:50:03.002 --> 01:50:05.002
Unsheathe sabers!

01:50:08.668 --> 01:50:11.668
Let's get some sticks!
Come on, we have to fight them!

01:50:11.703 --> 01:50:13.602
Let's go! Let's go!

01:50:22.668 --> 01:50:24.668
Now is the time.
We'll show them.

01:51:04.002 --> 01:51:06.168
You'll have to kill us all!

01:51:07.918 --> 01:51:09.835
You won't pass here!

01:52:03.085 --> 01:52:05.217
Go, men, go on!
Teach them a lesson!

01:52:05.252 --> 01:52:07.502
Tell them to go find
their own property to huddle on!

01:52:07.537 --> 01:52:09.002
The property is inviolable!

01:52:11.002 --> 01:52:13.502
<i>Halt!</i> Squad, <i>halt!</i>

01:52:20.002 --> 01:52:22.502
Go on back! Move out!

01:52:23.002 --> 01:52:24.335
Move out!

01:52:39.918 --> 01:52:41.835
Ha! Congratulations.

01:52:42.335 --> 01:52:44.217
Afraid of peasants?

01:52:44.252 --> 01:52:46.085
You're to protect us?
What a joke!

01:52:49.085 --> 01:52:51.752
Religious cowards!
You're a disgrace!

01:53:05.252 --> 01:53:06.883
- I'll drive you off myself!
- Stop it.

01:53:06.918 --> 01:53:09.967
- Criminals! Bolsheviks!
- What are you doing?

01:53:10.002 --> 01:53:14.418
What are you doing, you fool?
You're starting a one-man war.

01:53:18.752 --> 01:53:20.252
Damn you!

01:53:22.252 --> 01:53:23.252
Go!

01:53:29.252 --> 01:53:30.717
Go on. Go on.

01:53:30.752 --> 01:53:32.752
- You look fine. They must see you.
- No, I'm not dressed right.

01:53:32.787 --> 01:53:35.252
- It's not the way to start.
- They must get to know you.

01:53:35.287 --> 01:53:39.002
Your time has come.
This is your chance. Go on.

01:53:53.752 --> 01:53:56.752
We can't do what the fascists
did at Rivarolo.

01:53:56.787 --> 01:53:59.168
One of the reds there was murdered,

01:53:59.203 --> 01:54:01.133
and so now he's their martyr,

01:54:01.168 --> 01:54:03.668
and they're giving him
a monument in the piazza.

01:54:04.168 --> 01:54:05.002
I say what we should do--

01:54:05.037 --> 01:54:06.967
Forget it, Pioppi.

01:54:07.002 --> 01:54:10.168
You don't make deals
when you've got all the trumps.

01:54:10.203 --> 01:54:12.769
They made a mistake at Rivarolo,
let me tell you.

01:54:12.804 --> 01:54:15.335
They made only one martyr,
that was their mistake.

01:54:17.085 --> 01:54:19.085
It's the same with my dog.
If you hit him once, nothing.

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:22.227
Hit him again, still nothing.
On the 10th crack, though,

01:54:22.262 --> 01:54:25.335
he does learn to obey
with his tail between his legs.

01:54:26.335 --> 01:54:27.585
May I speak, please?

01:54:39.502 --> 01:54:41.002
Here, in church,

01:54:42.002 --> 01:54:44.002
they baptized us,

01:54:44.037 --> 01:54:46.002
they confirmed us.

01:54:48.168 --> 01:54:50.335
Here in church, we were married.

01:54:50.370 --> 01:54:51.835
And one day,

01:54:52.918 --> 01:54:54.418
they will carry us in...

01:54:55.418 --> 01:54:56.918
through that door...

01:54:58.418 --> 01:54:59.918
feet first.

01:55:02.918 --> 01:55:05.085
As late as possible, I hope.

01:55:05.585 --> 01:55:08.002
All of you know what the Crusades were.

01:55:09.418 --> 01:55:11.418
Do you know what the Crusades were?

01:55:13.918 --> 01:55:18.502
Young man, we're discussing things here
that concern you, too.

01:55:18.537 --> 01:55:21.835
You wanted me to come here,
so at least leave me alone.

01:55:24.168 --> 01:55:26.050
The church.

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:30.168
Yes, even the church,
when it was necessary,

01:55:30.203 --> 01:55:32.668
clamped down hard on its enemies.

01:55:35.668 --> 01:55:38.168
Who are these Bolsheviks, anyway?

01:55:38.203 --> 01:55:39.883
Huh?

01:55:39.918 --> 01:55:43.418
Semi-Asiatics, that's what they are.

01:55:44.918 --> 01:55:46.418
Like the Saracens,

01:55:47.585 --> 01:55:49.585
Mongol subversives.

01:55:51.585 --> 01:55:55.585
And if things go on
like this much longer,

01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:57.585
they will kill us, kill us all,

01:55:58.585 --> 01:56:00.585
and take over everything.

01:56:04.085 --> 01:56:05.585
Am I right or not?

01:56:07.335 --> 01:56:09.335
Am I right or not?

01:56:10.335 --> 01:56:11.335
Hey, Pioppi?

01:56:13.835 --> 01:56:14.800
Talk, nothing but talk.

01:56:14.835 --> 01:56:17.300
I know what has to be done.
Get rid of them all.

01:56:17.335 --> 01:56:20.335
But the new fascist movement
doesn't want vengeance.

01:56:20.835 --> 01:56:24.835
We want order first.

01:56:30.335 --> 01:56:34.883
We are the new crusaders.

01:56:34.918 --> 01:56:37.585
And we must instill courage
in our youth.

01:56:38.085 --> 01:56:40.585
They're waiting for a sign from us.

01:56:48.168 --> 01:56:53.168
So let us give them this sign.

01:57:10.668 --> 01:57:12.418
Go on. Go on.

01:57:16.418 --> 01:57:18.918
We've already saved the country once.

01:57:18.953 --> 01:57:21.418
We answered the call in the trenches.

01:57:22.918 --> 01:57:24.418
And now we're here.

01:57:29.835 --> 01:57:31.550
It's only right.

01:57:31.585 --> 01:57:34.252
When you start a new enterprise,
you need a little capital.

01:57:41.502 --> 01:57:43.467
Total solidarity, eh?

01:57:43.502 --> 01:57:46.085
This is what Italy needs
to get the ball rolling.

01:59:06.418 --> 01:59:08.918
Not even a bastard
would've done this.

01:59:31.335 --> 01:59:34.383
They work hard in the city, too, huh?

01:59:34.418 --> 01:59:37.418
Imagine the look on my father's face
if he knew we were here together.

01:59:38.668 --> 01:59:42.217
Your father,
"Respect! Respect! Respect!"

01:59:42.252 --> 01:59:47.752
Your father is just a thief
who longs for respect, like all masters.

01:59:47.787 --> 01:59:49.217
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

01:59:49.252 --> 01:59:51.752
Wait till I become the master,
because I'll be twice as hard on you.

01:59:51.787 --> 01:59:53.752
And on that day, I'll kill you.

01:59:56.752 --> 01:59:58.752
No, seriously, when you see my uncle,
you'll really like him.

01:59:58.787 --> 02:00:00.217
He's much nicer than my father.

02:00:00.252 --> 02:00:02.668
He's totally different.
He's more like us.

02:00:10.168 --> 02:00:12.668
Hear that music? I know it.

02:00:43.835 --> 02:00:45.876
Montanaro! Dalco, Olmo.

02:00:45.911 --> 02:00:47.918
Don't you remember me?

02:00:51.252 --> 02:00:53.168
Oh, your foot. I'm sorry.

02:00:57.168 --> 02:00:59.918
Aren't you Olmo, the bastard child?
Really?

02:00:59.953 --> 02:01:03.060
Remember all the polenta
we used to eat?

02:01:03.095 --> 02:01:06.168
- Always polenta.
- Olmo! Olmo!

02:01:06.203 --> 02:01:08.168
Don't go. We'll talk later.

02:01:09.918 --> 02:01:11.300
We'll talk later. Don't go.

02:01:11.335 --> 02:01:13.168
Come on. Let's give this
lovely young lady a hand.

02:01:13.203 --> 02:01:15.668
Oh, uh, you don't have to bother.

02:01:15.703 --> 02:01:17.633
Alfredo, it's Montanaro.

02:01:17.668 --> 02:01:20.585
The one who cut his ear.
He's right there. See?

02:01:26.168 --> 02:01:28.668
<i>Signorina,</i> I bet you'd never guess
we're twins.

02:01:29.168 --> 02:01:31.467
Oh, you're lying.
You're making fun of me.

02:01:31.502 --> 02:01:34.252
Oh, no, that's the truth.
We share everything.

02:01:34.287 --> 02:01:36.668
What's his is mine,
and what's mine is mine.

02:01:36.703 --> 02:01:37.835
Yeah, that's about it.

02:01:41.335 --> 02:01:42.800
Good morning, <i>signora.</i>

02:01:42.835 --> 02:01:44.335
Where are you going, Nicoletta?

02:01:44.370 --> 02:01:45.835
I'm going down.

02:01:51.168 --> 02:01:53.168
- Service with a smile.
- Thank you.

02:01:53.203 --> 02:01:55.502
- Where, <i>Signorina?</i>
- On the table.

02:01:56.502 --> 02:01:58.967
Ah! Will you look at that?

02:01:59.002 --> 02:02:01.335
It's been ages since I've had
homemade liqueur.

02:02:01.835 --> 02:02:04.002
- You want some?
- Oh, yes, I would indeed,

02:02:04.037 --> 02:02:05.967
but it has to be my treat.

02:02:06.002 --> 02:02:09.002
Don't worry, I'll pay
very well for anything.

02:02:10.502 --> 02:02:13.502
I have money.
I'll pay you very well.

02:02:15.502 --> 02:02:17.467
Very well.

02:02:17.502 --> 02:02:20.085
Someday you'll choke
on your filthy money.

02:02:22.585 --> 02:02:24.335
It makes her happy.

02:02:25.835 --> 02:02:26.918
Hmm?

02:02:36.585 --> 02:02:38.876
You should have a drink, too.

02:02:38.911 --> 02:02:41.133
I better not.
It's bad for me.

02:02:41.168 --> 02:02:43.835
Then don't waste time.
Get undressed.

02:03:00.835 --> 02:03:02.300
Huh? Huh.

02:03:02.335 --> 02:03:05.335
You see?
I told you she was a whore.

02:03:05.835 --> 02:03:07.800
Didn't I?

02:03:07.835 --> 02:03:10.335
The girl is poor, but that doesn't mean
she's a slut. Does it?

02:03:10.370 --> 02:03:12.835
If she wasn't a whore,
she wouldn't take my money.

02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:14.835
But it's your money.

02:03:15.335 --> 02:03:16.800
It corrupts her.

02:03:16.835 --> 02:03:20.335
Well, anyway, she cleaned me out.

02:03:26.002 --> 02:03:28.335
Aren't you two going to get undressed?

02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:29.335
Go ahead. You go first.

02:03:29.370 --> 02:03:31.800
No, no, after you.

02:03:31.835 --> 02:03:33.960
No, no, you go.
Go ahead. I insist.

02:03:33.995 --> 02:03:36.085
No, no. You paid.
You have the right.

02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:38.352
- I'm cold.
- I'm freezing.

02:03:38.387 --> 02:03:40.585
You're older than I am.

02:03:46.085 --> 02:03:47.585
Who do you want to go first?

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:49.550
Both.

02:03:49.585 --> 02:03:52.168
You mean both of us together?

02:03:52.203 --> 02:03:54.002
Why waste time?

02:04:30.585 --> 02:04:32.550
I went under that train.

02:04:32.585 --> 02:04:35.085
- What train?
- Remember during the strike?

02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.335
I was under the train you were on.

02:04:54.335 --> 02:04:55.835
Who goes first?

02:05:28.335 --> 02:05:29.835
Your friend...

02:05:31.835 --> 02:05:34.168
Maybe you can do something better.

02:05:44.752 --> 02:05:46.752
Don't you have a girlfriend?

02:05:48.252 --> 02:05:48.952
What's so funny?

02:05:49.168 --> 02:05:51.335
I was just thinking about Anita.

02:05:51.668 --> 02:05:54.252
- Leave Anita out of this.
- Is she your girl?

02:05:54.287 --> 02:05:56.102
Come on.
Have a drink.

02:05:56.137 --> 02:05:58.027
Oh, no, no, thank you.

02:05:58.062 --> 02:05:59.883
I feel strange if I drink.

02:05:59.918 --> 02:06:02.085
But that's what's so great.
Come on.

02:06:02.585 --> 02:06:04.585
Have a drink.
Have some fun.

02:06:10.585 --> 02:06:11.918
Are you going to marry her?

02:06:12.168 --> 02:06:13.668
She's already my wife.

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:18.918
But without being married.
She's my comrade.

02:06:21.252 --> 02:06:25.168
No marriage. They're Bolsheviks.
They believe in free love.

02:06:29.335 --> 02:06:30.835
Your hand getting tired?

02:06:39.085 --> 02:06:42.002
You really know what free love is,
don't you?

02:06:43.002 --> 02:06:44.002
Hmm?

02:06:45.502 --> 02:06:46.800
Huh?

02:06:46.835 --> 02:06:48.502
Don't ask me so many questions.

02:06:48.537 --> 02:06:50.252
- Answer!
- Leave her alone.

02:06:51.752 --> 02:06:54.752
I don't know
if I'd be answering right.

02:06:56.752 --> 02:06:58.585
Don't lie to me,
you little whore.

02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:00.835
You know what free love is.

02:07:03.335 --> 02:07:04.585
I'm ashamed.

02:07:07.502 --> 02:07:09.002
I'm ashamed.

02:07:12.002 --> 02:07:13.502
Please.

02:07:15.002 --> 02:07:16.502
You must go away.

02:07:17.502 --> 02:07:18.752
Go-- Go away.

02:07:21.502 --> 02:07:22.502
Go away now.

02:07:26.252 --> 02:07:28.585
Please! Go away!

02:07:32.585 --> 02:07:35.085
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

02:07:36.585 --> 02:07:38.585
She's an epileptic.

02:07:40.085 --> 02:07:42.085
Come on, let's go.
Hurry up.

02:07:50.002 --> 02:07:52.668
Call somebody. Go on!
Call somebody!

02:07:58.418 --> 02:08:00.085
<i>Signora! Signora!</i>

02:08:01.085 --> 02:08:03.418
Stop. Please. Please.

02:08:05.418 --> 02:08:06.918
Stop! I beg you.

02:08:09.168 --> 02:08:10.085
Don't.

02:08:12.918 --> 02:08:14.168
We didn't do anything.

02:08:14.203 --> 02:08:15.252
Let her go.

02:08:17.502 --> 02:08:19.252
Stupid.

02:08:19.585 --> 02:08:21.335
She knows she must never drink.

02:08:24.252 --> 02:08:26.002
Shall I get a doctor?

02:08:26.037 --> 02:08:27.752
It wouldn't do any good.

02:08:28.252 --> 02:08:31.252
She'll stop.
Have to have patience, that's all.

02:08:35.252 --> 02:08:36.752
Alfredo.

02:09:11.502 --> 02:09:13.002
Uncle Ottavio?

02:09:14.502 --> 02:09:16.502
It's me, Alfredo.

02:09:23.002 --> 02:09:24.252
Anybody home?

02:09:30.668 --> 02:09:31.918
Hello?

02:09:31.953 --> 02:09:33.168
Who is it?

02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:38.668
I'm really very sorry.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

02:09:38.703 --> 02:09:39.633
Ottavio is not here.

02:09:39.668 --> 02:09:41.168
Ah, well, perhaps
I'll come back later.

02:09:41.668 --> 02:09:43.668
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Yes.

02:09:44.168 --> 02:09:45.633
Oh, I don't smoke.

02:09:45.668 --> 02:09:47.668
How nice.
What did you come for?

02:09:53.418 --> 02:09:54.883
Who are you?

02:09:54.918 --> 02:09:57.002
My name is Ada,
and I want a cigarette.

02:10:04.502 --> 02:10:06.752
I'm Alfredo, and I want my uncle.

02:10:07.668 --> 02:10:09.585
Have a cigar?

02:10:09.620 --> 02:10:11.467
Oh! My savior.

02:10:11.502 --> 02:10:13.502
For so little.

02:10:15.002 --> 02:10:16.002
Good afternoon, Uncle.

02:10:16.502 --> 02:10:19.252
Well, what are you doing here?

02:10:19.287 --> 02:10:21.967
Uh... Well, I had a rotten day.

02:10:22.002 --> 02:10:26.002
I came into the city to have some fun
and I saw an epileptic.

02:10:26.037 --> 02:10:28.002
Have you ever seen an epileptic?

02:10:29.502 --> 02:10:31.002
I'd like to take a bath.

02:10:31.502 --> 02:10:32.502
Of course.

02:10:39.918 --> 02:10:41.418
Mario, in here.

02:10:45.918 --> 02:10:48.252
There. Set it down there.

02:10:50.252 --> 02:10:52.002
How did the auction go?

02:10:52.037 --> 02:10:53.752
Ah, all morning a bad sale.

02:10:56.752 --> 02:11:00.502
I didn't know that the search
for pleasure could be so tiring.

02:11:00.537 --> 02:11:02.585
Oh, poor dear.
You work so hard.

02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:05.050
Uh-huh.

02:11:05.085 --> 02:11:08.668
Take a look at this.
It's exceptionally beautiful.

02:11:08.703 --> 02:11:11.185
So, naturally, no one liked it.

02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:13.668
He's a young German painter.

02:11:13.703 --> 02:11:15.418
A new discovery of mine.

02:11:33.835 --> 02:11:35.835
What do you think the man is doing?

02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:37.335
He's sleeping.

02:11:38.835 --> 02:11:41.800
No, he's dead.

02:11:41.835 --> 02:11:43.835
He's asleep, I tell you.

02:11:46.252 --> 02:11:47.752
He's dead.

02:11:48.585 --> 02:11:50.133
Look at the hand.

02:11:50.168 --> 02:11:52.752
The hand may be dead
but he's alive.

02:12:00.752 --> 02:12:01.752
- Guess what?
- Hmm.

02:12:02.252 --> 02:12:03.252
I've fallen in love.

02:12:04.418 --> 02:12:05.383
Again?

02:12:05.418 --> 02:12:06.752
But this time it's serious.

02:12:06.787 --> 02:12:07.752
Oh...

02:12:09.502 --> 02:12:11.918
Let's see if I can guess.

02:12:11.953 --> 02:12:12.883
Blanchi?

02:12:12.918 --> 02:12:14.585
- Bugatti.
- Mmm.

02:12:16.335 --> 02:12:17.717
Mmm.

02:12:17.752 --> 02:12:20.418
- The Roadster?
- No, Torpedo.

02:12:20.453 --> 02:12:21.168
Mmm.

02:12:23.585 --> 02:12:26.550
But it's an impossible love.
It's too expensive.

02:12:26.585 --> 02:12:29.085
Torpedo. Oh, I was just thinking
of buying one tomorrow.

02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.252
- Can you drive?
- Yes.

02:12:30.752 --> 02:12:32.502
I mean, no, but it's not difficult.

02:12:33.752 --> 02:12:36.752
This nephew of yours
is really a bit of a liar.

02:12:41.168 --> 02:12:43.133
Bravo. Bravo.

02:12:43.168 --> 02:12:46.752
Make that tight, stingy brother of mine
spend some of his money.

02:12:48.668 --> 02:12:50.002
How's your mother?

02:12:50.502 --> 02:12:52.002
She still paints

02:12:53.002 --> 02:12:55.002
endless ancestral landscapes.

02:12:55.502 --> 02:12:56.668
Mmm.

02:12:57.668 --> 02:12:59.668
My lost countryside.

02:13:04.835 --> 02:13:06.668
Ottavio, lend me the car.

02:13:08.668 --> 02:13:10.502
If you're ready,
I'll give you a lift home.

02:13:10.918 --> 02:13:12.252
I'm ready. Let's go.

02:13:13.252 --> 02:13:15.717
"Vroom, roar

02:13:15.752 --> 02:13:19.335
"First, second and third gears

02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:22.918
"Dry my tears and leave me cold

02:13:23.418 --> 02:13:26.418
"Bureaucratic, gray and old"

02:13:26.918 --> 02:13:28.002
You like it?

02:13:28.037 --> 02:13:29.467
Uh...

02:13:29.502 --> 02:13:32.502
Yes. It's, uh...
Yes, it's good. It's nice.

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:34.133
It's a little modern but...

02:13:34.168 --> 02:13:37.752
Modern? The hell it is.
It's futuristic.

02:13:37.787 --> 02:13:39.335
Read the other one.

02:13:41.835 --> 02:13:45.335
"Gypsy, what you rouse in me
lingers still like a kiss

02:13:45.370 --> 02:13:47.835
"and your traitorous smile."

02:13:48.668 --> 02:13:51.918
Uh, yes, it has a certain, uh...

02:13:52.418 --> 02:13:55.585
I like it. It's good.
It's too bad that it's so short.

02:13:56.418 --> 02:13:59.168
That's what's nice about it.

02:13:59.203 --> 02:14:00.717
What are you doing?

02:14:00.752 --> 02:14:03.252
Two of us have read them.
That's already too many.

02:14:03.287 --> 02:14:06.252
And you just throw them away like that?

02:14:22.502 --> 02:14:25.085
Why don't those pigs let me pass?
Bastards!

02:14:27.668 --> 02:14:29.168
I saw you.

02:14:33.453 --> 02:14:34.835
I want to pass.

02:14:37.502 --> 02:14:38.335
Come on!

02:14:38.918 --> 02:14:40.835
- What did he say?
- Go ahead. Pass them.

02:14:41.835 --> 02:14:44.668
Now, come on.
They're letting us through.

02:14:45.668 --> 02:14:46.835
Go ahead.

02:14:51.002 --> 02:14:54.002
Are they friends of yours?
They look like murderers.

02:14:54.037 --> 02:14:56.467
No, no, they're not friends of mine.

02:14:56.502 --> 02:15:00.002
I know that whenever they go out like that,
there's trouble in the making.

02:15:00.037 --> 02:15:01.967
They revolt me.

02:15:02.002 --> 02:15:05.335
I don't want to see.
I don't want to see anymore.

02:15:05.370 --> 02:15:06.883
I'm blind!

02:15:06.918 --> 02:15:09.918
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

02:15:10.418 --> 02:15:13.418
Come on, now.
Try not to go blind. Not on a curve.

02:15:15.418 --> 02:15:17.918
I don't want to see.
I don't want to see.

02:15:17.953 --> 02:15:20.002
- I'm blind! I'm blind!
- No.

02:15:20.037 --> 02:15:21.269
- Blind!
- No.

02:15:21.304 --> 02:15:22.319
- Blind!
- No.

02:15:50.668 --> 02:15:52.168
"Gives...

02:15:53.668 --> 02:15:55.168
"youth...

02:15:58.168 --> 02:15:59.668
"to mankind."

02:16:21.085 --> 02:16:23.418
Pietro, read aloud
what you've written there.

02:16:23.453 --> 02:16:27.383
"Communism gives youth to mankind."

02:16:27.418 --> 02:16:30.418
And now Olmo will explain
what that means.

02:16:36.168 --> 02:16:38.668
Well, um...

02:16:39.168 --> 02:16:41.168
What does it mean?

02:16:42.168 --> 02:16:43.668
It means...

02:16:45.002 --> 02:16:47.210
- Schoolmistress?
- Comrade.

02:16:47.245 --> 02:16:49.383
Comrade schoolmistress,

02:16:49.418 --> 02:16:52.050
I am close to 71,
and being a communist,

02:16:52.085 --> 02:16:55.418
I find I still do for a woman
more than youngsters do.

02:16:55.453 --> 02:16:57.835
You big bull,
we don't come here to be braggarts.

02:16:57.870 --> 02:17:00.002
We come here to learn.

02:17:03.668 --> 02:17:06.550
School's over for today.

02:17:06.585 --> 02:17:10.085
Go on, we'll keep an eye
on the community house. Don't worry.

02:17:10.585 --> 02:17:13.085
And we studied this whole bottle.

02:17:24.918 --> 02:17:26.418
Well, shall we go?

02:17:26.453 --> 02:17:27.883
Huh?

02:17:27.918 --> 02:17:29.418
What a rotten day.

02:17:33.418 --> 02:17:35.418
I went into town with Alfredo.

02:17:37.418 --> 02:17:39.418
- Look--
- I had no fun at all.

02:17:41.418 --> 02:17:43.418
Drawn nicely, isn't it?

02:17:46.418 --> 02:17:47.918
We walked around.

02:17:50.418 --> 02:17:52.002
Drank a little bit.

02:17:53.085 --> 02:17:54.085
You know...

02:17:55.585 --> 02:17:57.085
You know how it is in the city.

02:17:58.085 --> 02:18:00.085
I know. I know.

02:18:01.085 --> 02:18:02.085
You know.

02:18:05.585 --> 02:18:07.550
What a class.

02:18:07.585 --> 02:18:10.050
The youngest must be at least 80.

02:18:10.085 --> 02:18:13.085
The youngsters are dancing
at the Risotti barn, that's why.

02:18:20.585 --> 02:18:22.050
You're wasting your time.

02:18:22.085 --> 02:18:25.335
Giving lessons to four old men,
what good does it do?

02:18:25.370 --> 02:18:28.585
I wanted to dance, too,
but I had to wait for you! No?

02:18:35.585 --> 02:18:37.585
Dancing with that belly?

02:18:39.585 --> 02:18:42.585
Anita. Anita. Anita.

02:18:47.335 --> 02:18:48.335
No!

02:18:51.335 --> 02:18:52.835
Anita!

02:19:00.502 --> 02:19:01.967
I feel better now.

02:19:02.002 --> 02:19:04.002
Yeah, I feel better, too.

02:19:15.002 --> 02:19:16.002
Help.

02:19:18.668 --> 02:19:20.133
- Eight. Six.
- Seven. Two.

02:19:20.168 --> 02:19:22.668
- One. Eight. Nine.
- Three. Seven. Six.

02:19:22.703 --> 02:19:24.310
- Nine. Seven.
- Three. Five.

02:19:24.345 --> 02:19:25.918
- Eight. Eight.
- Six. Five.

02:19:28.668 --> 02:19:30.668
What do you have inside that head?

02:19:33.668 --> 02:19:35.168
What do you have?

02:19:56.668 --> 02:19:58.668
- You have another woman.
- No.

02:19:59.002 --> 02:20:01.002
- No?
- No, no. No.

02:20:03.085 --> 02:20:04.418
No.

02:20:11.252 --> 02:20:13.585
Come on, let's go dancing.

02:21:02.168 --> 02:21:04.168
Have you ever danced in a barn before?

02:21:04.668 --> 02:21:06.668
No, it's the first time.

02:21:09.168 --> 02:21:11.668
Wait. Wait here.
I'll go get something to drink.

02:21:12.668 --> 02:21:13.668
Wait!

02:21:26.835 --> 02:21:29.252
- Two glasses.
- Thank you. I'll pay later.

02:21:29.287 --> 02:21:30.252
Certainly.

02:21:59.168 --> 02:22:00.168
Alfredo!

02:22:03.168 --> 02:22:05.252
Alfredo, where are you?

02:22:06.835 --> 02:22:08.335
Alfredo!

02:22:10.168 --> 02:22:11.752
Don't leave me alone!

02:22:11.787 --> 02:22:12.752
Oh!

02:22:16.085 --> 02:22:17.252
Alfredo.

02:22:19.752 --> 02:22:21.002
What's wrong with her?

02:22:22.335 --> 02:22:23.800
It's nothing.

02:22:23.835 --> 02:22:26.626
I don't see. I'm blind.

02:22:26.661 --> 02:22:29.383
This music is so beautiful.

02:22:29.418 --> 02:22:32.418
Please don't stop dancing
just for me.

02:22:35.335 --> 02:22:37.835
Play on. Play on!

02:23:00.335 --> 02:23:01.752
Faster. Faster.

02:23:03.335 --> 02:23:07.085
Faster! How wonderful!

02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:08.585
Make me fly.

02:23:13.502 --> 02:23:15.918
And to think she has
such beautiful eyes, huh?

02:23:15.953 --> 02:23:17.418
Mmm, oh, yes.
Very beautiful.

02:23:29.002 --> 02:23:31.383
Alfredo, give me a kiss.

02:23:31.418 --> 02:23:33.085
Hey, look at the blind girl.

02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:35.550
Would you like a drink?

02:23:35.585 --> 02:23:37.668
No, no. I think you need a drink.
I know I need a drink,

02:23:38.168 --> 02:23:40.668
and therefore if I need a drink,
I know that you need a drink,

02:23:40.703 --> 02:23:42.168
and, therefore,
we should both have a drink.

02:23:42.203 --> 02:23:44.002
- All right?
- Yeah.

02:23:46.335 --> 02:23:48.835
- Blind, eh?
- You're not Alfredo.

02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:50.800
Who are you?

02:23:50.835 --> 02:23:53.835
How awful!
You have no pity for a blind girl.

02:23:57.335 --> 02:23:58.835
Monster!

02:24:07.752 --> 02:24:09.217
Oh!

02:24:09.252 --> 02:24:10.752
- Oh, Alfredo.
- Come on, stop this game.

02:24:11.252 --> 02:24:12.752
Pretty, isn't it?

02:24:15.168 --> 02:24:17.585
Alfredo, how could you
do that to me?

02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:20.002
You mustn't ever
leave me alone again.

02:24:20.502 --> 02:24:21.918
Oh, stop it.

02:24:23.752 --> 02:24:25.717
You're outrageous.

02:24:25.752 --> 02:24:27.752
I'm an <i>animal de luxe.</i>

02:24:29.752 --> 02:24:31.252
This is my, uh, best friend, Olmo.

02:24:31.287 --> 02:24:32.717
This is Anita. This is--

02:24:32.752 --> 02:24:36.252
Anita, this is Ada.
This is Anita. This is Ada.

02:24:43.002 --> 02:24:45.752
- It's soft.
- Imagine if we had one like this.

02:24:46.085 --> 02:24:47.835
- It's warm.
- It's warm. Yes.

02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:50.668
Oh, it feels good. Oh, yes.

02:24:50.703 --> 02:24:52.502
Beautiful. Beautiful.

02:24:53.002 --> 02:24:56.502
This morning with an epileptic
and now with a blind girl.

02:24:57.502 --> 02:24:59.918
One more like this
and you can open a hospital.

02:25:01.918 --> 02:25:04.418
You're the one that's blind.

02:25:06.418 --> 02:25:07.668
Are they ready?

02:25:14.418 --> 02:25:17.967
A blind girl, huh?

02:25:18.002 --> 02:25:21.800
Thank you. Thank you.
You saved me.

02:25:21.835 --> 02:25:24.460
I was afraid I had
to go on all evening.

02:25:24.495 --> 02:25:27.085
So you come in here
all dressed and perfumed

02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:28.585
to make fools of us.

02:25:29.085 --> 02:25:31.883
Stupid, spoiled.

02:25:31.918 --> 02:25:35.502
How is it you call us?
Hicks? Peasants?

02:25:45.835 --> 02:25:46.835
Uh...

02:25:48.835 --> 02:25:50.835
I know. You're right.

02:25:51.835 --> 02:25:53.835
But it always happens like this.

02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:55.800
I can't stand it.

02:25:55.835 --> 02:25:58.918
So I close my eyes
and I bang into people.

02:25:58.953 --> 02:26:01.883
Does it scare you to look?

02:26:01.918 --> 02:26:06.383
What do you see?
What do you see?

02:26:06.418 --> 02:26:09.918
What does she see?
She sees someone who's so happy...

02:26:12.418 --> 02:26:13.383
I don't want us to change.

02:26:13.418 --> 02:26:16.126
I-- I want everyone to stay still.
Stay still.

02:26:16.161 --> 02:26:18.835
Give me your hands.
Everyone give me their hands.

02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:21.252
Put your hands here.
Here, here.

02:26:33.335 --> 02:26:34.335
Hey, look.

02:26:51.002 --> 02:26:52.418
It's horrible.

02:26:58.835 --> 02:27:00.168
Oh!

02:27:11.502 --> 02:27:13.002
I'm sorry.

02:27:13.502 --> 02:27:16.002
I apologize to all of you.

02:27:17.002 --> 02:27:19.627
It was just-- just a stupid joke.

02:27:19.662 --> 02:27:22.252
It was very silly of me, I know.

02:27:22.287 --> 02:27:23.502
Nothing to worry about.

02:27:24.835 --> 02:27:26.633
I'm sorry!

02:27:26.668 --> 02:27:28.752
I didn't mean to offend anyone!

02:27:29.168 --> 02:27:31.002
Forgive me!

02:27:42.085 --> 02:27:45.300
I'm not blind!
Forgive me!

02:27:45.335 --> 02:27:50.168
I can see very well!
Look, I'm not blind!

02:27:50.203 --> 02:27:51.560
I see all of you!

02:27:51.595 --> 02:27:52.883
Is she drunk or...

02:27:52.918 --> 02:27:55.752
Why don't you believe me?
It was all a joke!

02:27:55.787 --> 02:27:57.252
- She's not drunk.
- I can see like you...

02:27:57.287 --> 02:27:59.467
- She's fantastic.
- and you!

02:27:59.502 --> 02:28:02.800
She smokes, she drives,
she writes poetry.

02:28:02.835 --> 02:28:05.752
She's-- She's very modern,
something you don't understand.

02:28:05.787 --> 02:28:07.383
Hey!

02:28:07.418 --> 02:28:08.418
Something you don't understand.

02:28:08.453 --> 02:28:10.810
You're a country bumpkin.

02:28:10.845 --> 02:28:13.133
- Help! Help!
- Wait.

02:28:13.168 --> 02:28:16.502
Wait! I want to tell you something.
Wait!

02:28:22.918 --> 02:28:25.168
Don't fall.

02:28:25.502 --> 02:28:29.585
Help! Everybody! Hurry!

02:28:34.252 --> 02:28:36.252
And she's wild berries.

02:28:37.752 --> 02:28:39.252
I'll kill them all.

02:28:53.787 --> 02:28:55.252
Hey. Hey.

02:28:56.752 --> 02:28:58.217
Hey.

02:28:58.252 --> 02:28:59.252
Who are you?

02:29:01.252 --> 02:29:02.752
You don't know me.

02:29:04.252 --> 02:29:06.252
What the hell do you want?

02:29:12.168 --> 02:29:13.668
You're boring.

02:29:19.252 --> 02:29:21.960
My name is Ada Fiastri Paulhan.

02:29:21.995 --> 02:29:24.668
I'm 21, the worst age in the world.

02:29:27.752 --> 02:29:31.252
My father designed the head
of the king on the 10 lira note.

02:29:31.752 --> 02:29:34.335
So we've always been
surrounded by money

02:29:34.370 --> 02:29:35.835
and never had any.

02:29:41.502 --> 02:29:43.467
I'm an orphan.

02:29:43.502 --> 02:29:46.467
Three years ago,
my parents had the bright idea

02:29:46.502 --> 02:29:49.002
of organizing an Alpine expedition
for millionaires.

02:29:49.502 --> 02:29:53.002
They disappeared into a crevasse
on the Matterhorn.

02:29:53.037 --> 02:29:56.502
They died the way they lived,
beyond their means.

02:30:04.752 --> 02:30:07.252
I have no sisters, no brothers.

02:30:07.752 --> 02:30:12.252
I can live where I like
and with anybody I like.

02:30:18.418 --> 02:30:20.418
The community house is on fire!

02:30:20.918 --> 02:30:23.418
The community house
is burning to the ground!

02:30:27.252 --> 02:30:29.252
The community house is on fire!

02:31:07.835 --> 02:31:10.300
I don't want to.

02:31:10.335 --> 02:31:12.168
I don't want to!
I don't want to!

02:31:12.203 --> 02:31:14.002
I don't want to!
I don't want to!

02:31:14.037 --> 02:31:15.585
No!

02:31:21.085 --> 02:31:22.550
No.

02:31:35.085 --> 02:31:36.418
Come here.

02:32:21.418 --> 02:32:23.918
Kiss me. Kiss me.

02:32:58.835 --> 02:33:01.335
Why didn't you tell me
you were a virgin?

02:33:01.370 --> 02:33:03.835
Because you would never
have believed me.

02:33:03.870 --> 02:33:05.335
That's right.

02:33:09.335 --> 02:33:11.835
But aren't you Ottavio's mistress?

02:33:12.335 --> 02:33:14.835
Ottavio's mistress?

02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:16.835
No.

02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:18.335
Oh, no.

02:33:23.502 --> 02:33:25.002
Wake up!

02:33:26.002 --> 02:33:28.168
Pietro Pecurare!

02:33:28.203 --> 02:33:30.335
Seventy-eight years old!

02:33:30.370 --> 02:33:31.800
Wake up!

02:33:31.835 --> 02:33:33.335
Farm laborer!

02:33:35.835 --> 02:33:37.800
Wake up!

02:33:37.835 --> 02:33:39.876
Exploited by the landowners!

02:33:39.911 --> 02:33:41.918
Murdered by the fascists!

02:33:42.418 --> 02:33:43.883
Wake up!

02:33:43.918 --> 02:33:47.383
Vircimo Bonazza, age 74,

02:33:47.418 --> 02:33:49.835
day laborer from the age of seven.

02:33:49.870 --> 02:33:51.800
Exploited by the landowners!

02:33:51.835 --> 02:33:54.918
Murdered by the fascists!
Murdered by the fascists!

02:33:54.953 --> 02:33:56.300
Wake up!

02:33:56.335 --> 02:33:59.085
Jofren Zuelli, age 72.

02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:00.168
Wake up!

02:34:00.418 --> 02:34:03.085
Farm laborer from the age of seven.

02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:05.186
Exploited by the landowners!

02:34:05.221 --> 02:34:07.252
Murdered by the fascists!

02:34:08.335 --> 02:34:09.418
Wake up!

02:34:11.835 --> 02:34:13.800
Open your windows!

02:34:13.835 --> 02:34:15.835
Why don't you come down?

02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:16.752
Wake up!

02:34:17.752 --> 02:34:19.752
Don't you want to see?

02:34:22.252 --> 02:34:24.168
Come down and look at them!

02:34:25.668 --> 02:34:27.418
Wake up!

02:34:27.453 --> 02:34:29.168
Wake up!

02:34:31.085 --> 02:34:32.550
Wake up!

02:34:32.585 --> 02:34:34.085
Wake up!

02:34:39.668 --> 02:34:42.668
Look, there's no one!

02:34:59.918 --> 02:35:02.418
It's over. It's all over.

02:35:02.453 --> 02:35:04.185
- It's the end.
- No.

02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:05.918
- It's the end.
- No.

02:35:06.418 --> 02:35:08.002
No, no!

02:35:08.502 --> 02:35:10.418
We're strong!

02:35:10.918 --> 02:35:12.418
We're many!

02:35:12.918 --> 02:35:15.217
We're united!

02:35:15.252 --> 02:35:17.752
They'll kill us all.
They'll kill us all.

02:35:17.787 --> 02:35:19.252
No, no, no.

02:35:19.752 --> 02:35:20.752
No.

02:35:26.502 --> 02:35:27.835
Listen.

02:35:30.835 --> 02:35:32.335
They're coming.

02:35:33.835 --> 02:35:35.300
They're coming.

02:35:35.335 --> 02:35:37.418
Yes. They're coming.

02:35:39.418 --> 02:35:41.668
They're here. Look, Anita.

02:38:23.585 --> 02:38:25.085
I'm not well.

02:38:26.085 --> 02:38:27.835
Could it be the baby?

02:38:27.870 --> 02:38:29.585
What a child you are.

02:38:30.085 --> 02:38:31.585
There's time.

02:38:38.085 --> 02:38:39.668
It's finished.

02:39:10.418 --> 02:39:11.918
Hey, did you see?

02:39:12.918 --> 02:39:14.633
A crowd like that.

02:39:14.668 --> 02:39:16.585
No one will believe
that all those people are relatives.

02:39:17.085 --> 02:39:19.085
- I don't believe it.
- They were over 1,000 of them, Barone.

02:39:19.585 --> 02:39:21.050
Over 1,000, at least.

02:39:21.085 --> 02:39:23.085
They're saying it was no accident.

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:24.585
It was deliberately set.

02:39:34.418 --> 02:39:36.467
There are 2,000 reds out there!

02:39:36.502 --> 02:39:39.502
Hey, Barone, you look
like you've been to a funeral.

02:39:39.537 --> 02:39:41.967
You feel sad?

02:39:42.002 --> 02:39:44.467
You think we made a mistake?

02:39:44.502 --> 02:39:46.883
Never regret anything.
Never be afraid.

02:39:46.918 --> 02:39:49.752
The only thing a man has to fear
is fear itself.

02:39:49.787 --> 02:39:51.717
Shall we take some tucks?

02:39:51.752 --> 02:39:54.085
They give the shirt
a greater elegance.

02:39:54.585 --> 02:39:57.252
I don't want it to look elegant.
I want it to look strong.

02:39:57.287 --> 02:39:59.217
This isn't a shirt, it's a symbol.

02:39:59.252 --> 02:40:02.252
You're not a tailor.
You're making a flag for the people.

02:40:02.287 --> 02:40:03.502
Does it look good, Barone?

02:40:03.537 --> 02:40:05.717
Uh-huh, more manly.

02:40:05.752 --> 02:40:09.168
More manly, yes, but not pretty.
Not pretty. More manly.

02:40:09.203 --> 02:40:11.967
Well, good.
All of you get one. You all get one.

02:40:12.002 --> 02:40:14.502
You all look like this.
Give the people something to follow.

02:40:14.537 --> 02:40:18.002
Yeah. Give me that pussycat.

02:40:18.037 --> 02:40:19.502
Listen.

02:40:20.502 --> 02:40:22.467
Communists are smart.

02:40:22.502 --> 02:40:24.752
They play on your human feelings.

02:40:24.787 --> 02:40:27.394
They're like this little pussycat.

02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:30.002
It plays on your human feelings. Huh?

02:40:31.002 --> 02:40:33.467
Communism is a disease.

02:40:33.502 --> 02:40:35.502
It can destroy the world.
Come outside.

02:40:42.335 --> 02:40:45.633
If this little pussycat
has got communism,

02:40:45.668 --> 02:40:48.126
you can't think of this little pussycat.

02:40:48.161 --> 02:40:50.585
You got to think of all
the other pussycats in the world

02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:52.050
and you got to protect them.

02:40:52.085 --> 02:40:55.085
You got to protect
all those pussycats.

02:40:56.835 --> 02:40:59.502
You got to look at that pussycat
and you've got to say,

02:41:00.002 --> 02:41:03.502
"That's not a pussycat,
that's a communist."

02:41:04.502 --> 02:41:08.085
And you've got to destroy it!

02:41:39.502 --> 02:41:41.002
Where do we make the communists go?

02:41:41.037 --> 02:41:41.967
Jail!

02:41:42.002 --> 02:41:44.085
Where do we make
the Workers' League go?

02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:45.585
Jail to all!

02:42:08.577 --> 02:42:11.243
I feel like I never want
to go home again.

02:42:11.278 --> 02:42:12.243
Swear.

02:42:15.243 --> 02:42:18.077
That you'll never become
a fat, vulgar landowner.

02:42:18.577 --> 02:42:20.660
Swear. Swear!

02:42:24.077 --> 02:42:26.208
I swear. I swear.

02:42:26.243 --> 02:42:29.660
And swear that you'll love me forever
and marry me never.

02:42:30.243 --> 02:42:31.577
Swear! Swear!

02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:40.243
I swear I'll marry you forever!

02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:44.125
Never!

02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:45.660
Give me your hand.

02:42:46.077 --> 02:42:47.493
My hand? Never!

02:42:48.493 --> 02:42:49.958
Oh, you're such a liar!

02:42:49.993 --> 02:42:51.493
Quiet, if you please!

02:42:52.993 --> 02:42:54.493
What's going on?

02:42:54.993 --> 02:42:56.292
Ottavio?

02:42:56.327 --> 02:42:58.327
This is very delicate work I'm doing.

02:42:58.362 --> 02:43:00.243
What are you doing?

02:43:01.743 --> 02:43:04.743
I'm taking some artistic photographs.

02:43:07.827 --> 02:43:10.827
Who are you?
Why are you standing there?

02:43:11.327 --> 02:43:12.792
Us? Oh, we're babes in the woods.

02:43:12.827 --> 02:43:16.208
Oh, yes, with empty stomachs, <i>signora.</i>

02:43:16.243 --> 02:43:20.743
And now that you've discovered
my secret love for, uh, photography?

02:43:20.778 --> 02:43:22.743
Well, I think we know
how to keep a secret.

02:43:22.778 --> 02:43:24.208
Who told you?

02:43:24.243 --> 02:43:25.743
Mr. Ritter just came in
by train from Florence.

02:43:25.778 --> 02:43:27.594
He said that's all
they were talking about.

02:43:27.629 --> 02:43:29.410
Not only that,
but he saw them with his own eyes.

02:43:29.445 --> 02:43:30.660
<i>Carabinieri</i> and the Royal Guard,

02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:32.792
swarming all over the place.

02:43:32.827 --> 02:43:34.827
Lines with fixed bayonets
all along the way.

02:43:34.862 --> 02:43:36.792
- The march on Rome.
- You think so?

02:43:36.827 --> 02:43:38.827
The go-ahead sign will come
when you least expect it.

02:43:38.862 --> 02:43:41.160
And Rome, the whole south
will give way.

02:43:41.195 --> 02:43:42.660
Mussolini is a sculptor of words.

02:43:42.695 --> 02:43:44.427
With every speech...

02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:49.160
- He's an artist.
- He just knows one sentence.

02:43:49.195 --> 02:43:51.660
What's the spiritual question?

02:43:51.695 --> 02:43:53.427
He's a master, a master.

02:43:53.462 --> 02:43:55.160
To spirituality. <i>Salute.</i>

02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:00.577
Are you going to leave me alone?

02:44:02.577 --> 02:44:03.910
Don't go without me.

02:44:04.577 --> 02:44:05.993
After all.

02:44:08.327 --> 02:44:10.660
So, he told him. Loud.

02:44:10.695 --> 02:44:11.625
Right to his face.

02:44:11.660 --> 02:44:13.660
Either the police chief here in Naples

02:44:13.695 --> 02:44:15.160
minds his own business or we...

02:44:15.195 --> 02:44:16.625
That's the only way.

02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:18.125
He's always interfering.

02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:20.076
Too controversial.
Too controversial.

02:44:20.111 --> 02:44:21.958
Castor oil in the morning...

02:44:21.993 --> 02:44:24.993
The only way to handle him
is to be firm.

02:44:25.028 --> 02:44:26.458
It's time we became firm.

02:44:26.493 --> 02:44:28.042
We've been too lenient with them.

02:44:28.077 --> 02:44:29.577
At the Chamber of Commerce
no one knows anything.

02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:31.410
They never have.
They never have and they never will.

02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:33.410
But it's a political maneuver,
isn't it?

02:44:33.445 --> 02:44:35.375
The Chamber of Commerce...

02:44:35.410 --> 02:44:38.910
The Chamber of Commerce! It's more
than political. It's revolutionary.

02:44:38.945 --> 02:44:42.410
Nevertheless, someone at the Chamber
of Commerce should have been told.

02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:45.910
Look, our photographer.

02:44:45.945 --> 02:44:47.660
What is he up to?

02:45:02.327 --> 02:45:04.077
I'll be right there. Wait.

02:45:04.112 --> 02:45:05.792
What's this, a disguise?

02:45:05.827 --> 02:45:07.792
It's the newest thing, Professor.

02:45:07.827 --> 02:45:10.327
If you want to stay in business,
you follow the trend.

02:45:28.493 --> 02:45:30.077
Uh, leave it there.

02:45:33.577 --> 02:45:35.077
Thank you.

02:45:41.493 --> 02:45:42.951
Are we leaving?

02:45:42.986 --> 02:45:44.375
- That's right.
- Ah.

02:45:44.410 --> 02:45:45.743
As soon as we're ready.

02:45:49.993 --> 02:45:51.993
- And where are we going?
- Darmina.

02:45:52.028 --> 02:45:53.493
Darmina. It's an obsession.

02:45:56.493 --> 02:45:57.958
But why?

02:45:57.993 --> 02:45:59.493
To the south, the south.

02:45:59.993 --> 02:46:03.660
Oh, yes, as far away as possible
from those pigs in their black shirts.

02:46:05.660 --> 02:46:08.160
This takes you even farther.

02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:11.660
Even farther south.

02:46:11.695 --> 02:46:13.219
Cocaine?

02:46:13.254 --> 02:46:14.708
Cocaine?

02:46:14.743 --> 02:46:17.410
Oh, I'd like to try some.
Let me try some.

02:46:29.577 --> 02:46:31.660
- Why do you cut it like--
- Shh.

02:46:51.243 --> 02:46:52.743
To the novice.

02:47:25.077 --> 02:47:25.993
Oh!

02:47:26.493 --> 02:47:28.410
- What a tragedy!
- What a waste, you mean.

02:47:28.445 --> 02:47:30.077
-  Oh!
- A little more. Here.

02:47:39.993 --> 02:47:42.993
Ah, ah, just a moment.
Leave some for us.

02:47:43.028 --> 02:47:44.410
Oh, greedy.

02:47:58.410 --> 02:48:00.410
Hey, what's happened to you?

02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:03.875
I can't feel anything.

02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:05.910
- You have to wait a bit.
- You've never done it.

02:48:05.945 --> 02:48:07.677
Give yourself a chance.

02:48:07.712 --> 02:48:09.410
I can't feel anything.

02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:11.410
I mean, uh...

02:48:11.910 --> 02:48:13.410
My nose is numb,

02:48:14.410 --> 02:48:16.410
but I can't feel anything.

02:48:24.327 --> 02:48:25.910
I don't feel a thing.

02:48:25.945 --> 02:48:27.493
Hey, where are you going?

02:48:28.493 --> 02:48:30.493
It's taking effect.

02:48:31.493 --> 02:48:33.958
I can't feel anything.

02:48:33.993 --> 02:48:36.993
Well, anyway.
So, what are we going to do, huh?

02:48:41.993 --> 02:48:42.993
I know.

02:48:44.243 --> 02:48:45.660
I want a photograph.

02:48:45.695 --> 02:48:46.410
Good idea.

02:49:34.993 --> 02:49:36.993
- Who is it?
- Telegram.

02:49:37.028 --> 02:49:39.410
- One moment.
- Coming.

02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:45.410
Be right there.

02:49:49.710 --> 02:49:51.210
<i>Pirouette.</i>

02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:54.910
<i>Jeté.</i>

02:50:00.660 --> 02:50:02.160
<i>Port de bras.</i>

02:50:06.827 --> 02:50:08.660
Here I come. Lift.

02:50:12.993 --> 02:50:14.660
It's for you.

02:50:29.493 --> 02:50:31.993
You have to leave right away.

02:50:32.028 --> 02:50:33.077
Your father is ill.

02:50:35.577 --> 02:50:37.292
Hold it.

02:50:37.327 --> 02:50:38.577
Perfect.

02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:55.160
Hey.

02:54:03.577 --> 02:54:05.077
What are you doing?

02:54:05.112 --> 02:54:06.077
Nothing.

02:54:10.077 --> 02:54:12.077
Wearing your father's coat.

02:54:17.577 --> 02:54:20.077
What are you doing
in my father's study?

02:54:23.577 --> 02:54:26.077
And with my father's gun, hmm?

02:54:28.077 --> 02:54:29.827
I'm keeping it.

02:54:33.327 --> 02:54:35.827
Oh, go ahead.
It doesn't matter.

02:54:35.862 --> 02:54:37.827
He doesn't need it.

02:54:41.827 --> 02:54:43.327
How did he die?

02:54:45.493 --> 02:54:46.993
In the cow shed.

02:54:48.993 --> 02:54:50.493
He said, uh,

02:54:52.993 --> 02:54:55.993
"My legs are weak,
as if I were dreaming."

02:54:56.993 --> 02:54:59.493
He didn't suffer at all.

02:54:59.827 --> 02:55:00.910
Hmm.

02:55:01.410 --> 02:55:03.375
The cow shed, huh?

02:55:03.410 --> 02:55:05.910
It seems to run in the family.

02:55:08.410 --> 02:55:10.910
You've been away for a month.

02:55:11.410 --> 02:55:13.910
There are a lot of things
you don't know.

02:55:18.410 --> 02:55:19.910
Send Attila away.

02:55:20.910 --> 02:55:22.910
There's still time.

02:55:23.410 --> 02:55:25.410
Fire him at once.

02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:26.910
Today.

02:55:27.910 --> 02:55:28.910
Huh?

02:55:32.243 --> 02:55:33.993
No, it wouldn't do any good.

02:55:34.028 --> 02:55:35.708
He's a fascist, a killer!

02:55:35.743 --> 02:55:39.208
Kick him out.
It will make an impression.

02:55:39.243 --> 02:55:43.208
Not now. Mussolini's won.
Italy's really changed.

02:55:43.243 --> 02:55:46.660
Things have changed here, too.
I've changed and so have you.

02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:51.125
- What do you mean?
- I mean, uh...

02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:53.160
You give the orders now,
for God's sake.

02:55:53.195 --> 02:55:54.660
You're the master!

02:55:56.577 --> 02:55:57.577
Then I'm your master.

02:55:58.077 --> 02:55:58.827
Olmo.

02:56:00.493 --> 02:56:03.243
Olmo. Quick, they're coming back.

02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:06.660
Olmo.

02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:12.660
Here, take it with you.
It's yours anyway.

02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:17.160
Otherwise, what kind of a thief
would you be?

02:56:22.660 --> 02:56:24.160
Is that your baby
with your mother?

02:56:24.195 --> 02:56:25.660
Yes.

02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:27.660
It's a girl.

02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:29.493
And Anita?

02:56:30.410 --> 02:56:33.410
She died giving birth.

02:56:54.910 --> 02:56:56.410
Listen to me, Alfredo,

02:56:57.410 --> 02:56:59.410
send Attila away.

02:57:35.077 --> 02:57:38.577
I prayed and prayed
that you'd come in time.

02:57:38.612 --> 02:57:40.577
Now you are all I have left.

02:57:45.743 --> 02:57:48.243
How he suffered after you went away.

02:57:54.243 --> 02:57:56.243
Do you mind waiting outside?

02:58:08.077 --> 02:58:09.577
Mama, I have something to tell you.

02:58:09.612 --> 02:58:12.077
Sit down. Sit down.

02:58:12.577 --> 02:58:14.077
I have something to tell everyone.
Sit down.

02:58:14.112 --> 02:58:16.077
Sit down, Aunt Amelia.
Sit down.

02:58:19.077 --> 02:58:20.077
Uh...

02:58:22.577 --> 02:58:24.577
I have, uh, something
to tell everyone.

02:58:25.577 --> 02:58:26.577
Um...

02:58:29.077 --> 02:58:32.577
I don't know if I should say this.

02:58:32.612 --> 02:58:33.577
Maybe I should wait.

02:58:34.077 --> 02:58:36.577
It's not exactly the right moment
to say this but--

02:58:37.077 --> 02:58:38.042
Uh...

02:58:38.077 --> 02:58:40.410
I've decided something and, um...

02:58:42.993 --> 02:58:44.493
Uh...

02:58:46.910 --> 02:58:48.493
I'm getting married.

02:58:50.660 --> 02:58:54.160
Do you think that this is
the right moment to joke?

02:58:58.077 --> 02:58:59.577
What a rush.

02:59:03.077 --> 02:59:04.452
Is she pregnant?

02:59:12.910 --> 02:59:14.910
What's her name?

02:59:16.410 --> 02:59:17.410
Ada.

02:59:18.910 --> 02:59:19.910
Ada.

02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:32.410
Of a good family? Huh?

02:59:35.410 --> 02:59:37.410
Is she chic?
Tell me, is she chic?

02:59:37.445 --> 02:59:39.875
- She is French.
- Oh!

02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:41.910
She's traveled and she's educated?

02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:45.701
Is she pretty?

02:59:45.736 --> 02:59:47.458
And healthy?

02:59:47.493 --> 02:59:49.993
Oh, we'll have a wedding
that'll make everyone die of envy.

02:59:50.493 --> 02:59:52.243
- When will it be?
- Very soon.

03:00:08.743 --> 03:00:10.375
Long live the bride!

03:00:10.410 --> 03:00:13.910
- Long live the bride!
- Long live the bride and groom!

03:00:13.945 --> 03:00:16.875
- Alfredo!
- God bless you both, fearless youth.

03:00:16.910 --> 03:00:22.910
Your faith is with us
like a presage of love and affection,

03:00:22.945 --> 03:00:25.875
a haven of prolific happiness together.

03:00:25.910 --> 03:00:29.910
That by the bride's
moral pledge of fidelity

03:00:29.945 --> 03:00:32.410
shall continue this noble race

03:00:32.910 --> 03:00:34.875
touched by that divine light.

03:00:34.910 --> 03:00:37.910
A light that shall guide from strife

03:00:38.410 --> 03:00:40.910
each new child
in his walk through life.

03:00:42.712 --> 03:00:44.375
She's too pretty.

03:00:44.410 --> 03:00:46.375
Far too pretty for a wife.

03:00:46.410 --> 03:00:49.410
She's more than a wife.
Ada's a mistress.

03:00:49.445 --> 03:00:50.910
Mistress, my ass.

03:00:50.945 --> 03:00:51.910
Oh!

03:00:52.410 --> 03:00:54.160
She won't be any good in bed.

03:00:54.195 --> 03:00:55.910
Regina, what a way to talk.

03:00:59.410 --> 03:01:01.077
I give her one year.

03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:07.410
Alfredo. Alfredo,
she's so beautiful.

03:01:09.410 --> 03:01:11.375
Enchanting, really.

03:01:11.410 --> 03:01:13.410
Oh, how delightful, this party.

03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:17.660
I was so glad when I heard
that we were invited.

03:01:24.493 --> 03:01:26.827
You're really a piece of shit.

03:01:28.577 --> 03:01:30.077
You know, I hate you.

03:01:30.577 --> 03:01:32.160
I detest you.

03:01:33.993 --> 03:01:35.910
I should be in your place.

03:01:39.077 --> 03:01:40.160
May I?

03:01:42.577 --> 03:01:43.660
A souvenir.

03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:45.493
May I?

03:01:49.993 --> 03:01:50.993
Wait.

03:01:58.910 --> 03:02:00.827
You will look so pretty,

03:02:02.243 --> 03:02:03.493
like a bride.

03:02:33.077 --> 03:02:35.042
I put my bet on Attila!

03:02:35.077 --> 03:02:37.077
What are you talking about?
Falcone will win.

03:02:39.410 --> 03:02:41.208
Attila. Attila will beat him.

03:02:41.243 --> 03:02:42.708
- Come on, come on!
- Come on, Falcone!

03:02:42.743 --> 03:02:44.243
If you pin him,
half of my money is yours.

03:02:44.278 --> 03:02:45.243
Come on, Falcone,
you can do it!

03:02:45.278 --> 03:02:46.743
Attila!

03:02:49.327 --> 03:02:50.827
Ah! My bride.

03:03:14.493 --> 03:03:17.243
Oh, look at Attila's gloves.
They're beautiful.

03:03:17.278 --> 03:03:18.927
You'd like me to get you a pair?

03:03:18.962 --> 03:03:20.577
Papa, if you do,
I'll be good. I swear.

03:03:20.612 --> 03:03:21.993
And a black shirt, too?

03:03:31.577 --> 03:03:33.792
<i>Signor</i> Alfredo,

03:03:33.827 --> 03:03:36.743
together we salute you
and your new bride.

03:03:36.778 --> 03:03:38.493
Get off the table!

03:03:51.160 --> 03:03:52.625
Send them away.

03:03:52.660 --> 03:03:54.493
I can't stand them.
I can't stand them!

03:03:56.993 --> 03:03:58.958
Look, don't be upset.

03:03:58.993 --> 03:04:01.743
These are only our neighbors,
the same as always.

03:04:01.778 --> 03:04:04.969
The only difference is
the color of their shirts.

03:04:05.004 --> 03:04:08.125
That's what I mean.
It makes all the difference.

03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:11.077
They're like our relatives.
We have to invite them to our wedding.

03:04:11.112 --> 03:04:13.577
After this, we won't have
to see them for another 10 years.

03:04:13.612 --> 03:04:15.577
Oh, 100 years. Promise.

03:04:17.077 --> 03:04:19.077
A thousand years, I promise.

03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:30.993
Is it all one family?

03:04:31.493 --> 03:04:32.958
Yes, all Dalcos.

03:04:32.993 --> 03:04:35.827
Before the war,
there were twice as many.

03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:40.701
Who is that beautiful woman
by the fire?

03:04:40.736 --> 03:04:43.493
Oh, that's Rosina.
That's Olmo's mother.

03:04:43.993 --> 03:04:45.458
Where is Olmo?

03:04:45.493 --> 03:04:48.077
I looked for him.
I haven't seen him all day.

03:04:48.112 --> 03:04:49.577
And Ottavio?

03:04:50.410 --> 03:04:52.035
I'll never forgive him.

03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:53.660
Fine friends we have.

03:04:58.660 --> 03:05:00.160
Go on. Go on. Go.

03:05:03.160 --> 03:05:05.160
Rosina, would you like some confetti?

03:05:05.660 --> 03:05:08.410
Oh, thank you, <i>signora.</i>
Thank you.

03:05:08.445 --> 03:05:11.160
I knew him when he was so high.

03:05:11.195 --> 03:05:12.160
So long ago.

03:05:19.743 --> 03:05:21.542
It was almost dawn
when we stopped the trucks

03:05:21.577 --> 03:05:24.577
in front of that tavern,
and saw the boys from Ferrara.

03:05:24.612 --> 03:05:26.594
I swear to you, we couldn't...

03:05:26.629 --> 03:05:28.577
Glorious day, Serafini. Glorious.

03:05:29.077 --> 03:05:31.077
- Regina.
- To us, gentlemen.

03:05:33.577 --> 03:05:36.410
And then they started yelling,
"Let's march on to Rome," and so on, you know.

03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:55.910
Just remember something.
You keep well away from Ada.

03:05:55.945 --> 03:05:58.410
Who'd dare to touch
your precious wife, huh?

03:05:59.910 --> 03:06:02.618
You think she'll stand living here

03:06:02.653 --> 03:06:05.327
with the pigs, the shit, the Dalcos?

03:06:09.327 --> 03:06:10.327
Attila.

03:06:14.327 --> 03:06:16.077
Shut the door.

03:06:16.112 --> 03:06:17.827
Shut the door!

03:06:28.160 --> 03:06:30.125
It is not the tradition
of this household

03:06:30.160 --> 03:06:33.160
to have our staff members,
together with family members,

03:06:33.195 --> 03:06:35.427
mixing on the dining room table.

03:06:35.462 --> 03:06:37.625
If you have the irresistible urge

03:06:37.660 --> 03:06:39.660
to express yourselves
in this manner again,

03:06:39.695 --> 03:06:41.660
you will do it outside the house.

03:06:42.743 --> 03:06:44.243
Is that clear?

03:06:45.743 --> 03:06:48.243
This is what you were waiting for.

03:06:53.243 --> 03:06:55.243
To become the <i>padrone.</i>

03:06:57.243 --> 03:06:59.827
God only knows how long
you have been waiting.

03:07:01.827 --> 03:07:03.327
And another thing,

03:07:05.327 --> 03:07:09.292
I know you look impressive
in that uniform,

03:07:09.327 --> 03:07:13.827
but my wife doesn't want
to have any Black Shirts in the house.

03:07:15.743 --> 03:07:17.577
Many women are...

03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:20.708
Come on, Alfredo.

03:07:20.743 --> 03:07:25.160
He's not educated, I agree,
but listen to me.

03:07:25.195 --> 03:07:27.493
Hang on to him.
He's your watchdog.

03:07:29.993 --> 03:07:31.493
Well, where were you, watchdog,

03:07:31.993 --> 03:07:33.577
when they broke
into my father's file?

03:07:33.612 --> 03:07:35.077
No.

03:07:36.077 --> 03:07:37.375
No.

03:07:37.410 --> 03:07:40.077
What happened to the gun
he kept in there?

03:07:46.577 --> 03:07:48.542
Must have been a communist.

03:07:48.577 --> 03:07:51.827
They don't even have respect
for the dead.

03:07:54.660 --> 03:07:57.160
You and your bride
can rest without fear.

03:07:58.660 --> 03:08:00.910
The gun will be returned
to its proper place.

03:08:00.945 --> 03:08:02.375
Never mind the gun.

03:08:02.410 --> 03:08:05.493
You're here to keep Regina
as far away from my wife as possible.

03:08:07.327 --> 03:08:08.827
Send me away.

03:08:10.827 --> 03:08:12.660
Why don't you send me away?

03:08:12.695 --> 03:08:14.160
No, I want you here.

03:08:21.410 --> 03:08:22.910
You're part of the inheritance.

03:08:27.660 --> 03:08:30.160
This is the prettiest house...

03:08:38.743 --> 03:08:40.743
Attila, look at me.

03:08:41.243 --> 03:08:42.743
It's an arm-wrestle.

03:08:51.993 --> 03:08:54.993
Is it true you win
all the arm-wrestles?

03:09:06.410 --> 03:09:09.410
And when I think how fond I am
of this house.

03:09:10.410 --> 03:09:13.875
Regina, it's been decided.

03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:16.660
We're all moving into the city.

03:09:16.695 --> 03:09:19.302
They have a right to be alone.

03:09:19.337 --> 03:09:21.910
And you tell me just like that?

03:09:26.410 --> 03:09:29.410
I'm not coming.
I'll stay here.

03:09:56.077 --> 03:09:57.660
Oh! Look who's here.

03:09:57.695 --> 03:09:58.660
Ottavio.

03:10:06.577 --> 03:10:09.410
It's a little late.
Your wedding present.

03:10:09.445 --> 03:10:11.660
My wedding present. Oh!

03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:13.660
Ottavio!

03:10:14.577 --> 03:10:15.875
Thank you.

03:10:15.910 --> 03:10:17.743
His name is Cocaine.

03:10:17.778 --> 03:10:18.993
Cocaine.

03:10:25.410 --> 03:10:28.410
- Beautiful.
- Thank you, Uncle.

03:10:28.445 --> 03:10:30.375
He's beautiful.

03:10:30.410 --> 03:10:32.410
His name is Cocaine.

03:10:33.410 --> 03:10:35.410
I want to ride him.

03:10:36.410 --> 03:10:37.910
Oh, the stirrup.

03:10:39.410 --> 03:10:41.410
One, two, three, up.

03:10:59.577 --> 03:11:01.910
Oh! Oh!
What a stunning gift.

03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:05.410
How magnificent.

03:11:10.910 --> 03:11:12.410
Come in here, you coward.

03:11:22.493 --> 03:11:24.458
Now, you make love to me here,

03:11:24.493 --> 03:11:26.458
- in this house.
- I'll make love to you.

03:11:26.493 --> 03:11:29.243
- I'll make love to you...
- It's my house, too.

03:11:29.278 --> 03:11:31.993
- so hard.
- I'm part of the inheritance.

03:11:37.993 --> 03:11:40.458
Didn't you know?

03:11:40.493 --> 03:11:43.493
The gentry have a special place
to masturbate.

03:11:45.493 --> 03:11:47.743
Alfredo and I used to do it here.

03:11:49.493 --> 03:11:50.577
You're a beast!

03:11:51.577 --> 03:11:54.875
I felt so sorry for you.

03:11:54.910 --> 03:11:58.410
Standing there,
taking the insults.

03:11:58.445 --> 03:12:00.493
At heel beside your master.

03:12:01.993 --> 03:12:03.827
- I'm his watchdog.
- Then bite!

03:12:03.862 --> 03:12:05.292
Bark!

03:12:05.327 --> 03:12:07.702
Don't let him treat me that way.

03:12:07.737 --> 03:12:09.823
He cannot treat me that way!

03:12:09.858 --> 03:12:11.910
What kind of a man are you?

03:12:16.910 --> 03:12:18.160
Who are you?

03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:30.660
Never bite the hand
that feeds you

03:12:31.660 --> 03:12:33.792
so long as you need to be fed.

03:12:33.827 --> 03:12:36.743
But Alfredo is rotten!
He's rotten!

03:12:36.778 --> 03:12:38.243
Alfredo's your cousin.

03:12:48.743 --> 03:12:50.208
Look at the bitch.

03:12:50.243 --> 03:12:52.743
Just married and she's running away.

03:13:03.077 --> 03:13:04.577
Regina,

03:13:05.577 --> 03:13:07.077
I love you.

03:13:11.077 --> 03:13:13.042
I gain strength

03:13:13.077 --> 03:13:16.077
from insult and humiliation.

03:13:17.577 --> 03:13:19.077
I gain strength.

03:13:20.077 --> 03:13:23.077
And Italy is my master.

03:13:23.112 --> 03:13:25.042
I serve only her.

03:13:25.077 --> 03:13:27.993
That is what we marched for.

03:13:30.493 --> 03:13:34.160
The rich, they take and they steal
and they--

03:13:34.195 --> 03:13:37.827
They eat. They eat well
and they are rotten.

03:13:38.827 --> 03:13:41.292
We fascists,

03:13:41.327 --> 03:13:44.327
we eat crumbs and we gain strength.

03:13:49.827 --> 03:13:51.827
Alfredo Berlinghieri,

03:13:53.327 --> 03:13:54.827
you,

03:13:55.827 --> 03:13:58.327
and all parasites,

03:13:59.827 --> 03:14:02.292
will pay the bill

03:14:02.327 --> 03:14:04.327
for the fascist revolution.

03:14:05.327 --> 03:14:08.077
And the bill will not be cheap.

03:14:08.112 --> 03:14:10.827
The bill will not be cheap.

03:14:11.827 --> 03:14:13.327
Everybody will pay.

03:14:13.827 --> 03:14:16.327
Everybody, rich and poor,
gentry and peasant,

03:14:16.827 --> 03:14:20.077
they will pay with money
and land and bread

03:14:20.112 --> 03:14:23.327
and cows and cheese
and blood and shit!

03:14:30.243 --> 03:14:31.743
You really love me?

03:14:33.743 --> 03:14:35.243
You love me?

03:14:41.243 --> 03:14:43.243
Will you love me forever?

03:14:44.243 --> 03:14:45.243
Attila?

03:15:05.410 --> 03:15:09.410
Regina, I love you forever.

03:15:13.577 --> 03:15:15.077
Here are your gloves.

03:15:15.112 --> 03:15:17.094
My gloves.

03:15:17.129 --> 03:15:19.077
Our best man.

03:15:27.410 --> 03:15:29.910
Have you ever played
the wedding game, huh?

03:15:34.910 --> 03:15:35.743
Huh?

03:15:38.493 --> 03:15:40.743
Have you ever played
the wedding game?

03:15:55.993 --> 03:15:59.625
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
My net! Keep still!

03:15:59.660 --> 03:16:03.076
Keep still!
You'll rip my net. You're scaring him.

03:16:03.111 --> 03:16:06.493
You'll rip my net.
It costs money. Keep still.

03:16:06.660 --> 03:16:09.660
Get me out of here!
What are you waiting for?

03:16:09.695 --> 03:16:11.160
If you don't keep still
for a minute...

03:16:11.195 --> 03:16:12.375
Oh!

03:16:12.410 --> 03:16:15.327
Take it easy and you'll be free again.

03:16:19.243 --> 03:16:21.410
Well? Come on!

03:16:21.445 --> 03:16:22.410
Uh-huh.

03:16:25.827 --> 03:16:27.952
Can you...
Can you help me?

03:16:27.987 --> 03:16:30.282
What is this net doing here?

03:16:30.317 --> 03:16:32.577
It's a trap, a trap for brides.

03:16:35.827 --> 03:16:37.160
Do you catch many?

03:16:38.160 --> 03:16:39.493
You're the first.

03:16:40.827 --> 03:16:41.785
And the last.

03:16:41.820 --> 03:16:42.743
Help me down.

03:16:51.493 --> 03:16:52.493
Is all this land ours?

03:16:52.993 --> 03:16:53.993
All yours.

03:16:54.993 --> 03:16:57.493
I have a feeling
I'm going to like it here.

03:16:57.528 --> 03:16:59.493
I used to think
I hated the country.

03:17:03.493 --> 03:17:05.993
Oh, I love the smell of earth.

03:17:06.028 --> 03:17:07.993
That's dried shit.

03:17:10.993 --> 03:17:11.993
What's in there?

03:17:12.028 --> 03:17:12.993
No, no!

03:17:14.493 --> 03:17:15.493
No!

03:17:16.493 --> 03:17:18.743
My birds are in there.

03:17:18.778 --> 03:17:20.635
What are you doing?

03:17:20.670 --> 03:17:22.493
Help me up now.

03:17:35.743 --> 03:17:37.743
They were all at the party today,
except you.

03:17:38.243 --> 03:17:39.243
Yes, except me.

03:17:41.743 --> 03:17:44.743
Alfredo thinks of you
as a real friend, you know that.

03:17:44.778 --> 03:17:46.458
Yes, I know.

03:17:46.493 --> 03:17:48.792
I know, but we're different.

03:17:48.827 --> 03:17:51.243
So perhaps you're not
such good friends.

03:17:51.278 --> 03:17:52.493
Perhaps.

03:17:53.493 --> 03:17:55.160
Maybe you're enemies!

03:17:57.743 --> 03:17:59.208
Patrizio!

03:17:59.243 --> 03:18:00.708
What did you have to eat?

03:18:00.743 --> 03:18:03.243
- Patrizio!
- All kinds of <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>

03:18:03.278 --> 03:18:04.743
and salmon mousse.

03:18:06.243 --> 03:18:08.660
- And what else?
- Larks on a spit,

03:18:08.695 --> 03:18:11.077
fresh sturgeon and suckling pig.

03:18:11.112 --> 03:18:12.042
Have you seen my son?

03:18:12.077 --> 03:18:14.042
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- And what else?

03:18:14.077 --> 03:18:15.577
If I catch him,
I'll give him a real thrashing.

03:18:15.612 --> 03:18:16.993
All the usual boiled meats with...

03:18:17.028 --> 03:18:18.302
Patrizio.

03:18:18.337 --> 03:18:19.577
Patrizio!

03:18:23.077 --> 03:18:24.077
Patrizio!

03:18:27.243 --> 03:18:28.410
Patrizio!

03:19:15.077 --> 03:19:16.327
Patrizio.

03:19:21.910 --> 03:19:24.618
Are you gonna tell someone on us?
Will you?

03:19:24.653 --> 03:19:27.327
Are you gonna tell someone on us?
Will you?

03:19:27.660 --> 03:19:28.577
You wouldn't tell anyone on us.

03:19:28.612 --> 03:19:30.042
Let me go.

03:19:30.077 --> 03:19:32.327
Let me go! Let me go!

03:19:32.577 --> 03:19:34.077
No! No, let me go!

03:20:06.077 --> 03:20:07.958
Patrizio!

03:20:07.993 --> 03:20:10.327
Come on, let's search
through there.

03:20:10.362 --> 03:20:11.327
Patrizio!

03:20:12.327 --> 03:20:13.868
Patrizio!

03:20:13.903 --> 03:20:15.410
Patrizio!

03:20:15.910 --> 03:20:17.910
Not here, not there.

03:20:20.243 --> 03:20:21.243
Patrizio!

03:20:22.243 --> 03:20:23.743
Patrizio!

03:20:28.660 --> 03:20:31.458
Patrizio!

03:20:31.493 --> 03:20:33.410
- Patrizio!
- I'm getting mud all over my shoes.

03:20:33.445 --> 03:20:35.410
Are you sure he didn't go home?

03:20:37.243 --> 03:20:38.493
Patrizio!

03:20:42.327 --> 03:20:44.792
Patrizio!

03:20:44.827 --> 03:20:48.243
Where are you hiding?
Patrizio! Patrizio!

03:20:48.743 --> 03:20:50.077
I don't feel like seeing him now.

03:20:50.112 --> 03:20:51.827
I'll come tomorrow.

03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:57.201
Alfredo!

03:20:57.236 --> 03:20:58.493
Patrizio!

03:20:59.993 --> 03:21:00.958
Patrizio!

03:21:00.993 --> 03:21:03.493
I didn't see you at Mass.

03:21:03.528 --> 03:21:04.993
Thanks for coming.

03:21:06.077 --> 03:21:07.493
Patrizio!

03:21:13.660 --> 03:21:14.743
Good catch?

03:21:15.743 --> 03:21:17.493
A few thrushes.

03:21:17.528 --> 03:21:19.208
A few thrushes.

03:21:19.243 --> 03:21:21.577
- Patrizio!
- Patrizio!

03:21:21.612 --> 03:21:22.958
Patrizio!

03:21:22.993 --> 03:21:24.827
- Patrizio!
- Patrizio!

03:21:27.827 --> 03:21:29.160
Do you like my wife?

03:21:29.660 --> 03:21:32.493
Very good-looking couple,
Ada and the horse.

03:21:33.993 --> 03:21:35.827
Where's my father's gun?

03:21:38.827 --> 03:21:40.327
I've hidden it.

03:21:41.827 --> 03:21:43.792
You'd better be careful.

03:21:43.827 --> 03:21:46.243
If you don't use it,
it gets rusty.

03:21:46.278 --> 03:21:48.219
- Patrizio!
- Patrizio!

03:21:48.254 --> 03:21:50.160
Did you look in the chicken coop?

03:21:51.660 --> 03:21:53.660
Yes, we're going to the farm now.

03:21:54.327 --> 03:21:55.792
Patrizio!

03:21:55.827 --> 03:21:57.827
It belonged to Lady Godiva,
you know.

03:21:57.862 --> 03:21:59.827
- Then I should ride him nude.
- How nice.

03:21:59.862 --> 03:22:01.577
It's the right moment.

03:22:20.993 --> 03:22:22.993
- What's happened?
- In-- In there.

03:22:35.660 --> 03:22:37.660
<i>Signora!</i>
<i>Signora,</i> what is it?

03:22:38.660 --> 03:22:40.160
In there.

03:22:41.160 --> 03:22:42.660
In there.

03:23:38.577 --> 03:23:41.327
What have they done to him?

03:23:41.362 --> 03:23:43.493
What have they done?

03:23:43.743 --> 03:23:45.125
What have they done to him?

03:23:45.160 --> 03:23:47.160
- It happened just a little while ago.
- What have they done?

03:23:47.195 --> 03:23:49.660
He must still be around.

03:23:49.695 --> 03:23:50.785
Look, look!

03:23:54.910 --> 03:23:55.910
You.

03:23:57.910 --> 03:23:59.410
You weren't at the wedding.

03:23:59.445 --> 03:24:00.743
I know him!

03:24:01.660 --> 03:24:03.160
He'd kill us all!

03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:07.327
They're all alike, those peasants.

03:24:45.077 --> 03:24:46.410
Olmo Dalco,

03:24:48.910 --> 03:24:49.910
don't move.

03:24:51.410 --> 03:24:54.910
I accuse you of the murder
of this child.

03:25:12.327 --> 03:25:13.493
Hit him!

03:25:15.327 --> 03:25:17.243
Murderer! Hit him!

03:25:34.577 --> 03:25:36.077
Olmo!

03:25:36.910 --> 03:25:37.910
Olmo!

03:25:46.327 --> 03:25:47.743
They're killing him.

03:25:52.493 --> 03:25:54.202
But Olmo had nothing to do with it.

03:25:54.577 --> 03:25:56.910
He couldn't have.
He was with me.

03:25:58.910 --> 03:26:00.958
Go on, kill him!

03:26:00.993 --> 03:26:03.577
He killed him! Killed!

03:26:04.077 --> 03:26:06.743
One day they'll kill all of you!

03:26:07.743 --> 03:26:09.827
I know who killed him.

03:26:13.660 --> 03:26:14.660
I did.

03:26:15.827 --> 03:26:17.243
Killer!

03:26:17.743 --> 03:26:19.243
Killer!

03:26:20.993 --> 03:26:23.577
- The killer has come.
- I didn't mean to.

03:26:23.612 --> 03:26:25.493
It was an accident.

03:26:26.160 --> 03:26:28.625
Come on.

03:26:28.660 --> 03:26:30.910
Attila, stop that.
That's enough.

03:26:30.945 --> 03:26:33.160
That's all. Stop it.
Stop. Stop!

03:26:49.410 --> 03:26:50.410
Take this man to the police.

03:26:50.445 --> 03:26:52.292
I didn't do it.

03:26:52.327 --> 03:26:56.208
I never hurt a fly.
I didn't do it.

03:26:56.243 --> 03:27:00.243
I'm a little crazy.
I was joking. I only said it because...

03:27:00.278 --> 03:27:02.743
Look, he's been stealing food.

03:27:07.243 --> 03:27:09.993
Ladies and gentlemen,
the reception is over.

03:27:10.028 --> 03:27:12.743
It's beginning to rain,
and it's getting dark,

03:27:12.778 --> 03:27:15.243
and I think everyone
should leave now.

03:27:37.577 --> 03:27:41.077
Look at the state Olmo's in.
Why didn't you stop them?

03:27:41.112 --> 03:27:42.594
What do you mean,
the state Olmo's in?

03:27:42.629 --> 03:27:44.042
What about the state
Patrizio was in?

03:27:44.077 --> 03:27:46.577
Olmo's innocent!
I told you, I was with him!

03:27:46.612 --> 03:27:48.542
I know you were with him!

03:27:48.577 --> 03:27:51.077
You're becoming like them. Worse.

03:27:55.577 --> 03:27:58.542
No! Ottavio, no!

03:27:58.577 --> 03:28:00.577
Don't go away.
No, stay.

03:28:03.577 --> 03:28:05.042
I'm sorry, Ada.

03:28:05.077 --> 03:28:07.535
I'll never set foot here again.

03:28:52.077 --> 03:28:53.077
No!

03:28:55.077 --> 03:28:58.493
All right, another one.
Come on. Let's pull him out.

03:29:17.493 --> 03:29:18.993
Get him on his back.

03:29:21.493 --> 03:29:23.160
Hold him, now.

03:29:35.577 --> 03:29:37.910
Hey, Olmo, let him work.
Let him work.

03:29:40.160 --> 03:29:41.410
That's got him.

03:29:43.243 --> 03:29:45.743
Papa! Papa!

03:29:53.243 --> 03:29:54.243
What a hand, huh?

03:29:54.743 --> 03:29:56.243
Exact. Two squares, anytime.

03:29:57.743 --> 03:30:00.243
Nobody can kill pigs
as good as my papa.

03:30:03.743 --> 03:30:05.292
Watch out, Olmo.

03:30:05.327 --> 03:30:08.077
We saw Attila, and he said,
to slaughter our hogs,

03:30:08.112 --> 03:30:10.792
we're a lot better off
if we find someone else.

03:30:10.827 --> 03:30:13.743
He said you took on this work
so you'd be free to go to each house

03:30:13.778 --> 03:30:16.708
and preach revolution,
family by family.

03:30:16.743 --> 03:30:18.743
How is a man to live
if he can't work?

03:30:18.778 --> 03:30:21.243
Like Attila.
He feeds on evil.

03:30:28.243 --> 03:30:29.875
Stella.

03:31:35.493 --> 03:31:37.993
Stella. Stella, we need more water.

03:31:39.493 --> 03:31:41.493
Here's some water.

03:31:48.743 --> 03:31:50.827
There's more hot water.

03:32:15.910 --> 03:32:16.993
You're Olmo!

03:32:20.243 --> 03:32:22.077
You don't recognize me.

03:32:24.577 --> 03:32:26.077
There was an amnesty.
They let me go.

03:32:26.577 --> 03:32:28.577
I've been walking for 30 days.

03:32:28.612 --> 03:32:29.702
You came back?

03:32:29.743 --> 03:32:33.014
I walk and I walk and I walk.
Can't stop.

03:32:33.049 --> 03:32:36.285
Then why did you have
to mix in that day?

03:32:36.327 --> 03:32:38.577
You were down on the ground.

03:32:38.612 --> 03:32:40.761
They were all on top of you.

03:32:40.796 --> 03:32:42.910
They were beating you to death.

03:32:44.410 --> 03:32:46.702
All those years in jail for nothing.

03:32:46.743 --> 03:32:49.708
In jail, in a barn,

03:32:49.743 --> 03:32:51.743
under a tree, what's the difference?

03:34:11.160 --> 03:34:14.125
Stop it! Stop it!
You know what they'll do.

03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:17.243
You keep singing that song,
they'll break your heads, that's what.

03:34:17.278 --> 03:34:19.427
The fascists will put you in jail

03:34:19.462 --> 03:34:21.577
if you make jokes about Mussolini.

03:34:21.612 --> 03:34:23.077
I didn't kill the boy.

03:34:25.577 --> 03:34:28.042
You didn't kill the boy.

03:34:28.077 --> 03:34:30.577
It was one of those men
with the black shirts on.

03:34:30.612 --> 03:34:31.577
Who?

03:34:33.077 --> 03:34:35.702
I saw him hide the body in the cave.

03:34:35.743 --> 03:34:36.958
Who was it?

03:34:36.993 --> 03:34:38.493
It's hard to say.

03:34:40.493 --> 03:34:42.993
In black shirts,
all killers look the same.

03:34:44.493 --> 03:34:46.993
I walk and I walk and I walk.

03:34:48.493 --> 03:34:49.993
Can't stop.

03:34:51.493 --> 03:34:54.542
Where is socialism?

03:34:54.577 --> 03:34:56.493
When you get what you want,
you want more,

03:34:56.993 --> 03:34:58.785
like animals that eat
because they can't stop.

03:34:58.827 --> 03:35:01.452
The <i>padrone</i> can't stop.
You become a <i>padrone,</i> you can't stop.

03:35:01.487 --> 03:35:04.077
You get a piece of land,
then you want another piece.

03:35:04.112 --> 03:35:05.042
That's human nature.

03:35:05.077 --> 03:35:07.577
We gotta fight human nature.
That's what's no good.

03:35:07.612 --> 03:35:08.577
Stella.

03:35:14.243 --> 03:35:17.243
The seminaries take in studs
and they fall out mules.

03:35:17.278 --> 03:35:18.702
No good to anybody.

03:35:18.743 --> 03:35:21.208
Tell them, Carlino.
You're smarter than they think.

03:35:21.243 --> 03:35:23.702
You let the priests pay for your keep
three or four years,

03:35:23.743 --> 03:35:26.743
then we give them a boot in the ass
and long live Lenin.

03:35:26.778 --> 03:35:28.208
What Lenin?

03:35:28.243 --> 03:35:30.243
You've got to start
facing the truth.

03:35:30.278 --> 03:35:31.702
They abolished our paper,

03:35:32.243 --> 03:35:34.243
the community house is gone
and no more election.

03:35:34.278 --> 03:35:37.243
But this changed.
Look here.

03:35:37.278 --> 03:35:39.702
Read it. It's your newspaper.

03:35:40.243 --> 03:35:41.702
The one our comrades print.

03:35:42.243 --> 03:35:45.702
We could go to prison.
You can see how many have read it.

03:35:45.743 --> 03:35:48.458
Now memorize it.
It's up to you.

03:35:48.493 --> 03:35:51.410
Because once this is gone,
you'll teach the others.

03:35:51.445 --> 03:35:54.327
Those who don't see it
and those who can't read. Here.

03:35:54.362 --> 03:35:56.469
All right, I'll memorize the newspaper,

03:35:56.504 --> 03:35:58.577
but what good is it
if we have no party?

03:35:58.612 --> 03:36:00.542
No leader?
Nobody to lead us?

03:36:00.577 --> 03:36:03.542
Look at us, Olmo.
We're all scattered.

03:36:03.577 --> 03:36:05.577
If one of us opens his mouth,
he gets slapped in jail.

03:36:05.612 --> 03:36:08.118
Our party's outlawed,
we haven't got a chance.

03:36:08.660 --> 03:36:12.118
No party? It's not true.
The party is no one but you.

03:36:12.660 --> 03:36:15.625
And Eugene and Enzo and Armando.

03:36:15.660 --> 03:36:18.118
Cross over the river,
you'll find only Azales.

03:36:18.660 --> 03:36:21.118
Need more, then go
and speak with the bellman.

03:36:21.160 --> 03:36:24.639
You'll see the party around you
wherever you find hardworking men.

03:36:24.674 --> 03:36:28.118
Go inside the prisons
and you'll see hundreds of your comrades.

03:36:28.160 --> 03:36:30.160
The party's there, too.
It's everywhere.

03:36:30.195 --> 03:36:32.160
Tell him, Eugene.
You tell him.

03:36:43.452 --> 03:36:46.868
"A hundred factory workers
were arrested at Rossi Textiles.

03:36:47.410 --> 03:36:48.868
"While 135 were..."

03:36:48.910 --> 03:36:50.417
Anita!

03:36:50.452 --> 03:36:52.952
Anita? Where'd my daughter go?

03:36:53.452 --> 03:36:54.952
Anita!

03:36:54.993 --> 03:36:58.285
Olmo, she went to the <i>padrona</i>
for a lesson.

03:36:58.327 --> 03:36:59.827
What <i>padrona?</i>

03:37:00.327 --> 03:37:02.077
<i>Signora</i> Ada.

03:37:02.112 --> 03:37:03.792
Ada. Ada.

03:37:03.827 --> 03:37:06.285
"Strikers paraded in the city streets.

03:37:06.327 --> 03:37:08.660
"Several came to blows
with fascist city officials

03:37:08.695 --> 03:37:10.035
"who tried to block the demonstration,

03:37:10.070 --> 03:37:12.285
"including fascist Mayor Aliani.

03:37:12.327 --> 03:37:15.327
"The officials were forced
to call Milano for extra <i>carabinieri.</i>

03:37:15.362 --> 03:37:16.594
"While fighting with the troops,

03:37:16.629 --> 03:37:17.827
"four of our comrades were killed."

03:37:21.743 --> 03:37:24.743
I don't know where you'll get
the courage to go home tonight.

03:37:24.778 --> 03:37:26.743
His wife will kill him!

03:37:28.243 --> 03:37:30.243
Hey, Berlinghieri,
I want a return match.

03:37:30.278 --> 03:37:32.702
Now, now, now.
Calm down, Ferrara.

03:37:32.743 --> 03:37:35.243
You've just lost
your whole stable of livestock.

03:37:35.278 --> 03:37:36.702
What else can you stake?

03:37:36.743 --> 03:37:39.243
He wants to end up
like your mayor friend in Mantua.

03:37:43.243 --> 03:37:46.243
Clothes of honor,
and not much money,

03:37:46.278 --> 03:37:47.743
the mayor stakes his wife.

03:37:51.993 --> 03:37:55.208
- Oh, I'm sorry. Forgive me.
- <i>Signor</i> Alfredo.

03:37:55.243 --> 03:37:58.577
<i>Cavaliere</i> Pioppi would like
to have a word with you.

03:37:58.612 --> 03:38:00.375
What shall I say to him?

03:38:00.410 --> 03:38:04.202
I thought I told you not to come
into this place with mud on your shoes.

03:38:07.993 --> 03:38:09.493
<i>Cavaliere</i> Pioppi.

03:38:14.827 --> 03:38:17.285
You all know <i>Cavaliere</i> Pioppi,

03:38:19.327 --> 03:38:21.792
the only honest man among us.

03:38:21.827 --> 03:38:24.285
Now, if you'll excuse us
for a few minutes.

03:38:24.327 --> 03:38:27.827
No, don't worry. Don't worry about it.
Everything will be all right.

03:38:27.862 --> 03:38:30.285
You'll have a return match.
You'll lose some more livestock.

03:38:30.327 --> 03:38:32.410
Thank God you have your health.

03:38:39.243 --> 03:38:42.243
I'm glad one of us
has a little enjoyment.

03:38:42.278 --> 03:38:43.243
We've, uh...

03:38:44.660 --> 03:38:47.160
We've trouble making ends meet.

03:38:47.618 --> 03:38:50.118
Our lands have been barren.
We've, uh...

03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:53.160
As you must know,
your father and I were friends.

03:38:53.195 --> 03:38:54.583
He was always telling me,

03:38:54.618 --> 03:38:57.208
"Careful, Pioppi,
you're not an administrator.

03:38:57.243 --> 03:39:00.305
"You let things get out of hand."
But he'd help us.

03:39:00.340 --> 03:39:03.368
Yes, he helped us.
He helped us sign so many mortgages

03:39:03.410 --> 03:39:06.951
there's not a piece of land
left in our name.

03:39:06.986 --> 03:39:10.493
I wouldn't have bothered you,
only she insisted.

03:39:10.528 --> 03:39:13.493
You and I have been
rather good friends.

03:39:13.993 --> 03:39:15.493
It's embarrassing.
I, uh...

03:39:15.993 --> 03:39:16.958
How much do you need?

03:39:16.993 --> 03:39:19.458
Oh, I knew you wouldn't refuse us.

03:39:19.493 --> 03:39:21.493
You're more understanding
than your father was.

03:39:21.528 --> 03:39:22.958
Well.

03:39:22.993 --> 03:39:27.493
Well, do you have anything left
to mortgage at all?

03:39:28.993 --> 03:39:30.493
The villa.

03:39:34.993 --> 03:39:36.493
Olmo.

03:39:36.993 --> 03:39:37.993
Hello.

03:39:41.910 --> 03:39:43.910
The house, you said?

03:39:43.945 --> 03:39:45.285
The villa.

03:39:51.827 --> 03:39:53.792
- You're not allowed in here.
- Get away.

03:39:53.827 --> 03:39:56.285
You don't learn easy, do you, boy?
You don't listen, do you?

03:39:56.327 --> 03:39:58.292
Get away!

03:39:58.327 --> 03:40:01.327
You've been told 100 times you're
not allowed in here. Don't you push me!

03:40:01.362 --> 03:40:03.827
Somebody's gonna teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

03:40:03.862 --> 03:40:06.285
- Get away!
- Now, you get out of here!

03:40:06.327 --> 03:40:09.327
You don't learn, do you?
You're gonna come to a bad end, boy.

03:40:09.362 --> 03:40:10.827
You think you're the king
of this fucking castle.

03:40:11.327 --> 03:40:12.792
- Get away.
- Attila.

03:40:12.827 --> 03:40:14.285
The time's come when I'll show you,
once and for all, you're not!

03:40:14.327 --> 03:40:16.306
- Now, you get out of here!
- Get away!

03:40:16.341 --> 03:40:18.285
What the hell is going on over here?

03:40:22.785 --> 03:40:25.285
His shoes are dirty.

03:40:25.327 --> 03:40:28.327
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

03:40:29.785 --> 03:40:31.785
All right, I'm poor,

03:40:32.327 --> 03:40:35.618
a peasant, a worker and a killer.

03:40:35.653 --> 03:40:36.577
And I want my daughter!

03:40:37.077 --> 03:40:38.077
Attila!

03:41:01.327 --> 03:41:02.827
"By the..."

03:41:02.862 --> 03:41:04.327
"Rushes."

03:41:04.785 --> 03:41:08.118
"rushes and under the sky,

03:41:08.160 --> 03:41:10.868
"my lovely house doth lie."

03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:13.410
Good girl. Here you are.

03:41:23.827 --> 03:41:25.292
Anita, come home.

03:41:25.327 --> 03:41:27.243
But, Papa, not before I finish.

03:41:30.035 --> 03:41:33.493
I don't like you to come here,
you know that.

03:41:33.528 --> 03:41:35.993
She has to learn
how to read and write.

03:41:44.577 --> 03:41:46.577
You're not her mother.

03:41:47.577 --> 03:41:49.577
I don't want her here!

03:41:57.077 --> 03:41:59.042
He's right, you know.

03:41:59.077 --> 03:42:02.577
I mean, what the hell gives you the right
to act like a missionary?

03:42:02.612 --> 03:42:05.077
What the hell gives you the right?

03:42:06.577 --> 03:42:08.542
I love that child!

03:42:08.577 --> 03:42:10.577
I don't care whether you love that child.

03:42:10.612 --> 03:42:12.577
The child is out of place here.

03:42:15.077 --> 03:42:17.577
Leave other people's children alone.

03:42:24.202 --> 03:42:28.077
All right.
Now I'll devote myself to our children!

03:42:28.112 --> 03:42:30.077
No, don't!
Just devote yourself to me!

03:42:42.577 --> 03:42:46.077
Oh, November's the
cruelest month of the year.

03:42:52.910 --> 03:42:53.868
Damn it!

03:42:55.160 --> 03:42:58.042
Bitch. Filthy bitch!

03:42:58.077 --> 03:43:00.952
But I'll get in there.
I'll get a bottle.

03:43:11.743 --> 03:43:13.202
The key.

03:43:14.202 --> 03:43:16.077
Now, give me the key.

03:43:17.077 --> 03:43:18.042
The key!

03:43:18.077 --> 03:43:21.042
Go and get drunk at the tavern.

03:43:21.077 --> 03:43:23.577
We're respectable people
here in this house.

03:43:23.612 --> 03:43:25.077
Didn't you know that? Huh?

03:43:29.327 --> 03:43:30.952
I want that key!

03:43:31.452 --> 03:43:32.952
I stick it up your ass!

03:43:49.202 --> 03:43:51.202
You stupid thing.

03:43:52.202 --> 03:43:53.702
How stupid you are.

03:43:53.743 --> 03:43:56.202
But why shouldn't you have
what you want?

03:43:56.237 --> 03:43:58.167
You must drink all you want.

03:43:58.202 --> 03:44:00.702
You're the <i>padrona.</i>
Aren't you the <i>padrona?</i>

03:44:00.743 --> 03:44:03.202
So you'll have all the drink you want.

03:44:12.327 --> 03:44:14.827
Help me.
Why don't you help me?

03:44:14.862 --> 03:44:16.875
You want a drink?

03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:19.125
I don't want it anymore.

03:44:19.160 --> 03:44:22.535
I baptize you, Regina,
queen of the bitches.

03:44:54.202 --> 03:44:55.202
Ada!

03:45:03.827 --> 03:45:05.160
Good evening.

03:45:11.660 --> 03:45:14.660
Go to bed, little witch.
Go on.

03:45:17.660 --> 03:45:18.660
Ada.

03:45:25.660 --> 03:45:27.160
Good night, angel.

03:45:27.660 --> 03:45:29.160
Sleep well.

03:45:32.660 --> 03:45:33.993
<i>Signora,</i>

03:45:34.910 --> 03:45:36.702
care for some wine?

03:45:39.035 --> 03:45:41.035
Yes, I don't mind if I do.

03:45:42.535 --> 03:45:44.952
A drop is good from time to time.

03:45:44.987 --> 03:45:46.452
Two or three, even.

03:45:46.487 --> 03:45:47.952
Uh-huh.

03:45:52.535 --> 03:45:54.535
It's so nice here.

03:45:56.035 --> 03:45:57.868
What's so nice, may I ask?

03:45:59.327 --> 03:46:01.327
Anita saying good night.

03:46:02.493 --> 03:46:04.493
The smell of your supper.

03:46:05.993 --> 03:46:07.993
The way you are all together.

03:46:10.493 --> 03:46:13.493
And your mother sleeping by the fire.

03:46:19.410 --> 03:46:21.910
Well, you may live here if you
find it so nice. I'll put in a cot.

03:46:21.945 --> 03:46:25.500
You know the big doors
that open into the court?

03:46:25.535 --> 03:46:28.368
Every evening, the <i>padrone</i>
would close everybody in.

03:46:28.403 --> 03:46:29.333
Really?

03:46:29.368 --> 03:46:30.368
I remember the key.

03:46:31.243 --> 03:46:33.243
It was as big as that.

03:46:38.243 --> 03:46:40.743
And so the peasants
were all locked up,

03:46:40.778 --> 03:46:42.243
same as prison.

03:46:43.743 --> 03:46:46.577
We were able to dance,
to sing to our children.

03:46:47.077 --> 03:46:49.868
Able to die,
but impossible to get out.

03:46:51.368 --> 03:46:54.368
We had to be shut up
like beasts till morning.

03:46:57.077 --> 03:46:58.597
Then what happened?

03:46:58.632 --> 03:47:00.118
Came the morning,

03:47:00.618 --> 03:47:03.660
the <i>padrone</i> would send a servant
to open the door for us.

03:47:05.493 --> 03:47:08.493
I'm not talking
about the Middle Ages, either.

03:47:08.528 --> 03:47:09.993
- Amusing, no?
- No.

03:47:10.028 --> 03:47:11.493
Hmm.

03:47:11.993 --> 03:47:14.993
Grandfather Leo was alive.
I was just a little boy.

03:47:17.327 --> 03:47:21.535
Once Alfredo got into our house here

03:47:22.535 --> 03:47:24.827
and was locked up
with all of us.

03:47:28.535 --> 03:47:31.035
Well, the doors are open now...

03:47:33.035 --> 03:47:35.035
but Alfredo never comes.

03:47:44.785 --> 03:47:47.667
What do you think of Alfredo?

03:47:47.702 --> 03:47:50.702
The <i>padrone</i> are our enemies.
We have to destroy them all.

03:47:50.737 --> 03:47:52.368
<i>The padrone's</i> Alfredo.

03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:53.910
And me?

03:47:55.368 --> 03:47:57.333
You are the <i>padrona.</i>

03:47:57.368 --> 03:48:00.493
No, not really.
I am the wife of the <i>padrone.</i>

03:48:01.993 --> 03:48:04.868
Hmm.

03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:08.827
Anita, don't you think her mother
would have wanted her to study?

03:48:08.862 --> 03:48:10.118
Olmo.

03:48:10.993 --> 03:48:13.202
Rosina, we woke you up.

03:48:13.237 --> 03:48:14.292
Olmo.

03:48:14.327 --> 03:48:15.875
- It's all right.
- Go away.

03:48:15.910 --> 03:48:18.264
- I had a terrible dream, Olmo.
- It's all right, Mama.

03:48:18.299 --> 03:48:20.618
I was on the top of a mountain
with Grandfather Leo.

03:48:20.653 --> 03:48:21.875
- Yes.
- "Look down," he said.

03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:23.910
- Come to bed.
- "Those are the years to come.

03:48:24.410 --> 03:48:26.618
- "One is limping, another is blind."
- It's all right.

03:48:26.653 --> 03:48:28.702
- "That one has no head."
- It's late, Mama.

03:48:28.737 --> 03:48:30.250
Take little Anita and run away.

03:48:30.285 --> 03:48:33.035
Run, Olmo.
Everything's gone to ruin.

03:48:40.327 --> 03:48:41.785
Do you hear that? He's there.

03:48:42.285 --> 03:48:43.750
Shut up.

03:48:43.785 --> 03:48:46.785
Over there. I saw him.
He was moving.

03:48:48.452 --> 03:48:50.917
He comes to spy.

03:48:50.952 --> 03:48:53.952
Go away, go away.
Leave us alone.

03:48:54.952 --> 03:48:56.452
Do something!

03:49:04.452 --> 03:49:05.452
Here?

03:49:08.452 --> 03:49:09.452
Here?

03:49:13.952 --> 03:49:14.952
It's a cat!

03:49:18.452 --> 03:49:20.452
Every night I dream of that kid.

03:49:22.452 --> 03:49:24.952
He's all covered with blood.

03:49:26.452 --> 03:49:27.952
I hate him.

03:49:28.452 --> 03:49:30.452
You drive me crazy.

03:49:31.952 --> 03:49:34.618
I'll never come
to this fucking room again!

03:49:36.118 --> 03:49:39.118
Don't be angry.
I'm fed up, too.

03:49:39.153 --> 03:49:42.083
Whenever we feel like doing it,

03:49:42.118 --> 03:49:45.118
we have to behave
like a couple of thieves.

03:49:46.118 --> 03:49:47.542
Hiding.

03:49:47.577 --> 03:49:50.077
You could change all that
if you wanted to.

03:49:50.112 --> 03:49:52.094
You give the orders around here.

03:49:52.129 --> 03:49:54.103
He's as weak as a jellyfish.

03:49:54.138 --> 03:49:56.042
Ada's drunk all the time.

03:49:56.077 --> 03:49:59.077
You have the keys to everything,
don't you, my dear?

03:50:02.452 --> 03:50:05.410
No. I deserve a house of my own,

03:50:05.445 --> 03:50:07.410
fit for somebody like me.

03:50:11.410 --> 03:50:12.910
I know one.

03:50:14.410 --> 03:50:15.875
Where?

03:50:15.910 --> 03:50:17.375
Villa Pioppi.

03:50:17.410 --> 03:50:19.410
The mortgage is nearly due.

03:50:23.410 --> 03:50:24.910
Can't you see us,

03:50:25.910 --> 03:50:27.875
the two of us,

03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:31.410
sitting together in Chinese dressing gowns,

03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:34.910
listening to the radio broadcast from Rome?

03:50:35.410 --> 03:50:37.410
A servant very quietly comes in

03:50:38.910 --> 03:50:41.410
with two glasses of Marsala wine.

03:50:42.910 --> 03:50:46.410
Marsala, my ass.
I want champagne.

03:51:44.785 --> 03:51:45.785
Hey!

03:51:46.285 --> 03:51:48.750
Stella!

03:51:48.785 --> 03:51:51.868
Hey, where are you running?
What's the matter, sweetheart?

03:51:52.368 --> 03:51:53.368
They took him away!

03:51:53.868 --> 03:51:56.535
My Martino and his brother Gelindo!

03:51:56.570 --> 03:51:58.917
Who did it?

03:51:58.952 --> 03:52:00.952
It's those guards.
They're taking them away.

03:52:01.452 --> 03:52:04.333
The guards? What? Wait.

03:52:04.368 --> 03:52:07.743
Wait. All of you, come with me.

03:52:11.327 --> 03:52:14.292
No. Olmo, where are you going?

03:52:14.327 --> 03:52:17.868
Have you lost your head?
Will you put that gun away?

03:52:17.903 --> 03:52:19.365
You'll get us all in trouble.

03:52:19.400 --> 03:52:20.967
You promised to look out for us

03:52:21.002 --> 03:52:22.535
and not lose your head like this.

03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:25.910
Prison.

03:52:28.702 --> 03:52:30.202
Yes, prison.

03:52:32.202 --> 03:52:33.202
Prison.

03:52:33.702 --> 03:52:35.167
Prison.

03:52:35.202 --> 03:52:37.202
Olmo, where are you going?

03:52:37.237 --> 03:52:38.202
Prison!

03:52:39.202 --> 03:52:40.993
Come back, Olmo!

03:52:44.327 --> 03:52:45.327
Wait, Stella!

03:52:51.327 --> 03:52:53.327
Martino! Gelindo!

03:52:57.368 --> 03:52:58.868
Wait, Stella.

03:53:01.868 --> 03:53:03.333
Stella.

03:53:03.368 --> 03:53:06.535
Hold on, comrades!
We'll get you out of this!

03:53:07.452 --> 03:53:10.035
Stop. You'll only make it worse.

03:53:13.035 --> 03:53:15.493
- Hold on! Hold on!
- No, no!

03:53:15.528 --> 03:53:17.958
Martino! Gelindo!

03:53:17.993 --> 03:53:20.243
You'll make it worse!

03:53:20.278 --> 03:53:22.708
Come, come.

03:53:22.743 --> 03:53:26.077
There are hundreds of us!
There are thousands!

03:53:26.112 --> 03:53:29.660
There's no room in your jails
to keep us!

03:53:29.695 --> 03:53:31.000
What are you doing, Olmo?

03:53:31.035 --> 03:53:33.035
Can't you see you're all alone?

03:53:35.202 --> 03:53:36.702
Stella, wait!

03:53:38.785 --> 03:53:40.667
No, no!

03:53:40.702 --> 03:53:43.167
The party won't abandon you!

03:53:43.202 --> 03:53:47.202
Yes, but these chains hurt!
They hurt all the same!

03:54:05.118 --> 03:54:06.417
Christ is with us.

03:54:06.452 --> 03:54:08.910
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

03:54:08.945 --> 03:54:11.368
Since my husband died,
they haven't left me in peace.

03:54:11.403 --> 03:54:12.868
I have nothing but debts.

03:54:13.368 --> 03:54:14.910
But all the same,
I have always made my offering

03:54:14.945 --> 03:54:16.875
for the holy wounds of Jesus.

03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:19.410
It's true I don't have
the money for the mortgage,

03:54:19.445 --> 03:54:21.375
but I look at it this way,

03:54:21.410 --> 03:54:24.410
if I have to choose
between the mortgage and the holy wounds,

03:54:24.445 --> 03:54:26.375
then I choose the wounds.

03:54:26.410 --> 03:54:28.514
They wish I were dead, anyway.

03:54:28.549 --> 03:54:30.618
Oh, this has become a fixation.

03:54:31.118 --> 03:54:33.618
Don't you know
that blaming others is a sin?

03:54:33.653 --> 03:54:35.083
A very bad sin.

03:54:35.118 --> 03:54:36.618
You don't believe me?

03:54:38.118 --> 03:54:40.118
What do you call this, then?

03:54:40.952 --> 03:54:42.875
Look, here's the proof.

03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:45.910
Please, come on, please,
I can't bear cats, even live ones.

03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:49.375
He used to sleep with me.

03:54:49.410 --> 03:54:52.375
They want to hurt the things I love.

03:54:52.410 --> 03:54:55.410
They want to hurt me!
They want to take everything away from me!

03:54:55.445 --> 03:54:57.910
They're wicked people!

03:55:33.868 --> 03:55:34.702
There's the car.

03:55:35.202 --> 03:55:37.035
- Well, at last.
- Yes.

03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:38.077
Here.

03:55:44.785 --> 03:55:47.285
Aren't you coming in?
They're waiting for you.

03:55:47.320 --> 03:55:48.917
No, no, not tonight.

03:55:48.952 --> 03:55:50.452
At least tonight,
one should stay at home.

03:55:50.952 --> 03:55:52.167
Come on, Josephine.

03:55:52.202 --> 03:55:54.702
- Don't eat too much.
- <i>Ciao,</i> Pierro.

03:55:54.737 --> 03:55:56.407
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

03:55:56.442 --> 03:55:58.042
- Evening, <i>signor.</i>
- Good evening.

03:55:58.077 --> 03:55:59.535
We'll play cards later.
Maybe I'll get lucky.

03:55:59.570 --> 03:56:02.535
Yes. See you all about midnight.

03:56:02.570 --> 03:56:04.667
<i>Ciao. Ciao.</i>

03:56:50.118 --> 03:56:51.618
Merry Christmas.

03:56:51.653 --> 03:56:53.118
Merry Christmas.

03:56:54.118 --> 03:56:55.326
Merry Christmas.

03:56:55.361 --> 03:56:56.535
Merry Christmas.

03:57:13.952 --> 03:57:15.417
Merry Christmas.

03:57:15.452 --> 03:57:18.417
You know how long
I've been looking for you?

03:57:18.452 --> 03:57:21.452
<i>Signora</i> Berlinghieri
can no longer drink at home

03:57:21.487 --> 03:57:24.417
because the wine is locked away.

03:57:24.452 --> 03:57:26.917
She can no longer
drink in small cafes

03:57:26.952 --> 03:57:29.952
because her husband
has given orders against it.

03:57:31.452 --> 03:57:33.417
So she drinks in taverns.

03:57:33.452 --> 03:57:36.452
I'm going to have you
locked up in an asylum.

03:57:40.452 --> 03:57:41.917
I can drink here.

03:57:41.952 --> 03:57:44.368
I can even fall under the table.

03:57:49.285 --> 03:57:51.285
Nobody sees me anyway.

03:57:53.785 --> 03:57:55.785
Get up from there. Get up.

03:57:56.785 --> 03:57:58.785
You look disgusting.

03:58:00.285 --> 03:58:02.785
Your face is all swollen
from the alcohol.

03:58:02.820 --> 03:58:04.750
You stink. Get up.

03:58:04.785 --> 03:58:07.285
- <i>...full of the Christmas spirit...</i>
- Get up.

03:58:07.320 --> 03:58:09.285
<i>as you can tell
with their fun-loving song.</i>

03:58:09.320 --> 03:58:11.250
Do I disgust you, too?

03:58:11.285 --> 03:58:14.702
<i>...and right into your homes,
where on Christmas Eve</i>

03:58:14.993 --> 03:58:16.493
<i>everyone should find comfort and...</i>

03:58:16.528 --> 03:58:19.458
Am I swollen?

03:58:19.493 --> 03:58:24.035
<i>...and social order.
Happy mothers and fathers, but above all...</i>

03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:26.500
Do I stink?

03:58:26.535 --> 03:58:28.500
Do you need help, <i>signora?</i>

03:58:28.535 --> 03:58:31.535
<i>...favorite book or favorite dolly,
they find a piece of Christmas holly.</i>

03:58:32.035 --> 03:58:33.500
<i>Let's get along
to one more song.</i>

03:58:33.535 --> 03:58:36.410
Don't get mixed up.
They'll only take you for a fool.

03:58:41.410 --> 03:58:43.910
I know why you don't want me to drink.

03:58:45.410 --> 03:58:46.410
It's because when I drink,

03:58:46.910 --> 03:58:49.410
it gives me the courage
to tell you the truth.

03:58:50.910 --> 03:58:54.375
You are different.
You have changed.

03:58:54.410 --> 03:58:58.910
You are surrounded by terrible,
vulgar, arrogant bullies.

03:58:58.945 --> 03:59:00.410
Murderers.

03:59:10.410 --> 03:59:13.327
And you are even worse
than they are.

03:59:13.362 --> 03:59:16.327
Come. Have a drink with us.

03:59:17.327 --> 03:59:19.452
My husband wants to meet you.

03:59:19.487 --> 03:59:21.542
Come on.
It's getting late.

03:59:21.577 --> 03:59:25.042
Stop staring at them.
Come on. Let's go.

03:59:25.077 --> 03:59:28.785
Stop staring, you idiot.
They'll get you in trouble. Move.

03:59:30.785 --> 03:59:32.785
Hey! Hey!

03:59:33.660 --> 03:59:34.660
Hey, wait a minute.

03:59:39.160 --> 03:59:40.625
You can't refuse a drink.

03:59:40.660 --> 03:59:42.660
Let us go, <i>signora,</i> please.

03:59:43.660 --> 03:59:45.410
Where are you going?

03:59:45.445 --> 03:59:47.240
To wash, <i>signora.</i>

03:59:47.275 --> 03:59:49.000
- Why?
- It's Christmas.

03:59:49.035 --> 03:59:52.583
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Stay like this.

03:59:52.618 --> 03:59:55.118
You're much more beautiful
the way you are.

04:00:01.618 --> 04:00:03.618
Can I have your cap?

04:00:05.118 --> 04:00:07.618
- You really want it?
- Yes.

04:00:07.653 --> 04:00:09.083
To remember you by.

04:00:09.118 --> 04:00:13.118
Excuse us, <i>signora.</i>
Excuse us, please.

04:00:36.952 --> 04:00:38.417
What do you want?

04:00:38.452 --> 04:00:40.952
What do you want me to do? Huh?

04:00:42.743 --> 04:00:43.743
<i>Signore,</i> we're closing.

04:00:43.778 --> 04:00:44.743
We're leaving.

04:00:46.243 --> 04:00:48.243
I'll get your coat.

04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:57.410
Charcoal.

04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:59.410
Charcoal.

04:00:59.910 --> 04:01:02.125
Charcoal.

04:01:02.160 --> 04:01:04.160
Charcoal for sale.

04:01:05.368 --> 04:01:06.827
You slut.

04:01:07.327 --> 04:01:09.827
You like fooling around with everyone.

04:01:09.862 --> 04:01:10.827
Even Olmo.

04:01:10.862 --> 04:01:12.292
Olmo?

04:01:12.327 --> 04:01:14.792
What an imagination.

04:01:14.827 --> 04:01:17.952
Is it my imagination
to have seen you together?

04:01:18.285 --> 04:01:19.917
That I've seen you
with him before?

04:01:19.952 --> 04:01:23.250
Is it my imagination
that I smell him on you?

04:01:23.285 --> 04:01:26.910
Do you think Olmo would have anything
to do with the wife of a fascist?

04:01:26.945 --> 04:01:29.618
Fascist?
I am not a fascist!

04:01:29.910 --> 04:01:32.118
If you call me that again,
I will kill you!

04:01:32.153 --> 04:01:34.292
If I see you again with him,
I will kill you!

04:01:34.327 --> 04:01:37.327
You'll kill me
because we can't make love anymore.

04:01:37.827 --> 04:01:38.827
Fighting, huh?

04:01:40.827 --> 04:01:43.327
Lucky you.
I guess you love each other.

04:02:00.118 --> 04:02:01.660
How are you?

04:02:02.160 --> 04:02:03.785
How are you?

04:02:07.285 --> 04:02:08.535
You know her?

04:02:08.570 --> 04:02:09.785
I think so.

04:02:11.785 --> 04:02:12.827
Sit down.

04:02:14.327 --> 04:02:15.327
Uh...

04:02:16.827 --> 04:02:17.827
Neve?

04:02:18.827 --> 04:02:20.243
Uh, Neve, this is Ada.

04:02:24.243 --> 04:02:26.243
I'm glad you remember me.

04:02:31.243 --> 04:02:34.243
What about you?
You're not from around here.

04:02:35.743 --> 04:02:38.208
You look like a lady.

04:02:38.243 --> 04:02:40.243
But you are a lady, aren't you?

04:02:41.243 --> 04:02:43.708
She's my wife.

04:02:43.743 --> 04:02:47.118
You know, after that day,
I never had another attack.

04:02:47.153 --> 04:02:51.167
Oh, God knows
what went on in my head.

04:02:51.202 --> 04:02:53.702
And then I found a man, a good man.
I liked him.

04:02:53.737 --> 04:02:55.702
I-- I was very fond of him.

04:02:56.202 --> 04:02:59.667
When my mother died, we got married.
A hard worker.

04:02:59.702 --> 04:03:02.702
We settled down here, on this street.
I still live here.

04:03:03.202 --> 04:03:04.167
What happened to him?

04:03:04.202 --> 04:03:06.202
Oh, he disappeared one day.

04:03:06.237 --> 04:03:09.167
I never saw him again.

04:03:09.202 --> 04:03:13.327
But even if he's taken up
with another woman, I'm happy.

04:03:13.362 --> 04:03:15.292
I learn about how to manage

04:03:15.327 --> 04:03:18.292
and how I can get by fine on my own.

04:03:18.327 --> 04:03:21.827
There were no children.
It's the only thing I miss.

04:03:21.862 --> 04:03:25.327
You know, I never knew
if it was my fault or his.

04:03:26.827 --> 04:03:29.327
Oh, my cake. I forgot.

04:03:32.618 --> 04:03:34.618
Why don't you stay here
and eat with us?

04:03:35.118 --> 04:03:37.083
They are nice people, you know.

04:03:37.118 --> 04:03:40.077
And where can you go
this time of night?

04:03:40.577 --> 04:03:42.542
You'll enjoy it, you'll see.

04:03:42.577 --> 04:03:45.042
Oh, Neve, I thought
you'd never show up.

04:03:45.077 --> 04:03:48.577
She must have lost time at the baker's.
So many people waiting.

04:04:01.077 --> 04:04:02.577
Alfredo,

04:04:04.077 --> 04:04:05.577
I want a child.

04:04:08.035 --> 04:04:11.035
Go. Go to your midnight Mass.

04:04:11.070 --> 04:04:12.952
<i>Ciao,</i> Oreste.
Merry Christmas.

04:04:12.987 --> 04:04:14.917
Sing your hearts out.

04:04:14.952 --> 04:04:18.368
Let everybody know
what hypocrites you are.

04:04:18.403 --> 04:04:21.750
Careful, Oreste.
The devil will take you.

04:04:21.785 --> 04:04:25.285
I'm not afraid of the devil.
He's red, like me.

04:04:25.320 --> 04:04:27.250
And when I die...

04:04:27.285 --> 04:04:29.285
- Who lives here?
- Attila Mellanchini.

04:04:29.320 --> 04:04:30.785
He's really come up in the world.

04:04:31.285 --> 04:04:32.052
He lives here alone?

04:04:32.452 --> 04:04:34.917
No, with his beloved Regina.

04:04:34.952 --> 04:04:37.452
The most envied couple
in the whole valley.

04:04:37.487 --> 04:04:39.792
- Really?
- Yes.

04:04:39.827 --> 04:04:42.327
Merry Christmas, <i>Signorina</i> Regina!

04:04:43.827 --> 04:04:46.743
What are you doing out there in the cold?
Come inside.

04:04:46.778 --> 04:04:49.243
Merry Christmas, <i>Signora</i> Pioppi!

04:04:49.278 --> 04:04:51.535
We don't want to be late for Mass!

04:04:52.410 --> 04:04:53.875
Oh...

04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:55.868
We can have a drop
to warm ourselves,

04:04:55.903 --> 04:04:57.827
then we can all three go together.

04:04:57.862 --> 04:05:00.792
Oh, she's really crazy.

04:05:00.827 --> 04:05:02.327
First, she cuts me down in public,

04:05:02.362 --> 04:05:04.327
then invites us for a drink.

04:05:04.362 --> 04:05:05.292
Marvelous.

04:05:05.327 --> 04:05:07.327
Maybe she's trying to make up to us.

04:05:08.827 --> 04:05:10.792
What difference does it make?

04:05:10.827 --> 04:05:13.702
Well, aren't you coming?

04:05:13.737 --> 04:05:16.160
Let's see what it's like inside.

04:05:40.035 --> 04:05:42.535
Merry Christmas, Mr. Mayor.

04:05:44.535 --> 04:05:47.000
You're making fun of me.

04:05:47.035 --> 04:05:49.535
They'll elect you
one of these days.

04:05:49.570 --> 04:05:51.535
You're still a young man.

04:05:52.035 --> 04:05:54.035
Young and strong.

04:05:58.535 --> 04:06:02.535
Everything is so artistic,
just like being abroad.

04:06:06.535 --> 04:06:09.035
The house is perfect for a real lady.

04:06:11.535 --> 04:06:12.500
Very elegant.

04:06:12.535 --> 04:06:13.535
Very--

04:06:13.570 --> 04:06:15.035
Very tasteful.

04:06:18.035 --> 04:06:20.000
Do you really think so?

04:06:20.035 --> 04:06:22.035
Come and see the living room.

04:06:37.577 --> 04:06:39.042
What is she doing?

04:06:39.077 --> 04:06:41.077
I told you, she's mad.

04:06:43.577 --> 04:06:44.577
Uh...

04:06:51.952 --> 04:06:53.417
Caught you, didn't I?

04:06:53.452 --> 04:06:56.208
Now you'll have to listen to me.

04:06:56.243 --> 04:06:58.743
I'm the one doing the talking now.

04:06:58.778 --> 04:07:00.208
You want to get out?

04:07:00.243 --> 04:07:01.993
Then you'll have to sign a paper

04:07:02.028 --> 04:07:03.743
saying this house will remain mine.

04:07:03.778 --> 04:07:06.167
Attila! Attila, look!

04:07:06.202 --> 04:07:08.743
You got that mortgage
from my husband with threats,

04:07:08.778 --> 04:07:10.868
with political blackmail!

04:07:11.368 --> 04:07:13.833
You-- You made his heart give out.

04:07:13.868 --> 04:07:16.333
You tormented the poor man
until he died.

04:07:16.368 --> 04:07:20.167
"It's all so artistic,
as if you were abroad."

04:07:20.202 --> 04:07:25.202
Made to order for a high party official,
isn't it, Mr. Black Shirt?

04:07:25.237 --> 04:07:29.410
But now I've got you trapped
and I'll not let you go.

04:07:29.445 --> 04:07:31.375
You're not leaving here.

04:07:31.410 --> 04:07:34.118
This house is mine
and it'll stay mine.

04:07:35.077 --> 04:07:36.077
"Made in...

04:07:37.868 --> 04:07:39.535
"Czechoslovakia."

04:07:41.743 --> 04:07:44.417
Sinners. Rogues.

04:07:44.452 --> 04:07:47.410
Concubine! Concubine!

04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:51.250
You see? I told you.
She called you a concubine.

04:07:51.285 --> 04:07:55.285
If we don't get married soon, we'll be
the laughingstock of the whole countryside.

04:07:56.285 --> 04:07:58.202
The radio doesn't work.

04:08:03.077 --> 04:08:05.077
You've harmed me for the last time.

04:08:07.577 --> 04:08:09.577
What has my poor cat done to you?

04:08:10.577 --> 04:08:12.577
Murderers.

04:08:13.077 --> 04:08:15.577
That's what you are, murderers.

04:08:17.785 --> 04:08:21.160
Murderers! Murderers! Murderers!

04:08:39.285 --> 04:08:40.785
Murderers.

04:08:41.785 --> 04:08:43.285
Murderers.

04:08:46.160 --> 04:08:47.125
Murderers.

04:08:47.160 --> 04:08:50.625
<i>Signora</i> Pioppi, calm down.

04:08:50.660 --> 04:08:54.160
Open the door.
You're really hysterical.

04:08:55.202 --> 04:08:56.368
What are you talking about?

04:08:58.160 --> 04:09:01.625
All these silly accusations.

04:09:01.660 --> 04:09:05.660
If you just open the door,
we can talk it over.

04:09:09.160 --> 04:09:12.368
We're respectable people,
<i>Signora</i> Pioppi.

04:09:22.368 --> 04:09:24.868
Admit it, I look nice
in the coalman's hat.

04:09:25.368 --> 04:09:27.868
Ah, you look irresistible.

04:09:27.903 --> 04:09:29.667
Yes.

04:09:29.702 --> 04:09:31.535
But I prefer you in my hat.

04:09:51.743 --> 04:09:54.077
Who are these people?

04:09:54.577 --> 04:09:57.160
Oh, they must be coming
from midnight Mass.

04:10:04.202 --> 04:10:05.577
What's going on?

04:10:11.285 --> 04:10:12.667
A robbery.

04:10:12.702 --> 04:10:14.702
What was there to rob?
She was full of debts.

04:10:14.737 --> 04:10:16.702
Poor people.
They had to mortgage everything,

04:10:16.737 --> 04:10:18.719
the land, the villa, everything.

04:10:18.754 --> 04:10:20.702
Who has the mortgage?

04:10:20.737 --> 04:10:22.202
Oh, my God!

04:10:26.993 --> 04:10:29.702
Everything she owned is mortgaged
to Alfredo Berlinghieri.

04:10:29.737 --> 04:10:31.993
What do mortgages
have to do with it?

04:10:32.028 --> 04:10:34.250
This was obviously a sex crime.

04:10:34.285 --> 04:10:36.556
She was still a very handsome woman.

04:10:36.591 --> 04:10:38.827
She undoubtedly had some relationship.

04:10:40.827 --> 04:10:42.597
Merry Christmas. <i>Signorina.</i>

04:10:42.632 --> 04:10:44.368
Good evening, Commissioner.

04:10:58.577 --> 04:11:01.042
Mortgages.

04:11:01.077 --> 04:11:05.243
I wouldn't be surprised if this weren't
the act of a crazed, jealous lover.

04:11:06.243 --> 04:11:10.243
It could be anyone,
possibly someone right here.

04:11:10.278 --> 04:11:12.243
She probably led him on,

04:11:14.327 --> 04:11:15.827
then spurned him.

04:11:17.327 --> 04:11:19.327
With his lust aroused,

04:11:20.827 --> 04:11:22.827
he possibly raped her.

04:11:24.827 --> 04:11:26.327
Then this murder.

04:11:27.827 --> 04:11:32.410
Maniacs. Communists. Perverts.

04:11:33.952 --> 04:11:35.577
May I take a look?

04:11:40.868 --> 04:11:42.868
There, you see?
No underwear.

04:11:44.868 --> 04:11:47.868
Why does a woman
take off her underwear? Huh?

04:11:48.368 --> 04:11:49.368
Why?

04:11:53.618 --> 04:11:54.618
Coward.

04:11:55.618 --> 04:11:56.660
Coward.

04:12:08.327 --> 04:12:10.827
Ada! Ada!

04:12:24.660 --> 04:12:26.660
Olmo! Olmo!

04:12:28.695 --> 04:12:30.160
Olmo!

04:12:33.660 --> 04:12:34.660
Olmo!

04:12:38.160 --> 04:12:40.660
What is this? Why do you have a lock?
What do you have to hide?

04:12:40.695 --> 04:12:42.160
Why do you lock yourself in?

04:12:42.195 --> 04:12:43.660
I lock others out.

04:12:43.695 --> 04:12:45.160
Where's my wife?

04:12:57.577 --> 04:12:59.125
Oh.

04:12:59.160 --> 04:13:01.660
That's enough!
Get out of here!

04:13:01.695 --> 04:13:03.160
- Olmo!
- Get out of here.

04:13:05.660 --> 04:13:08.160
- I'm sorry. I--
- Get out of here!

04:13:09.160 --> 04:13:10.660
- What's he want?
- His wife.

04:13:11.160 --> 04:13:13.160
Shh! You'll wake up the children.

04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:28.910
I'm sorry. I-- I don't know
what's the matter with me.

04:13:28.945 --> 04:13:29.910
I don't know, I'm not feeling well.

04:13:30.410 --> 04:13:31.910
I think I have a heart condition.
Feel my heart.

04:13:31.945 --> 04:13:34.410
What heart?
You're just sick in the head.

04:13:38.410 --> 04:13:40.375
Oh, maybe you're right.
I don't know.

04:13:40.410 --> 04:13:43.910
I'm going crazy. Ada's gone.
I don't know where she is now.

04:13:43.945 --> 04:13:45.910
And you come looking
for her in my bed?

04:13:45.945 --> 04:13:48.375
What's so wrong about that? Huh?

04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:49.910
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

04:13:49.945 --> 04:13:51.327
- Go on.
- You know what I mean.

04:13:51.362 --> 04:13:52.792
Go on!

04:13:52.827 --> 04:13:55.327
Oh, I think it's very,
very, very possible

04:13:55.362 --> 04:13:56.827
because I think you like her.

04:13:56.862 --> 04:13:58.327
Yeah.

04:13:59.327 --> 04:14:00.577
You're right.

04:14:04.702 --> 04:14:06.702
And, uh, she likes me.

04:14:09.702 --> 04:14:12.952
We fuck and fuck,
fuck all the night.

04:14:12.987 --> 04:14:16.202
But it's not enough for her,
not enough.

04:14:18.702 --> 04:14:22.702
It seems she wants to, uh,
stuff this salami up her ass.

04:14:23.702 --> 04:14:24.702
Huh?

04:14:26.202 --> 04:14:28.327
Oh, Olmo, stop acting like a pig.

04:14:28.362 --> 04:14:29.792
You're really not funny.

04:14:29.827 --> 04:14:31.827
I don't understand
how you could talk like that.

04:14:32.327 --> 04:14:35.702
If you knew what I was going
through tonight, you wouldn't.

04:14:41.327 --> 04:14:44.292
They killed that wretched widow, Pioppi.

04:14:44.327 --> 04:14:47.327
There's such violence here.
It's all around us.

04:14:52.827 --> 04:14:54.660
I don't know.

04:14:55.077 --> 04:14:57.577
It would have to happen tonight,
just as Ada and I were finally able to talk.

04:14:58.077 --> 04:15:00.077
We were so close after so long.

04:15:00.112 --> 04:15:02.042
It was just like in the beginning.

04:15:02.077 --> 04:15:05.077
She saw all that blood
and she ran away.

04:15:05.112 --> 04:15:07.042
As if it were my fault.
I mean,

04:15:07.077 --> 04:15:08.577
I don't know what I had
to do with it.

04:15:09.577 --> 04:15:11.077
Who gets the widow's house?

04:15:11.112 --> 04:15:12.542
Huh?

04:15:12.577 --> 04:15:13.577
The property?

04:15:16.077 --> 04:15:18.577
They'll imprison some poor devil
who's done nothing.

04:15:19.577 --> 04:15:22.208
Call him a communist.

04:15:22.243 --> 04:15:25.785
There are too many innocent people
who have died, Alfredo.

04:15:25.820 --> 04:15:28.677
And you'll soon see more
and more and more.

04:15:28.712 --> 04:15:31.373
And there are too many in jail.
And it's you.

04:15:31.408 --> 04:15:34.035
It's you and others like you
who wanted it.

04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:35.452
It's you.

04:15:46.535 --> 04:15:48.035
I'm happy you have
a woman in the house.

04:15:48.070 --> 04:15:49.618
Your daughter needs a mother.

04:15:52.118 --> 04:15:53.910
She only came for Christmas.

04:15:57.618 --> 04:16:01.083
Her husband is in jail.

04:16:01.118 --> 04:16:04.118
Has it never occurred to you why so many
of your friends are in jail and not you?

04:16:04.153 --> 04:16:08.160
You, of all people, who should have
been the first to end up inside?

04:16:08.195 --> 04:16:10.552
Because I have stopped Attila,
that's why.

04:16:10.587 --> 04:16:12.910
Because I have made him
drop his bone.

04:16:14.910 --> 04:16:16.708
If you protect me,
it's been in your interest.

04:16:16.743 --> 04:16:21.077
Oh, that's right.
Go on, insult me. Insult your old friend.

04:16:21.577 --> 04:16:23.618
If I protect you,
it's because I care about you.

04:16:23.653 --> 04:16:24.583
Hmm.

04:16:24.618 --> 04:16:26.583
Don't you remember
we used to catch frogs together?

04:16:26.618 --> 04:16:29.993
You remember how beautiful it was
along the ditches in the summer, huh?

04:16:30.493 --> 04:16:32.493
I caught the frogs, you ate them.

04:16:33.577 --> 04:16:35.542
Come on.

04:16:35.577 --> 04:16:39.077
Come on, you hole-in-the-pocket socialist.

04:16:39.112 --> 04:16:40.535
Don't you remember anything?

04:16:40.570 --> 04:16:42.035
Hmm.

04:16:42.535 --> 04:16:44.035
Yes, yes, I remember.

04:16:46.035 --> 04:16:47.743
I remember your wedding day.

04:16:48.743 --> 04:16:52.542
And I remember I was beaten up.

04:16:52.577 --> 04:16:55.368
And I remember you stood and watched.

04:16:56.785 --> 04:16:59.285
You also remember when you broke
into my father's house

04:16:59.320 --> 04:17:01.750
and when you stole his gun?

04:17:01.785 --> 04:17:04.577
And if you're so courageous,
why haven't you ever used it?

04:17:04.612 --> 04:17:07.077
To get killed?
Is that what you want?

04:17:14.910 --> 04:17:16.910
Enough talk, Alfredo.

04:17:16.945 --> 04:17:17.910
Mmm.

04:17:22.410 --> 04:17:24.910
Go home.
You'll find Ada there.

04:17:26.910 --> 04:17:28.410
You really think so?

04:17:28.445 --> 04:17:29.410
Sure, sure.

04:17:37.410 --> 04:17:38.910
Take this, just in case.

04:17:43.410 --> 04:17:45.910
Ah, stick it up yours!

04:18:58.618 --> 04:18:59.618
Ada?

04:19:13.577 --> 04:19:16.042
Ada? Ada.

04:19:16.077 --> 04:19:19.077
Ada, open the door.
Are you all right?

04:19:19.112 --> 04:19:21.535
Say something. Ada! Ada!

04:19:22.535 --> 04:19:24.743
Open the door or I'll break it down.

04:19:26.160 --> 04:19:29.160
Ada? Ada, are you all right?

04:19:29.195 --> 04:19:31.625
Are you all right, Ada?

04:19:31.660 --> 04:19:34.660
Ada, say something at least.

04:19:35.660 --> 04:19:38.660
It's not my fault, Ada.
Please, open up.

04:19:40.160 --> 04:19:42.125
It's not my fault.

04:19:42.160 --> 04:19:44.160
Listen, we'll take a trip.
We'll go to Paris.

04:19:44.660 --> 04:19:45.660
Wouldn't you like to do that?

04:19:46.160 --> 04:19:48.868
We can leave tomorrow.
We can even leave now if you want.

04:19:49.868 --> 04:19:54.000
We'll have a child.
We'll have a child!

04:19:54.035 --> 04:19:57.327
<i>The most recent communiqué
from an Axis Army...</i>

04:19:57.362 --> 04:19:59.868
I've just seen Aunt Ada.

04:20:00.368 --> 04:20:02.833
Be a good girl now.
Come, I made it sweet for you.

04:20:02.868 --> 04:20:06.368
- Just the way you like it.
- Nicolo, come have your lunch.

04:20:06.403 --> 04:20:07.368
Come on.

04:20:08.868 --> 04:20:10.333
One more like a good girl.

04:20:10.368 --> 04:20:13.368
<i>The allied forces are fighting desperately
to keep their hold</i>

04:20:13.403 --> 04:20:15.333
<i>on the Kasserine Pass.</i>

04:20:15.368 --> 04:20:17.833
<i>With the help of Italo-German air power,</i>

04:20:17.868 --> 04:20:21.952
<i>our gallant soldiers have breached
the pass in several places,</i>

04:20:22.452 --> 04:20:25.952
<i>turning northward in the direction
of Tébessa and Thala.</i>

04:20:25.987 --> 04:20:29.327
So, you saw your Auntie Ada?

04:20:30.285 --> 04:20:32.660
I mean it. I mean it.

04:20:33.160 --> 04:20:34.660
Don't talk nonsense.

04:20:36.160 --> 04:20:38.993
Ada is dead.
Dead, dead, dead.

04:20:39.493 --> 04:20:43.243
Why do you say she's dead?

04:20:43.278 --> 04:20:46.993
She's in a room.
Caged beast.

04:20:47.493 --> 04:20:49.458
She eats the hearts of bad children.

04:20:49.493 --> 04:20:53.202
<i>...and 66 heavy artillery pieces
of various caliber.</i>

04:21:09.660 --> 04:21:11.660
Hey!

04:21:12.993 --> 04:21:14.958
Hey!

04:21:14.993 --> 04:21:17.458
<i>Hail</i> the <i>Duce,</i> people.

04:21:17.493 --> 04:21:20.493
This is what is known
as the fascist miracle.

04:21:20.528 --> 04:21:22.958
We don't need those cart horses anymore.

04:21:22.993 --> 04:21:25.493
- We put the power of 50 horses in one machine.
- They're sold, did you hear?

04:21:25.528 --> 04:21:26.993
Time's up.

04:21:30.493 --> 04:21:32.958
Hey, Barone!

04:21:32.993 --> 04:21:35.993
Barone, what's the use
of those cart horses?

04:21:36.028 --> 04:21:37.993
Unless you got a stable hand.

04:21:38.993 --> 04:21:40.827
You need a stable hand, Barone?

04:21:44.118 --> 04:21:46.451
Seems fit. Any family?

04:21:50.118 --> 04:21:53.077
Widower. One daughter.

04:22:01.410 --> 04:22:03.952
It all depends.
How much are you selling them for?

04:22:03.987 --> 04:22:06.952
Barone, I give you
the best deal in the world.

04:22:13.952 --> 04:22:17.202
Barone's a good man.
You'll be very happy with him.

04:22:22.535 --> 04:22:24.535
So I'm sold, too?

04:22:25.535 --> 04:22:27.500
Part of the contract.

04:22:27.535 --> 04:22:30.785
Horses, horseman, horse manure.

04:22:32.077 --> 04:22:33.868
You all hear? I was sold.

04:22:36.077 --> 04:22:38.577
To that merchant there.
Stupid beast!

04:22:47.493 --> 04:22:50.952
I can't be milked, though.
Or be fed with hay.

04:22:51.368 --> 04:22:53.702
I can't provide milk
or make a meal of grain.

04:22:53.737 --> 04:22:55.702
For I'm not a beast.

04:22:57.702 --> 04:23:00.000
Only a peasant.

04:23:00.035 --> 04:23:02.910
A peasant like-- like you men.
Understand?

04:23:06.910 --> 04:23:08.410
Can they buy us for nothing?

04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:11.368
Is a peasant for sale?

04:23:12.368 --> 04:23:13.618
Is it just?

04:23:24.535 --> 04:23:26.167
Well, tell me, is it just?

04:23:26.202 --> 04:23:28.202
Olmo, tie the horses
to the back of the motorcycle,

04:23:28.237 --> 04:23:29.702
get your daughter, and get going.

04:23:35.410 --> 04:23:36.785
Horse manure!

04:23:53.868 --> 04:23:55.868
Horses go in horse manure!

04:23:58.035 --> 04:24:01.000
Shit! Shit!
Let it out.

04:24:01.035 --> 04:24:05.285
Don't hold back, for God's sake, shit!
I'm gonna wait, come on.

04:24:08.577 --> 04:24:10.660
What about <i>Il Duce?</i>

04:24:10.695 --> 04:24:12.708
He's full of shit, too!

04:24:12.743 --> 04:24:14.993
God bless us, a full behind.

04:24:15.028 --> 04:24:17.208
Look. Look at all the shit.

04:24:17.243 --> 04:24:20.077
The greatest load
of horse shit and dung.

04:24:28.160 --> 04:24:30.660
- It stinks.
- Here comes another load!

04:24:41.202 --> 04:24:43.708
Go ahead, everybody! Laugh!

04:24:43.743 --> 04:24:47.285
You little shit!
It's all right! It's all right!

04:24:47.535 --> 04:24:50.868
- Here, we can begin to change things.
- Hey, Barone!

04:24:50.903 --> 04:24:54.202
Make him eat it, Olmo!
Horse shit pie!

04:24:57.243 --> 04:25:00.243
Milk and wine give you lines.
Tell your <i>padrona.</i>

04:25:00.278 --> 04:25:03.243
Tell her milk on the tongue
keeps you young.

04:25:03.278 --> 04:25:04.410
Stupid.

04:25:06.910 --> 04:25:08.410
<i>Ciao,</i> Teresita.

04:25:20.410 --> 04:25:21.910
Hurry, Olmo, before it's too late.

04:25:21.945 --> 04:25:23.375
On your way, Olmo.

04:25:23.410 --> 04:25:25.410
- God knows what Attila will do.
- Olmo, there is no time.

04:25:27.410 --> 04:25:28.375
Yes.

04:25:28.410 --> 04:25:29.660
Stay away until
you're sure it's safe.

04:25:29.952 --> 04:25:31.243
Don't worry about the house.

04:25:31.278 --> 04:25:32.708
I want to go with you.

04:25:32.743 --> 04:25:33.743
No, it's better if you go to Stella's.

04:25:34.077 --> 04:25:35.292
- Please.
- Be good. Be good.

04:25:35.327 --> 04:25:36.792
- Take me with you, please.
- You promised.

04:25:36.827 --> 04:25:39.368
All right, take the key.
Take the key. It's yours.

04:25:41.160 --> 04:25:43.097
- All right. I'll come back.
- Yes.

04:25:43.132 --> 04:25:45.035
I'll come back.
I'll come back.

04:25:59.243 --> 04:26:01.243
Here, you need it more than I do.

04:26:01.278 --> 04:26:03.583
Thank you. Thank you.

04:26:03.618 --> 04:26:05.785
Now, listen, you'd better keep
your doors locked,

04:26:05.820 --> 04:26:07.785
and don't go out alone.

04:26:09.285 --> 04:26:10.535
- Thank you.
- <i>Ciao,</i> Olmo.

04:26:11.035 --> 04:26:13.000
- Goodbye, Olmo. Come back soon.
- <i>Ciao.</i>

04:26:13.035 --> 04:26:15.202
- Take care of yourself, Olmo.
- Yes. Be prepared for the worst.

04:26:15.237 --> 04:26:18.868
- You carry our blessings.
- Write to us. Send us word.

04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:21.389
Let us know how you are.

04:26:21.424 --> 04:26:22.833
Good luck, Olmo.

04:26:22.868 --> 04:26:25.542
Here, Olmo, take this.
Goodbye. Be careful.

04:26:25.577 --> 04:26:27.452
We'll see you soon.
Don't let them get you, Olmo.

04:26:27.487 --> 04:26:29.452
Good luck, Olmo.

04:27:00.160 --> 04:27:03.160
<i>Signora</i> Ada,
I have a new story for you.

04:27:03.195 --> 04:27:04.660
- And today it's a true story.
- Wait.

04:27:04.695 --> 04:27:06.910
Wait. Wait.

04:27:16.910 --> 04:27:19.410
What happened was Attila
wanted to sell Olmo.

04:27:19.445 --> 04:27:21.375
- Sell Olmo?
- Yes.

04:27:21.410 --> 04:27:24.910
Attila bought a new tractor for the farm
and was showing off.

04:27:24.945 --> 04:27:26.375
And so then he said
horsemen are finished,

04:27:26.410 --> 04:27:29.660
and if it'd be of any use,
he'd sell Olmo along with the horses.

04:27:29.695 --> 04:27:31.198
Nobody helped Olmo?

04:27:31.233 --> 04:27:32.702
Yeah, they all did.

04:27:38.243 --> 04:27:40.702
And then you know what happened?
It began to rain.

04:27:41.202 --> 04:27:42.667
- What?
- Yeah,

04:27:42.702 --> 04:27:43.702
it rained horse manure.

04:27:44.202 --> 04:27:46.202
Horse manure, all over Attila. Ah!

04:27:46.702 --> 04:27:48.452
His nose, his eyes.
All over.

04:27:48.487 --> 04:27:50.202
Even on his bald head.

04:27:50.237 --> 04:27:51.667
On Regina, too?

04:27:51.702 --> 04:27:53.667
No, but they'd have gotten her, too,
had she been there.

04:27:53.702 --> 04:27:57.702
Then they massaged all the horses' asses
and got a lot of fresh shit.

04:27:57.737 --> 04:28:00.667
And after that,
Attila smelled like a pigsty.

04:28:00.702 --> 04:28:03.702
But then, all of a sudden,
the farmers were scared,

04:28:03.737 --> 04:28:06.202
and Olmo left on his bicycle.

04:28:07.702 --> 04:28:09.702
- Olmo ran away?
- Yeah.

04:28:10.202 --> 04:28:12.167
Attila will come with his fascists.

04:28:12.202 --> 04:28:14.202
Everyone cried when Olmo left, <i>signora.</i>

04:28:14.702 --> 04:28:16.702
But he wanted to go.
He was free. Don't you understand?

04:28:16.737 --> 04:28:19.219
- No, he was sad.
- Oh, you're stupid.

04:28:19.254 --> 04:28:21.667
You're in a fog.
He was happy.

04:28:21.702 --> 04:28:25.202
Poor Olmo had to leave his daughter

04:28:25.237 --> 04:28:27.702
and had to leave his house.

04:28:27.737 --> 04:28:29.702
He wasn't glad at all.

04:28:32.702 --> 04:28:34.327
What do you know?
You know nothing.

04:28:34.362 --> 04:28:36.344
You're leaving, too, <i>signora?</i>

04:28:36.379 --> 04:28:38.327
I'm leaving, yes.
And for good.

04:28:38.827 --> 04:28:40.618
Everybody's going.

04:28:46.285 --> 04:28:47.785
I won't need these.

04:28:48.660 --> 04:28:50.160
You can have them.

04:29:05.077 --> 04:29:08.327
This, too. Here, take this.

04:29:11.202 --> 04:29:12.410
And this.

04:29:14.118 --> 04:29:15.660
And this.

04:29:16.118 --> 04:29:17.493
This.

04:29:20.493 --> 04:29:22.118
Here, take this.

04:29:25.452 --> 04:29:26.452
<i>Signora,</i>

04:29:29.952 --> 04:29:31.952
could I have a kiss, too?

04:29:32.952 --> 04:29:34.452
Come here.

04:30:32.160 --> 04:30:33.577
Anthony!

04:30:34.577 --> 04:30:35.952
Anthony!

04:30:46.577 --> 04:30:47.660
Attila!

04:30:48.660 --> 04:30:50.160
Attila!

04:30:55.660 --> 04:30:56.993
Attila!

04:30:58.952 --> 04:31:01.160
Come down here immediately!

04:31:06.077 --> 04:31:08.077
Anthony, there are books
in the other room.

04:31:08.112 --> 04:31:09.577
Right away.

04:31:15.160 --> 04:31:16.660
Attila!

04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:23.333
<i>Signor</i> Alfredo, you've heard about it.
The bastard's run off to--

04:31:23.368 --> 04:31:26.368
Who asked you to come here?
Who gave you the right to do this?

04:31:26.403 --> 04:31:27.833
Right?
He's a communist organizer.

04:31:27.868 --> 04:31:29.868
I don't care if he's a communist or not,
he's a friend of mine.

04:31:29.903 --> 04:31:31.833
A friend of yours?

04:31:31.868 --> 04:31:35.035
That friend stole this gun
from your father 15 years ago. Look.

04:31:35.070 --> 04:31:37.500
It's taken you
a long time to find it.

04:31:37.535 --> 04:31:40.535
I would have found it sooner
if I'd been allowed to do my job.

04:31:42.327 --> 04:31:46.160
You've done your job.
Your services are no longer needed here.

04:31:46.195 --> 04:31:47.660
What?

04:31:49.285 --> 04:31:51.785
Listen, everybody, I fired him.

04:31:51.820 --> 04:31:53.750
I fired the foreman.

04:31:53.785 --> 04:31:55.785
Can you hear me?
I fired Attila.

04:32:04.202 --> 04:32:06.333
Ada, it's me.

04:32:06.368 --> 04:32:07.667
I'm sorry.
I know I shouldn't be here,

04:32:07.702 --> 04:32:10.535
but I have something
very important to tell you.

04:32:10.570 --> 04:32:12.535
I know you're going
to be very happy.

04:32:19.327 --> 04:32:21.827
I've done it.
I've fired Attila.

04:32:21.862 --> 04:32:23.077
It's over.

04:32:28.285 --> 04:32:29.785
She's gone, <i>padrone.</i> Gone.

04:32:29.820 --> 04:32:31.750
Gone?

04:32:31.785 --> 04:32:34.285
- Where did she go?
- She won't return anymore.

04:32:34.320 --> 04:32:35.802
- Where did she go?
- No more.

04:32:35.837 --> 04:32:37.561
- Where did she go?
- No more.

04:32:37.596 --> 04:32:39.285
- Where did she go?
- No more.

04:32:47.285 --> 04:32:50.452
She said you'd understand
if I dressed up in this.

04:32:58.202 --> 04:32:59.452
Swim!

04:33:11.827 --> 04:33:13.243
Take a look!
Take a look!

04:33:13.743 --> 04:33:16.243
You're all gonna end up like that!
Like sewer rats!

04:33:17.952 --> 04:33:19.952
Go on, scream, you shit!

04:33:25.993 --> 04:33:28.368
Cover his face in it!

04:33:35.118 --> 04:33:36.493
Orio!

04:33:37.368 --> 04:33:38.993
Orio!

04:33:45.702 --> 04:33:47.202
Oh, he's dead.

04:33:50.368 --> 04:33:51.833
Breasts.
Unrighteous breasts.

04:33:51.868 --> 04:33:54.368
- You filthy rotten fascist!
- Cover yourself, you dirty bitch.

04:33:54.403 --> 04:33:55.868
- Cover up!
- Here, fire it, bastard!

04:33:55.903 --> 04:33:58.452
Pig! Bastard! Pig!

04:34:07.202 --> 04:34:09.035
All right, turn back.

04:34:11.785 --> 04:34:13.285
Temesio!

04:34:13.320 --> 04:34:14.750
Oh?

04:34:14.785 --> 04:34:16.868
Temesio, does God exist?

04:34:16.903 --> 04:34:18.385
No!

04:34:18.420 --> 04:34:19.833
Attila!

04:34:19.868 --> 04:34:23.368
Does that bastard Mussolini exist?

04:34:23.403 --> 04:34:24.885
- Temesio?
- Oh?

04:34:24.920 --> 04:34:26.368
Does <i>Il Duce</i> exist?

04:34:26.785 --> 04:34:27.750
No!

04:34:27.785 --> 04:34:29.285
The <i>Duce</i> doesn't exist!

04:34:29.320 --> 04:34:30.615
Kill him.

04:34:32.910 --> 04:34:35.250
You move and I'll kill you.

04:34:35.285 --> 04:34:39.535
Attila. Neither do you exist, Attila.

04:35:15.410 --> 04:35:17.910
Stop that whistling.
Stop it.

04:35:22.743 --> 04:35:24.993
I can kill all of you
whenever I want to

04:35:25.028 --> 04:35:27.243
so you can whistle
till your mouths rot.

04:35:27.278 --> 04:35:29.743
I don't give a damn
for any of you.

04:35:29.778 --> 04:35:32.042
Anthony.

04:35:32.077 --> 04:35:33.493
Let's get out of here.

04:35:34.493 --> 04:35:36.625
You're shit! Scum!

04:35:36.660 --> 04:35:39.660
You're a disgrace
to the Italian nation.

04:35:39.695 --> 04:35:42.160
You are the shit of Italy!

04:36:27.452 --> 04:36:29.452
Fight, comrades,
in the name of Stalin.

04:36:29.952 --> 04:36:31.452
The Black Shirt bandits are here.

04:36:31.487 --> 04:36:32.917
Come on, everyone, over here.

04:36:32.952 --> 04:36:35.952
Let's wipe them out,
rip their guts.

04:36:35.987 --> 04:36:37.452
Every last one of them.

04:36:40.327 --> 04:36:42.785
Here, Manzalone,
they're just beyond the canal.

04:36:42.820 --> 04:36:44.410
Grab these, go on.

04:36:50.368 --> 04:36:53.868
- Hurry up!
- Kill every one of them.

04:37:05.952 --> 04:37:08.333
Anita!

04:37:08.368 --> 04:37:11.993
Anita, what can you see there?

04:37:12.028 --> 04:37:13.493
I can see...

04:37:14.493 --> 04:37:16.958
I can see...

04:37:16.993 --> 04:37:20.243
I can see a bunch of fascists.
They're running away.

04:37:20.278 --> 04:37:23.493
One of our men's running after them.
He's alone.

04:37:23.528 --> 04:37:25.375
- Anita...
- Eh?

04:37:25.410 --> 04:37:28.285
I'll bet it's my Wildcat.
God bless him.

04:37:30.285 --> 04:37:31.250
Oh.

04:37:31.285 --> 04:37:33.250
He's only got a stick

04:37:33.285 --> 04:37:37.035
but, by God, he's giving it to them.

04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:39.469
He's really giving it to them.

04:37:39.504 --> 04:37:41.868
If you could only see them, women!

04:37:41.903 --> 04:37:44.125
Come on, harder!

04:37:44.160 --> 04:37:46.833
Harder now! Kill them all!

04:37:46.868 --> 04:37:50.792
Have you lost your tongues?
Shout, women, shout!

04:37:50.827 --> 04:37:54.327
Let our men hear us!
Come on, shout!

04:37:54.362 --> 04:37:55.827
- You kill him.
- Louder!

04:37:57.327 --> 04:37:58.792
Louder!

04:38:01.160 --> 04:38:04.250
Blessed are the young
who see what isn't there.

04:38:04.285 --> 04:38:09.118
Hundreds of German soldiers are running off,
leaving for good.

04:38:09.153 --> 04:38:11.118
If you could only see this, too.

04:38:11.153 --> 04:38:13.083
They'll never come back.

04:38:13.118 --> 04:38:16.993
They're throwing away
their guns and their uniforms.

04:38:17.785 --> 04:38:19.285
Oh, God.

04:38:21.077 --> 04:38:22.910
What do you see?
What is it?

04:38:22.945 --> 04:38:25.386
A huge cloud of dust.

04:38:25.421 --> 04:38:27.827
A man on a white horse.

04:38:27.862 --> 04:38:29.827
He looks like...

04:38:29.862 --> 04:38:31.785
Like Olmo.

04:38:33.785 --> 04:38:35.743
If only it was Olmo.

04:38:35.778 --> 04:38:37.702
Let his soul be at rest.

04:38:41.410 --> 04:38:43.910
Attila and Regina.

04:38:46.910 --> 04:38:49.202
Attila and Regina!

04:38:56.952 --> 04:38:59.077
Shoot, Attila!
Shoot!

04:39:48.160 --> 04:39:49.660
Bitches!

04:39:49.695 --> 04:39:52.160
Stinking bastard!

04:40:08.743 --> 04:40:10.000
Kill her!

04:40:10.035 --> 04:40:11.743
Throw her in the shit!

04:40:11.778 --> 04:40:14.077
Die, you fascist cow!

04:40:14.112 --> 04:40:16.000
Fascist pig!

04:40:16.035 --> 04:40:17.500
- Kill her!
- Move, women.

04:40:17.535 --> 04:40:19.785
Move out of the way.
Let's take them to the sty.

04:40:19.820 --> 04:40:21.785
Put this shit with the other pigs!

04:40:25.118 --> 04:40:26.910
Now you know what a pigsty is like!

04:40:44.493 --> 04:40:46.618
No, you can't come through.

04:40:47.118 --> 04:40:48.535
You can't come through.

04:40:51.118 --> 04:40:53.368
The sty is too good for them!

04:40:58.618 --> 04:41:01.000
Hey, Comrade!

04:41:01.035 --> 04:41:04.535
Is it true you're giving the land
to those who'll work it?

04:41:04.570 --> 04:41:06.417
Who is she?

04:41:06.452 --> 04:41:09.327
- Have you ever seen her?
- I've never seen her.

04:41:09.362 --> 04:41:12.202
I said, is it true you're giving the land
to those who'll work it?

04:41:13.535 --> 04:41:16.035
Yes. Come on!
Come on!

04:41:18.660 --> 04:41:20.625
Let's go.

04:41:20.660 --> 04:41:22.160
Come on, you blockheads.

04:41:24.160 --> 04:41:26.625
Oh, how many there are.

04:41:26.660 --> 04:41:29.792
Who-- Who are you?
No one knows you,

04:41:29.827 --> 04:41:33.056
and yet you speak words
we've always wanted to hear.

04:41:33.091 --> 04:41:36.285
This man is Carnellio,
and I am Rondina, his wife.

04:41:36.320 --> 04:41:38.285
We come from the mountains.

04:41:38.785 --> 04:41:42.285
The Nazis, they burned everything,
all our houses.

04:41:42.320 --> 04:41:45.875
And the fascists,
they took all our goods.

04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:48.868
I say, first of all,
we have to give them a place to sleep.

04:41:48.903 --> 04:41:51.493
Best let us sleep inside the sheds here.

04:41:51.528 --> 04:41:54.250
No, the shed is for vagabonds.

04:41:54.285 --> 04:41:56.577
And the house is where comrades stay.

04:41:56.612 --> 04:41:58.577
Pigsties are for the fascists.

04:42:12.077 --> 04:42:13.202
Everything will be fine.

04:42:14.202 --> 04:42:16.702
<i>So glad that I shall die</i>

04:42:17.202 --> 04:42:19.167
<i>And yet I'm sorry</i>

04:42:19.202 --> 04:42:21.702
<i>I'm so sorry that I die</i>

04:42:21.737 --> 04:42:24.202
<i>So I won't worry</i>

04:42:26.202 --> 04:42:28.577
Shut up, you gravedigger!

04:42:29.077 --> 04:42:31.542
Who goes there?

04:42:31.577 --> 04:42:34.577
The people's committee
for community swine allotment.

04:42:35.577 --> 04:42:36.577
Oh!

04:42:37.077 --> 04:42:38.577
More pigs than I ever saw.

04:42:44.577 --> 04:42:46.577
Come here, my beauty.

04:42:46.612 --> 04:42:48.577
Oh, let me kiss you.

04:42:50.077 --> 04:42:52.917
Come, another.
I need another kiss.

04:42:52.952 --> 04:42:55.618
Oh, let me touch you,
you're so beautiful.

04:42:55.653 --> 04:42:57.625
Let me get on you.

04:42:57.660 --> 04:43:00.910
- I want to spend the whole night...
- Can't you show pity?

04:43:00.945 --> 04:43:03.577
Bastards! Bastards!

04:43:04.077 --> 04:43:06.618
13, 14, 15,

04:43:07.118 --> 04:43:09.118
16, 17, 18.

04:43:09.618 --> 04:43:11.667
And with those two sitting there, it's 20.

04:43:11.702 --> 04:43:14.743
Just a moment, comrades.
My heart's heavy in me.

04:43:15.243 --> 04:43:17.743
Abolishing the <i>padrone's</i> rights
will make me feel 100% better,

04:43:17.778 --> 04:43:19.490
I can tell you that.

04:43:19.525 --> 04:43:21.363
Then I guess we must be idiots, eh.

04:43:21.398 --> 04:43:23.300
Nobody can make out
what you're saying.

04:43:23.335 --> 04:43:25.202
Take a look at all these pigs in here.

04:43:25.702 --> 04:43:29.743
Prosciutto, salami, sausage,
feet and knuckles, and lard,

04:43:29.778 --> 04:43:32.469
and mortadella.
Who do they belong to now?

04:43:32.504 --> 04:43:35.160
Listen here,
you'll own all the animals.

04:43:35.195 --> 04:43:37.042
Socialism can bring it all to you.

04:43:37.077 --> 04:43:41.472
How do I know that socialism
is really going to feed me?

04:43:41.507 --> 04:43:45.868
And what my heart is heavy for
is those two souls there.

04:43:45.903 --> 04:43:47.827
All the Dalcos step forward.

04:43:50.452 --> 04:43:52.952
You others from the mountains
ruled by priests,

04:43:52.987 --> 04:43:54.719
instead of wallowing in ignorance,

04:43:54.754 --> 04:43:56.452
try beating your head three times

04:43:56.487 --> 04:43:58.917
to let in socialist ideas.

04:43:58.952 --> 04:44:01.535
- What do you want to do?
- You heard him.

04:44:01.570 --> 04:44:04.083
So did you, about beating your head.

04:44:04.118 --> 04:44:06.118
Why beat our heads three times?
What did he mean?

04:44:06.153 --> 04:44:08.118
Beating your head makes no sense.

04:44:08.153 --> 04:44:09.802
Look at him.

04:44:09.837 --> 04:44:11.452
Look at him.

04:44:12.368 --> 04:44:13.333
Look at him.

04:44:13.368 --> 04:44:15.702
I can see you're a man of feeling.

04:44:17.202 --> 04:44:18.667
Help him.

04:44:18.702 --> 04:44:20.535
Don't you see he is dying like a pig?

04:44:20.570 --> 04:44:22.035
Help him.

04:44:22.535 --> 04:44:23.993
In the name of humanity.

04:44:53.618 --> 04:44:56.618
Look, right there is where
my grandfather's buried.

04:45:11.827 --> 04:45:14.292
"Patrizio Avanzini,

04:45:14.327 --> 04:45:18.827
"tender flower plucked
by the cruel hands of destiny."

04:45:20.327 --> 04:45:22.827
Cruel hands of destiny.

04:45:23.327 --> 04:45:25.327
Destiny's hands.

04:45:25.827 --> 04:45:27.327
My hands.

04:45:29.327 --> 04:45:31.327
The cruel hands of destiny.

04:45:36.362 --> 04:45:37.577
Regina.

04:45:38.577 --> 04:45:40.542
Regina.

04:45:40.577 --> 04:45:44.577
Our children will harvest the seeds
we have planted, Regina.

04:45:44.612 --> 04:45:46.077
You are as ugly as sin.

04:45:47.327 --> 04:45:49.160
- Get away!
- Don't cut her hair!

04:45:49.195 --> 04:45:51.160
Don't cut her hair!

04:45:55.068 --> 04:45:56.833
PIERO PIOPPI
DIED AS HONESTLY AS HE LIVED

04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:58.568
IDA CANTA ELLI widow of PIOPPI
GOOD AND SAINTLY WOMAN

04:45:58.603 --> 04:45:59.868
OFFENDED BY THE CRUELTY OF TIME

04:46:00.168 --> 04:46:03.500
"Canta Elli Pioppi.

04:46:03.535 --> 04:46:08.202
"Good and saintly woman,
offended by the cruelty of time."

04:46:08.535 --> 04:46:11.125
I am that cruel time.

04:46:11.160 --> 04:46:15.035
Me. I killed that crazy bitch.

04:46:18.035 --> 04:46:21.292
And that little turd, Patrizio.

04:46:21.327 --> 04:46:24.327
Me, Attila Mellanchini.

04:46:25.827 --> 04:46:27.327
Fascist.

04:46:28.785 --> 04:46:29.785
Man.

04:46:31.285 --> 04:46:32.785
Pigs.

04:46:34.285 --> 04:46:35.243
Scum.

04:46:36.535 --> 04:46:37.827
Shits.

04:46:39.285 --> 04:46:40.202
Turd.

04:46:45.702 --> 04:46:49.202
Stop that music!
This is not a dance hall!

04:46:49.237 --> 04:46:51.702
You have no respect for our dead!

04:47:30.243 --> 04:47:32.243
Look, everybody.

04:47:33.743 --> 04:47:36.292
Come here, everybody!

04:47:36.327 --> 04:47:38.327
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

04:47:42.827 --> 04:47:44.952
Kill me. Kill me!

04:47:45.077 --> 04:47:47.577
Kill me, quick.
Kill me.

04:47:48.077 --> 04:47:49.577
Kill me.

04:47:50.535 --> 04:47:51.792
Kill me!

04:47:51.827 --> 04:47:53.493
- Get away.
- Kill me.

04:48:21.993 --> 04:48:24.118
Be careful.
Watch from behind here.

04:48:40.785 --> 04:48:43.202
Don't look when a lady is pissing.

04:48:52.577 --> 04:48:54.243
<i>Halt.</i> No one can pass here.

04:48:54.743 --> 04:48:55.785
Go on.

04:49:00.327 --> 04:49:02.327
Who is that?
It's the <i>padrone.</i> He is my prisoner.

04:49:02.362 --> 04:49:04.327
Why are you holding him
here in this stall?

04:49:04.362 --> 04:49:06.327
I'm waiting for the partisans.

04:49:08.743 --> 04:49:11.243
It takes a pretty smart boy
to fool with such a gun.

04:50:01.202 --> 04:50:04.368
Go, Marina. You be the first one up.
Careful you don't fall.

04:50:04.403 --> 04:50:06.368
Paint out all the fascist slogans!

04:50:06.403 --> 04:50:07.917
Paint everything out!

04:50:07.952 --> 04:50:12.243
- Throw the paint on!
- Brush out. Brush out everything!

04:50:12.278 --> 04:50:14.993
No! No, wait!
That goose is mine!

04:50:15.028 --> 04:50:17.458
That's my goose!
It's mine!

04:50:17.493 --> 04:50:19.493
Where are you going?
Give it to me! Give it back!

04:50:19.993 --> 04:50:21.493
If it's yours,
then it's everybody's.

04:50:21.528 --> 04:50:22.958
It can't be yours
if it's everybody's.

04:50:22.993 --> 04:50:25.035
Did you have to pick mine
to be everybody's?

04:50:25.070 --> 04:50:27.535
Make it redder!
Put more red on!

04:50:47.327 --> 04:50:48.702
Stop tickling.

04:50:50.827 --> 04:50:52.160
Stupid ass.

04:50:53.410 --> 04:50:54.785
Cut it out.

04:51:01.660 --> 04:51:02.660
I'll kill you.

04:51:03.160 --> 04:51:04.125
Oh, will you look who's here?

04:51:04.160 --> 04:51:06.160
We forgot all about our <i>padrone.</i>

04:51:06.195 --> 04:51:08.125
Even forgot to arrest him.

04:51:08.160 --> 04:51:10.125
Good for you, Leonito.
Good boy.

04:51:10.160 --> 04:51:12.160
The children have more imagination
than we do.

04:51:34.660 --> 04:51:36.125
Oh, excuse me, <i>padrone,</i>

04:51:36.160 --> 04:51:38.160
I held my hand back so long,
it escaped on its own.

04:51:43.993 --> 04:51:45.993
And my foot escaped, too.

04:51:48.243 --> 04:51:50.917
Are you Olmo?

04:51:50.952 --> 04:51:52.535
I hand you my prisoner.

04:51:53.035 --> 04:51:54.493
Bravo.

04:52:02.618 --> 04:52:04.535
Hey, are you sleeping?

04:52:10.785 --> 04:52:13.285
Ada never came back, you know.

04:52:15.993 --> 04:52:18.201
You'd rather she were dead, huh?

04:52:18.236 --> 04:52:20.410
Well, at least you came back.

04:52:42.743 --> 04:52:44.952
Are you sure we hid it here?

04:52:50.827 --> 04:52:53.577
- I hereby declare...
- Give me the paint.

04:52:53.612 --> 04:52:56.292
the people's trial
of Alfredo Berlinghieri,

04:52:56.327 --> 04:53:00.118
<i>padrone</i> and therefore
enemy of the people, now open.

04:53:03.368 --> 04:53:07.243
I declare the people's trial
of the <i>padrone</i> open.

04:53:33.077 --> 04:53:35.577
- How did you know it was there?
- Because I hid it.

04:53:54.118 --> 04:53:57.618
I hereby declare the people's trial
of Alfredo Berlinghieri,

04:53:58.118 --> 04:54:01.118
<i>padrone</i> and therefore
enemy of the people, now open.

04:54:02.618 --> 04:54:05.083
Sit down here.
This is going to be good.

04:54:05.118 --> 04:54:08.618
My feet are killing me
but I don't want to miss the show.

04:54:16.077 --> 04:54:17.542
- Do you know when--
- She didn't come back

04:54:17.577 --> 04:54:19.077
because if she had,
she'd have stood trial with you.

04:54:19.112 --> 04:54:20.542
Do you know when she ran away?

04:54:20.577 --> 04:54:22.077
She ran away the day
that you ran away.

04:54:22.112 --> 04:54:23.917
She's cleverer than you.

04:54:23.952 --> 04:54:26.952
You stayed to be the <i>padrone</i>
right to the end.

04:54:32.535 --> 04:54:34.000
What are you writing, Anita?

04:54:34.035 --> 04:54:36.493
- We're not in school now.
- Give us a hand, Anita.

04:54:36.528 --> 04:54:38.917
This is a people's trial.
What's there to write?

04:54:38.952 --> 04:54:43.452
Comrades, what's done
is worthy of being written down,

04:54:43.487 --> 04:54:46.952
and what is written down
is worthy of being read.

04:54:46.987 --> 04:54:47.917
Just a minute.

04:54:47.952 --> 04:54:49.556
Oh, look at our flags!

04:54:49.591 --> 04:54:51.125
All our flags together!

04:54:51.160 --> 04:54:53.625
That one belonged to the
Workers' League, remember?

04:54:53.660 --> 04:54:57.660
Me and Rosina sewed them.
It got bigger every year.

04:54:58.660 --> 04:55:00.625
Olmo, I know we're ignorant,

04:55:00.660 --> 04:55:04.125
but how can we have a trial
without a lawyer?

04:55:04.160 --> 04:55:06.660
I bring you the accused
and you ask me for a lawyer?

04:55:06.695 --> 04:55:08.125
I mean, isn't that enough?

04:55:08.160 --> 04:55:11.160
But we are the ones
who caught him, not you.

04:55:11.195 --> 04:55:13.125
No, you didn't catch him, either.

04:55:13.160 --> 04:55:16.160
He surrendered to Leonito
right after he saw his gun.

04:55:16.195 --> 04:55:17.886
Yes, you're right.

04:55:23.618 --> 04:55:26.202
Lift it high! Higher!

04:56:22.077 --> 04:56:24.077
Let's dance! Come on!

04:56:24.112 --> 04:56:25.577
- Dance.
- Get away.

04:56:26.077 --> 04:56:27.577
Dance! Come on.

04:56:29.077 --> 04:56:30.077
Dance!

04:56:40.577 --> 04:56:44.077
When a mute begins to speak,
he has much to say,

04:56:44.112 --> 04:56:47.542
but the poor man is tongue-tied, as well.

04:56:47.577 --> 04:56:50.577
It's all right.
Speak with your heart, old man.

04:57:02.285 --> 04:57:03.785
Stop the music.

04:57:07.327 --> 04:57:10.285
I-- I lost them harvesting your wheat
for 60 years.

04:57:10.320 --> 04:57:13.202
Can you make good now?
Can they be returned?

04:57:26.452 --> 04:57:28.042
Why did all these teeth drop out?

04:57:28.077 --> 04:57:30.160
The <i>padrone's</i> are still there,
all shined up.

04:57:30.195 --> 04:57:32.243
He's able to munch with them
all day long.

04:57:32.278 --> 04:57:34.785
Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum!

04:57:45.535 --> 04:57:47.458
We made money for you
and you spent it.

04:57:47.493 --> 04:57:49.493
- You're washed and we're filthy.
- You rest while we work.

04:57:49.993 --> 04:57:52.077
You had plenty in your stomach
in the famine.

04:57:57.785 --> 04:58:00.667
You're just a leech
but your old grandfather was even worse.

04:58:00.702 --> 04:58:04.535
It's true. After a hailstorm,
he wanted to fire all the day laborers.

04:58:04.570 --> 04:58:06.833
Oh, he wasn't the one.
It was his papa, Giovanni.

04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:10.827
He's the son. It makes no difference.
A <i>padrone</i> remains a <i>padrone.</i>

04:58:17.910 --> 04:58:22.243
All land needs laborers,
otherwise it would go to ruin.

04:58:22.278 --> 04:58:26.577
But the <i>padrone?</i>
Does anyone need the <i>padrone,</i> huh?

04:58:34.827 --> 04:58:37.327
I have one thing to say.
I've never hurt anyone.

04:58:38.327 --> 04:58:40.035
I've never hurt anyone.

04:58:40.535 --> 04:58:43.500
All the <i>padrone</i>
claim the very same thing.

04:58:43.535 --> 04:58:46.035
And they're such big hypocrites,
they think it's true.

04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:49.292
I have never hurt anyone.

04:58:49.327 --> 04:58:51.327
To be able to say that,
you've taken criminals out of prison

04:58:51.362 --> 04:58:54.327
and put communists in their place?

04:58:54.362 --> 04:58:55.827
Listen to me, comrades.

04:58:58.327 --> 04:59:01.077
Fascists don't spring up someday

04:59:01.112 --> 04:59:03.792
like mushrooms, all in one night.

04:59:03.827 --> 04:59:07.827
No. Fascists are the <i>padrone's</i> offspring.

04:59:07.862 --> 04:59:10.792
Inventions of the <i>padrone.</i>

04:59:10.827 --> 04:59:13.327
And with these fascists,
they began earning more and more.

04:59:13.362 --> 04:59:16.327
So much that they had
to put their fortunes to use,

04:59:16.362 --> 04:59:18.792
and that's how war was invented.

04:59:18.827 --> 04:59:22.827
For we were sent
to Africa, Russia, Greece,

04:59:22.862 --> 04:59:25.292
Albania, and Spain.

04:59:25.327 --> 04:59:27.327
But did they pay?
No, we're the ones that paid!

04:59:27.362 --> 04:59:29.827
The proletariat, the peasant, the workers!

04:59:29.862 --> 04:59:31.136
You paid for it!

04:59:34.910 --> 04:59:38.208
He pays now!
He pays now!

04:59:38.243 --> 04:59:41.243
Do you hear that, Alfredo Berlinghieri?

04:59:41.278 --> 04:59:43.243
You hear the voice of the people?

04:59:44.243 --> 04:59:46.243
We, the ignorant hicks...

04:59:47.243 --> 04:59:49.208
who die of starvation,

04:59:49.243 --> 04:59:51.243
will set an example here
in this miserable asshole of the world.

04:59:51.278 --> 04:59:52.743
We sentence you to death.

04:59:53.077 --> 04:59:55.743
We condemn you and the past condemns you.

04:59:57.077 --> 04:59:58.577
That's it, comrades.

04:59:59.577 --> 05:00:01.077
No more <i>padrone.</i>

05:00:03.077 --> 05:00:04.785
The <i>padrone</i> is a dead man.

05:00:07.285 --> 05:00:09.785
I'm very tired.
May I sit down?

05:00:19.202 --> 05:00:20.702
I'm very tired.

05:00:23.702 --> 05:00:26.472
If I understand it right,
we're looking at a dead person.

05:00:26.507 --> 05:00:29.243
Yes, he thinks he's alive,
and for us the man's dead.

05:00:29.278 --> 05:00:31.535
He doesn't exist anymore.

05:00:38.452 --> 05:00:41.452
The man's alive.
His body's on fire.

05:00:41.487 --> 05:00:42.910
Usually, the dead grow cold.

05:00:43.410 --> 05:00:45.993
Olmo, you learned
how to speak better than a peasant.

05:00:46.028 --> 05:00:48.458
Here.

05:00:48.493 --> 05:00:50.910
But you should explain
with simple talk.

05:00:50.945 --> 05:00:54.327
That educated talk can play tricks.

05:00:54.577 --> 05:00:58.910
The <i>padrone</i> is dead
but Alfredo Berlinghieri is alive.

05:00:58.945 --> 05:01:00.368
And we mustn't kill him.

05:01:00.403 --> 05:01:02.125
But why not?

05:01:02.160 --> 05:01:05.702
Because he's the living proof
that the <i>padrone's</i> dead.

05:01:20.993 --> 05:01:24.118
And now let's vote.
Who agrees, raise your hands.

05:03:20.785 --> 05:03:23.285
Comrade, the partisans!

05:03:23.785 --> 05:03:25.785
The partisans are coming.

05:03:27.285 --> 05:03:28.785
Partisans.

05:03:29.785 --> 05:03:31.681
Comrades, the partisans.

05:03:31.716 --> 05:03:33.577
The partisans are here.

05:03:59.868 --> 05:04:02.333
Hey, comrades.

05:04:02.368 --> 05:04:04.118
Silence. Silence, please.

05:04:04.153 --> 05:04:05.868
Come over here, everybody!

05:04:06.368 --> 05:04:09.368
I have an important communication to make.

05:04:09.403 --> 05:04:11.368
Everybody, come over here!

05:04:14.368 --> 05:04:15.583
Hey, let me look at it!

05:04:15.618 --> 05:04:17.583
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

05:04:17.618 --> 05:04:19.083
- An American gun!
- Give it to me. Let's see.

05:04:19.118 --> 05:04:21.952
We have come here in the name of
the Committee of National Liberation.

05:04:21.987 --> 05:04:24.952
We represent the Christian democrats,

05:04:25.452 --> 05:04:27.452
we represent the liberals,

05:04:27.487 --> 05:04:29.417
we represent the socialists,

05:04:29.452 --> 05:04:32.410
we represent the communists
and the action party.

05:04:32.445 --> 05:04:34.906
This Committee for the Liberation of Italy...

05:04:34.941 --> 05:04:37.333
- Sit down.
- has assumed power temporarily,

05:04:37.368 --> 05:04:41.243
for the purpose of maintaining
law and order in the country.

05:04:41.278 --> 05:04:43.208
And so, dear friends,
I ask you to adhere

05:04:43.243 --> 05:04:45.743
to the decision of the
National Committee for Liberation

05:04:45.778 --> 05:04:47.719
and turn your arms over to us.

05:04:47.754 --> 05:04:49.660
- No!
- Those are the orders!

05:04:52.910 --> 05:04:54.952
Comrades, victory is like
when you're drunk.

05:04:54.987 --> 05:04:56.375
- No!
- Yes!

05:04:56.410 --> 05:04:58.472
When you drink,
you say what you feel in your heart.

05:04:58.507 --> 05:05:00.535
- It's a trap, Olmo.
- Everything seems to be new for you.

05:05:00.660 --> 05:05:02.542
No, it's the old story.
I'm not going to fall for it.

05:05:02.577 --> 05:05:06.160
The moment of truth arrives and it demands
that everyone must get sober,

05:05:06.195 --> 05:05:09.035
and put your head and heart
under the faucet and stop drinking.

05:05:09.070 --> 05:05:10.910
- They're double-crossing us.
- Yes.

05:05:10.945 --> 05:05:12.577
But, please, all right--

05:05:13.077 --> 05:05:15.118
Those guns belong to us!
It's all bullshit!

05:05:15.493 --> 05:05:18.451
Why give them the guns?
They belong to us all.

05:05:18.486 --> 05:05:21.198
Tomorrow they'll call it utopia.
That's fine!

05:05:21.233 --> 05:05:23.910
But remember, if there's evidence
to persuade us

05:05:23.945 --> 05:05:24.910
that the <i>padrone's</i> still there,

05:05:24.945 --> 05:05:26.410
we must say no anyway.

05:05:26.910 --> 05:05:28.875
Because we know, we saw,
all of us.

05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:31.660
We know the truth.
The <i>padrone's</i> dead!

05:06:13.993 --> 05:06:15.493
Hey, boy, didn't you hear the orders?

05:06:15.993 --> 05:06:18.743
No! Give it back to me!
It's my gun!

05:06:18.778 --> 05:06:21.458
Give it back!
It's mine! It's mine!

05:06:21.493 --> 05:06:24.493
Give it back! It's mine!
Give it back to me!

05:07:35.493 --> 05:07:37.493
The <i>padrone's</i> alive.

05:10:40.910 --> 05:10:41.910
Oh!
