00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:38.270
Stage 5.
Mr. Amiel is rehearsing right now.

00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:51.621
Very nice.

00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:56.265
Honey, could you put your hand
up by your throat?

00:01:56.466 --> 00:02:01.062
Telephone, Mr. Amiel.
Transatlantic, Paris. Jonathan Shields.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.602
- Who?
- Jonathan Shields.

00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:07.105
- Number one!
- Bring the boom back to one.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:11.275
I'm sorry, Mr. Amiel just left.

00:02:13.282 --> 00:02:20.211
Hello? Yes.
Who? One moment, please.

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:25.053
Miss Georgia!
It's Paris, France. It's him!

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:28.126
I can't hear you.

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:31.892
It's Mr. Jonathan!
Jonathan Shields.

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:34.934
I still can't hear you.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.403
Miss Lorrison is out.

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:45.036
No, I don't know.
No. I don't know where.

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:47.944
No, I don't know who...

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:52.884
...nor where, nor what.
Out is out!

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:02.061
Hello.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.130
What?

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:08.326
Talk a little louder, please.
It's a bad connection.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:11.564
Yes, this is James Lee Bartlow.

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:14.572
Paris?

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:17.705
Mr. Shields?

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:22.507
Is Mr. Shields paying for this call?

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.181
Put him on.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.587
Hello, Jonathan?
Drop dead.

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:51.439
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Harry, how are you?

00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:53.768
- Georgia.
- Harry.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.879
Since I became 60, more beautiful
women have kissed me than ever before.

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:04.177
You youngsters wouldn't know
anything about that.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.618
Nice to see you.
That waistline is back down.

00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:11.691
- Still keeping long hours.
- A little bit of midnight oil.

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:16.490
You can tell a successful author
by a cashmere jacket.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.432
I'm trying to get a wardrobe like
yours. You're known for your style.

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:25.095
Georgia, darling. Come over
and sit down.

00:05:25.308 --> 00:05:27.674
Freddie, take this chair.

00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:35.007
- Congratulations on the Pulitzer Prize.
- Thanks, Harry.

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:39.086
- Your picture was great as usual, Fred.
- Thank you, Harry.

00:05:39.288 --> 00:05:42.883
And you, my pretty one,
you really made me cry.

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:45.424
Have I flattered you enough?

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:48.791
Here's why I asked you here
in the middle of the night.

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:52.399
Why Jonathan called you today.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:58.302
Jimmy told me you told him to drop dead.
Is that Pulitzer language?

00:05:58.507 --> 00:06:01.738
James Lee never wrote a better line!

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:08.474
Well, here it is. After two years
Jonathan's ready to produce a picture.

00:06:08.684 --> 00:06:13.485
He wants you to write it,
you to direct and you to star.

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:19.720
On the name Jonathan Shields,
it's impossible to raise five cents.

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:24.730
But on Fred Amiel, Georgia Lorrison,
James Lee Bartlow...

00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:28.768
...I can raise $2,000,000
by tomorrow noon.

00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:33.832
I'm not going to beg you after
two years of begging for Jonathan.

00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:37.501
That's enough. I know you'll never
work with him again.

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:39.704
But he doesn't get that.

00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:43.784
Please. A favor to me, not to him.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:48.685
Will you give me your answer
while I get him on the phone?

00:06:50.092 --> 00:06:51.787
Good.

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:55.259
Get me the transatlantic operator.

00:06:55.464 --> 00:06:58.797
We're ready to talk
with Jonathan Shields in Paris.

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:01.970
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Thank you.

00:07:02.838 --> 00:07:05.363
You won't work with him.
I don't blame you.

00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:11.304
Why should you? You've done enough
for him already... and vice versa.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:17.544
Fred, you knew him first. You must
have known him for 15 or 16...

00:07:17.753 --> 00:07:19.550
18 years.

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:24.224
<i>18 years ago at that funeral.</i>

00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:29.330
<i>That guy standing next to me.</i>
<i>How should I know who he was?</i>

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:33.229
We are met, my friends,
on a solemn occasion.

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:36.371
This man, Hugo Shields...

00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:40.770
...whose memory
we all cherish in our hearts...

00:07:40.976 --> 00:07:44.969
...whose loss we mourn so deeply.

00:07:46.015 --> 00:07:49.109
Hugo Shields, one of the pioneers...

00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:53.220
...who built our great
motion-picture industry.

00:07:53.422 --> 00:07:55.720
A madman who almost wrecked it.

00:07:55.925 --> 00:08:00.862
A man of vision. An artist,
who created in the new medium...

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:03.793
A butcher who sold all
but the pig's whistle.

00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:08.333
Hugo Shields brought
entertainment to millions.

00:08:08.537 --> 00:08:12.029
He will never be forgotten.

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:17.407
Stay in line and take it easy.
You'll get your dough.

00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:24.250
Thank you, Mr. Shields.

00:08:25.654 --> 00:08:27.485
You're Shields?

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.217
You were hired to perform.
$11 to act like a mourner.

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:35.261
You didn't do your job,
you don't get paid. Next.

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:37.193
Next!

00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:48.866
<i>That afternoon I drove into</i>
<i>the Hollywood Hills. I just had to.</i>

00:09:06.095 --> 00:09:10.794
- It's me, Big Mouth.
- Come for a fight or your 11 bucks?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.063
The things I said at the funeral
were childish and cheap. I'm sorry.

00:09:16.272 --> 00:09:19.173
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:25.136
You in the business?
What do you do?

00:09:25.347 --> 00:09:29.909
Bit of everything: Assistant director
on Poverty Row, four-day quickies...

00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:35.113
...sold a couple of story ideas. To eat
I work as an extra and do stunts.

00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:38.919
- What I aim to be is a director.
- What's stopping you?

00:09:39.128 --> 00:09:43.087
I can direct better than most
of the hacks I work for.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:49.238
When it comes to telling people
how good I am, I get tongue-tied.

00:09:49.438 --> 00:09:51.929
I'm not that tongue-tied with you.

00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:55.304
- You are looking for a job?
- Yeah.

00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:58.105
So am I.

00:09:58.314 --> 00:10:00.714
Come on in.

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:13.895
If my father had died last year,
I'd be a millionaire.

00:10:14.096 --> 00:10:18.055
Next year, he'd have put up
a new studio for me to inherit.

00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:20.258
This year, I don't have a dime.

00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:24.963
- Who paid the crowd at the funeral?
- That was the last of the cash.

00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:30.305
He lived in a crowd.
I couldn't let him be buried alone.

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:51.763
The best legal counsel advised me
to change my name.

00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:56.063
Because the town thought
your father was a heel?

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:03.037
He wasn't a heel.

00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:06.009
He was the heel.

00:11:06.215 --> 00:11:10.948
We couldn't stand living in the
same town, but I liked him a lot.

00:11:11.153 --> 00:11:14.213
He made great pictures. So will I.

00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:17.755
You haven't got much to begin with.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.761
No, he brought me up to start at the
top. How do you start at the bottom?

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:26.196
- Are you gonna change your name?
- Change it?

00:11:27.303 --> 00:11:31.672
I'm gonna ram the name of Shields
down their throats.

00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:36.202
Where are you living?

00:11:36.412 --> 00:11:40.212
Until they kick me out,
this is my bed and board.

00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:42.077
Come on.

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.817
By the way, my name is Fred Amiel.

00:11:52.027 --> 00:11:54.052
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:04.595
<i>18 years ago, living was cheap here,</i>
<i>but jobs were sky-high.</i>

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.275
<i>Particularly if your name was Shields.</i>

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:11.037
<i>Some days we'd hit with a quickie</i>
<i>or a Western on Poverty Row...</i>

00:12:11.246 --> 00:12:13.339
<i>... and eat well.</i>

00:12:20.155 --> 00:12:22.316
Okay, boys. Let's go.

00:12:27.863 --> 00:12:30.127
Grab that one.

00:12:31.166 --> 00:12:33.726
<i>And some nights we played.</i>

00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:38.100
<i>We crashed only the very best parties.</i>

00:12:38.307 --> 00:12:44.837
If the actor counts five between
each word, you think he's good.

00:12:45.047 --> 00:12:48.813
And directing? If you don't film it,
get it in the cutting room.

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:53.421
Man's in love, cut to a cactus.
She goes crazy, fade into a wheel.

00:12:53.622 --> 00:12:56.523
Montage, montage!
But where is your story?

00:12:56.725 --> 00:12:59.091
All right, so I won't argue with you.

00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:03.822
I'm taking off my agent hat
and putting on my friendship hat.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:07.969
This boy can be the biggest ever,
your next Victor Ribera.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:13.301
He's got everything: Heart, brains
and he's beautiful to look at.

00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:34.719
I don't care what she writes about me.
It's what she wrote about Arturo.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.797
He hit me and hurt me.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.164
I'm not always yelling about
a star's right to a private life.

00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:45.499
Fans are entitled to see us
in the flesh sometimes.

00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:48.506
Only last week I was in New York...

00:13:48.711 --> 00:13:54.581
I've got a full house,
and you can't have four of a kind. No.

00:13:54.783 --> 00:13:57.343
Not even in one of your B pictures!

00:13:57.553 --> 00:14:01.284
- Harry, I think you're bluffing.
- Put up or shut up.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.392
Money talks, and I've got money.
I raise you 500.

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:09.997
- Right back at you.
- Five, and five more.

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:13.862
- Call.
- Four fours.

00:14:14.636 --> 00:14:20.438
When did you begin to tell the truth?
Don't tell me "today." What time today?

00:14:39.595 --> 00:14:44.157
- Harry Pebbel's a great poker player.
- Yeah.

00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:49.394
But my father could always beat him,
and I could always beat my father.

00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:54.668
- To get in a game like that, I need...
- You're crazy!

00:14:54.877 --> 00:15:00.008
All I need is a few hundred dollars
for my first stack of chips.

00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:06.921
<i>What's a few hundred dollars when</i>
<i>four citizens pool their resources?</i>

00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:16.591
<i>Came the dawn...</i>

00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:27.332
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.

00:15:28.443 --> 00:15:31.935
- Jonathan!
- How much did you win?

00:15:34.283 --> 00:15:36.615
- Five hundred?
- A thousand?

00:15:36.819 --> 00:15:40.118
- More than that. Six thousand.
- Jonathan!

00:15:40.322 --> 00:15:42.449
I lost.

00:15:42.658 --> 00:15:46.924
To be exact, I lost $6,351.

00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:50.758
- Who won?
- Harry Pebbel.

00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:55.270
Harry, I admit it.
I lost the money and I owe you.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.735
- I wish I could pay.
- It's breaking your heart.

00:15:58.941 --> 00:16:01.933
- I could give you an IOU.
- What would I do with it?

00:16:02.144 --> 00:16:06.137
You don't run this studio,
but you're an executive producer.

00:16:06.348 --> 00:16:08.407
- B pictures...
- They make money.

00:16:08.617 --> 00:16:10.915
You have four producers, why not five?

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:14.714
At $300 a week I could pay you off,
slowly, but surely.

00:16:14.923 --> 00:16:17.949
$6,351.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.652
- All right, you got the job.
- I thought so.

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:26.557
So you're a genius boy.
You think you blackmailed me!

00:16:26.768 --> 00:16:28.736
Harry, that's a horrid word.

00:16:28.937 --> 00:16:33.033
Well, get this.
My unit turns out 18 pictures a year.

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:39.704
I cry for ideas. If you'd sweat out a
story the way you do $6,351...

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:44.249
...I'd have hired you anyway.
Why didn't you come to me? Too proud?

00:16:44.453 --> 00:16:46.478
I tried to. I couldn't get in.

00:16:46.688 --> 00:16:50.124
- You know who gave me my first job?
- My father.

00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:53.726
- You angle things the cute way.
- I'll pay you $100 a week.

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:58.662
I wouldn't take a dime. Just bring me
a picture I can shoot, Genius Boy.

00:16:58.867 --> 00:17:03.395
- One day you'll work for me.
- Get me Joe Clareton in publicity.

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:07.701
Meanwhile, I need an office
with a desk for my assistant.

00:17:11.713 --> 00:17:14.978
Shields. Amiel.

00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:21.488
- That's a big dream, Jonathan.
- If you dream, dream big.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:26.354
Meanwhile, you'll be drawing
a modest check each Thursday.

00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:29.325
It's time you two made it legal.

00:17:29.531 --> 00:17:33.160
- Tell him he's crazy, IKKay.
- You're crazy.

00:17:33.368 --> 00:17:36.428
- Tell him I'm not.
- He's not.

00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:39.835
I just happen to have a ring with me.

00:17:40.042 --> 00:17:44.411
Syd Murphy knows a friend
who knows a jeweler.

00:17:44.613 --> 00:17:48.777
- Shall we?
- Tell him yes, IKKay.

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:55.419
He said to tell me yes.

00:18:06.902 --> 00:18:10.201
She says yes very nicely.

00:18:12.574 --> 00:18:17.307
<i>The next few years, Shields produced</i>
<i>11 B pictures for Harry Pebbel.</i>

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.415
<i>I directed the third</i>
<i>and five more after that.</i>

00:18:21.616 --> 00:18:27.145
<i>We weren't really picturemakers,</i>
<i>we were second-hand dealers.</i>

00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.415
<i>But we learnt our trade.</i>

00:18:29.624 --> 00:18:33.151
<i>Then, one cloudy day, Harry Pebbel</i>
<i>assigned us a horror...</i>

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.853
<i>... called</i> The Doom of the Cat Men.

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:42.434
This the sort of thing you had in mind?
They need freshening up, though.

00:18:42.637 --> 00:18:44.867
- I can't get into this.
- Don't worry.

00:18:45.073 --> 00:18:49.169
If they don't turn around too much,
some muslin will hide it.

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:53.144
This needs fitting. Our department
will take care of that.

00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:57.715
This may be a problem
unless you get a thinner man.

00:18:57.919 --> 00:19:01.514
This material is imported.
We can't get it anymore.

00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:05.318
But don't let that be an obstacle.
Here, the perfect fit.

00:19:05.527 --> 00:19:09.224
This will give the full effect.
Lots of character and detail.

00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:12.457
Plenty of fright. Needs puffing, but it'll do.

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:16.330
You gotta visualize it in the lights,
use imagination.

00:19:16.538 --> 00:19:19.098
Shoulder pads will straighten it out.

00:19:19.307 --> 00:19:23.038
This will give you the effect.
It'll be good.

00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:42.653
- What if...?
- Suppose we...

00:19:51.706 --> 00:19:56.666
- Five men dressed like cats look like...
- Five men dressed like cats.

00:19:56.878 --> 00:20:00.871
When an audience pays to see this,
what do they pay for?

00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:06.612
- To get the pants scared off them?
- What scares us more than anything?

00:20:11.593 --> 00:20:13.652
- The dark!
- Of course, and why?

00:20:13.862 --> 00:20:18.765
The dark has a life of its own,
and all sorts of things come alive.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:23.063
- Suppose we never show the cat men.
- Exactly.

00:20:23.271 --> 00:20:24.932
No cat men.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:31.568
What do we put on the screen that'll
make the backs of their necks crawl?

00:20:32.914 --> 00:20:35.405
Two eyes shining in the dark.

00:20:35.617 --> 00:20:38.609
A dog: Frightened, growling,
showing its fangs.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.880
A bird: Its neck broken,
feathers torn from its throat.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.582
A little girl: Screaming,
claw marks down her cheeks.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.958
Cut!

00:20:55.137 --> 00:20:57.867
Okay, boys, new deal. Wrap it up!

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.765
This is my first star!

00:21:02.177 --> 00:21:06.841
<i>The night of the sneak preview,</i>
<i>Harry Pebbel still hadn't seen it.</i>

00:21:07.048 --> 00:21:10.449
<i>Jonathan and I</i>
<i>had made sure of that.</i>

00:21:15.657 --> 00:21:18.217
Go, go, go!

00:22:11.713 --> 00:22:14.511
- Hurry, hurry.
- Now, sir.

00:22:43.745 --> 00:22:47.545
"It stinks": 1. "Fair": 8.

00:22:47.749 --> 00:22:51.879
"Good": 24. "Very good": 47.
We've never had cards like this.

00:22:52.087 --> 00:22:56.717
- Give us more like this one.
- "Excellent": 34. "Outstanding": 17.

00:22:56.925 --> 00:23:00.520
I'll put these in the executive dining room.
That'll show 'em.

00:23:00.729 --> 00:23:03.926
- What Harry Pebbel can do...
- Be at my office at 10:00 a.m.

00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:07.932
I'll give you your next assignment.
You did all right.

00:23:08.136 --> 00:23:12.334
I did a great job at producing.
Tell that to the executives.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.499
And remember that "Shields"
is not spelled P-E-B-B-E-L.

00:23:16.711 --> 00:23:21.705
I don't wanna give you too much credit.
Just enough to keep you hungry.

00:23:30.592 --> 00:23:34.255
By the way, my name
is spelled A-M-I-E-L.

00:23:34.462 --> 00:23:37.090
I thought of taking a small bow myself.

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:40.860
A small bow never helped anybody.
Get this straight, Fred.

00:23:41.069 --> 00:23:43.503
We're building Shields Productions.

00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:45.969
What we'll ram it down their throats.

00:23:46.174 --> 00:23:48.165
- It's big enough for both of us.
- I know.

00:23:48.376 --> 00:23:52.745
A five-cent story, a ten-cent budget
and a two-cent leading man...

00:23:52.947 --> 00:23:56.713
...and we put it over.
We're getting to know our business.

00:23:56.918 --> 00:24:00.752
- Yes, Mother.
- Let's go back and get my car.

00:24:01.956 --> 00:24:05.483
When I work on a picture,
it's like romancing a girl.

00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:09.687
You see her, you want her,
you go after her. The big moment.

00:24:09.898 --> 00:24:13.732
Then, the letdown. Every time.
The after-picture blues.

00:24:13.935 --> 00:24:18.031
Don't worry. Someday you'll learn
to love 'em and leave 'em.

00:24:21.876 --> 00:24:25.972
- Why are you turning off here?
- This you got to see.

00:24:38.827 --> 00:24:44.060
Crow's Nest.
George Lorrison built this.

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:46.557
This is where he died.

00:24:46.768 --> 00:24:51.228
I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
Can we go home now?

00:24:58.113 --> 00:25:03.779
So this is how actors used to live.
Cheerful little place, isn't it?

00:25:03.985 --> 00:25:08.888
Now, if we can just find out
where he keeps the boiling oil...

00:25:11.493 --> 00:25:14.018
The rumpus room.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.504
Jonathan, will you please tell me
what we're doing here?

00:25:24.706 --> 00:25:26.674
You scouting a location?

00:25:26.875 --> 00:25:30.606
Sure, that's it.
For our next Harry Pebbel production.

00:25:30.812 --> 00:25:34.077
It could be
<i>The Bat Men Fly Again...</i>

00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:37.718
...or <i>Mama Vampire</i>
<i>and the Three Little Bloodsuckers.</i>

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:41.286
- We don't even have to show...
- Hold this.

00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:53.858
Lorrison's idea of my old man.

00:25:54.869 --> 00:25:58.965
Lorrison's last three pictures
were for my father.

00:25:59.874 --> 00:26:03.833
He gave me my first drink
when I was 13.

00:26:04.045 --> 00:26:08.345
My first cigar at 14.
And when I was 15...

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.041
...he taught me the facts of life.

00:26:17.926 --> 00:26:19.985
He was a great actor...

00:26:21.095 --> 00:26:26.055
...and a great man.
- He was a rat and a drunk.

00:26:33.908 --> 00:26:37.105
- Who are you?
- His daughter.

00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:42.113
- I didn't know he had one.
- Neither did he half the time.

00:26:42.317 --> 00:26:46.276
- What are you doing up there?
- Get out.

00:26:46.488 --> 00:26:49.582
"A rat and a drunk."
What talk about your father!

00:26:49.791 --> 00:26:54.251
He was my father.
Now, shut up and leave me alone?

00:26:54.462 --> 00:26:59.331
- Go on, blow.
- Somebody ought to tan your rear!

00:27:01.135 --> 00:27:03.763
Wanna try it?

00:27:06.441 --> 00:27:09.001
I changed my mind.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.610
Now, will you get out of here?

00:27:11.813 --> 00:27:13.974
Go on, get out!

00:27:40.141 --> 00:27:45.602
<i>The next morning, Jonathan</i>
<i>received our next assignment.</i>

00:27:45.813 --> 00:27:47.838
Did you see Harry?

00:27:50.151 --> 00:27:53.348
Well, what's our next picture?

00:27:55.623 --> 00:27:58.183
Get a good grip on yourself.

00:27:59.861 --> 00:28:02.056
You ready?

00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:05.562
Our next picture will be
<i>The Son of the Cat Men.</i>

00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:14.037
That settles it.

00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:18.845
The time has come.

00:28:20.114 --> 00:28:24.608
<i>The Faraway Mountain.</i>
It's a great book.

00:28:26.187 --> 00:28:28.246
Three studios tried to lick it and couldn't.

00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:30.481
Well, I can!

00:28:32.293 --> 00:28:35.319
Here's my outline, scene for scene.

00:28:35.897 --> 00:28:38.422
- You know what Harry will say.
- Yeah.

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:42.592
"Look, I've told you
a hundred times, Genius Boy...

00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:46.831
...I want pictures that end with
a kiss and ink on the books."

00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:51.102
Jonathan, this is my baby.
I found it and I licked it.

00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:55.772
I've been nursing it till I was sure
we could handle it. Now I'm sure.

00:28:55.984 --> 00:28:57.849
Remember what you said last night?

00:28:58.052 --> 00:29:00.987
Enough practice.
It's time we made one for real.

00:29:01.189 --> 00:29:06.058
It cries for a million dollar budget
and location in Veracruz...

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:11.459
...but you producing and me directing,
we can do it on a Harry Pebbel budget.

00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:16.899
- For a guy who's tongue-tied...
- I could always talk to you.

00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:20.302
You really wanna do this one, Fred.

00:29:20.508 --> 00:29:23.341
I wanna direct it so much
I can taste it.

00:29:24.278 --> 00:29:26.746
All right, let's do it.

00:29:26.948 --> 00:29:29.143
Let's do it!

00:29:33.287 --> 00:29:36.313
I've said 100 times
I don't wanna win awards.

00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:39.084
Give me pictures that end with a kiss
and ink on the books.

00:29:39.293 --> 00:29:41.454
I make this picture, or I quit.

00:29:44.699 --> 00:29:47.429
This is my baby.
I found it, and I licked it.

00:29:47.635 --> 00:29:49.865
I wanna produce it so much I can taste it!

00:29:50.071 --> 00:29:53.529
I'm handing it to you,
father of <i>The Son of the Cat Men.</i>

00:29:55.677 --> 00:29:58.942
Do I produce <i>The Faraway Mountain</i>
or don't I?

00:29:59.147 --> 00:30:01.638
All right, Genius Boy.

00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:05.307
You've got it coming to you.
Make it and hang yourself.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.948
Why don't you fire me
and get it over with?

00:30:10.124 --> 00:30:12.592
I know the talk around the studio.

00:30:12.794 --> 00:30:17.322
They say I need you, that you do
the work and I get the credit.

00:30:17.532 --> 00:30:20.933
You think I don't know anything.
Well, I know one thing:

00:30:21.135 --> 00:30:25.367
Every studio in town turned
this stinker down. Go ahead, make it.

00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:29.737
It'll lay such a bomb you'll never get
another job in this industry.

00:30:29.944 --> 00:30:34.904
Will I let you produce it?
You're on suspension if you don't!

00:30:36.384 --> 00:30:39.182
<i>I thought my</i> Faraway Mountain
<i>outline was perfect.</i>

00:30:39.387 --> 00:30:42.117
<i>After three weeks with Jonathan,</i>
<i>it was twice as good.</i>

00:30:42.323 --> 00:30:45.486
<i>We worked day and night.</i>
<i>Kay kept the coffee hot and handy.</i>

00:30:45.693 --> 00:30:48.958
<i>As Jonathan shaped our material,</i>
<i>I saw what Hollywood...</i>

00:30:49.163 --> 00:30:53.862
<i>... later came to call</i>
<i>the "Shields touch," Jonathan's magic.</i>

00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:57.628
<i>Our toughest problem</i>
<i>was a leading man.</i>

00:30:57.839 --> 00:31:01.036
<i>On a Harry Pebbel budget,</i>
<i>a top star was out of the question.</i>

00:31:01.242 --> 00:31:04.541
<i>So, I directed tests, a dozen tests.</i>

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.243
<i>Action.</i>

00:31:08.583 --> 00:31:10.642
<i>So you are Theresa.</i>

00:31:10.852 --> 00:31:14.515
<i>I find you as your brother told me,</i>
<i>alone in the great house...</i>

00:31:14.722 --> 00:31:17.623
<i>... silent, proud and beautiful.</i>

00:31:17.825 --> 00:31:20.851
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>Are you afraid of me?</i>

00:31:23.397 --> 00:31:25.865
Switch over to the next one.

00:31:28.603 --> 00:31:30.366
<i>Action.</i>

00:31:32.206 --> 00:31:36.336
<i>So you are Theresa. I find you</i>
<i>as your brother told me I would...</i>

00:31:36.544 --> 00:31:41.481
<i>... alone in the great house,</i>
<i>proud, silent and beautiful.</i>

00:31:42.383 --> 00:31:45.375
- Who's the girl?
- Douvane said she could test with him.

00:31:45.586 --> 00:31:48.453
What did she promise?
Who is she?

00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:51.591
George Lorrison's daughter.

00:31:51.793 --> 00:31:54.227
Why didn't you shoot her face?

00:31:54.428 --> 00:31:56.862
She was drunk.

00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:01.901
This is murder, Syd.
Let's have that list again.

00:32:04.906 --> 00:32:08.239
You're the director, pick your poison.

00:32:08.442 --> 00:32:10.501
Jonathan.

00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:13.839
- What about Victor Ribera?
- Gaucho?

00:32:14.048 --> 00:32:17.108
- Why not?
- Sure you'd like him. Who wouldn't?

00:32:17.318 --> 00:32:22.312
- Why can't we get Gaucho?
- The whole town's after Latin lovers.

00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:26.926
- You wouldn't stand a chance.
- How do we know till we've tried?

00:32:27.929 --> 00:32:31.421
Maybe you could talk him
into it, Jonathan.

00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:38.105
Syd, what would appeal
to a guy like that?

00:32:38.306 --> 00:32:42.470
Gaucho? Well, if I know Gaucho...

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:07.259
I'll drive.

00:33:52.313 --> 00:33:54.543
<i>Jonathan forgot one thing.</i>

00:33:54.749 --> 00:33:57.616
<i>He forgot he couldn't drink.</i>

00:34:09.196 --> 00:34:14.156
Nice boy. But does he always
take on so much altitude?

00:34:14.368 --> 00:34:17.235
He's been working
night and day for three weeks.

00:34:17.438 --> 00:34:20.601
Besides which, he hardly ever drinks.

00:34:20.808 --> 00:34:24.710
- He wants me to make a picture?
- Yeah.

00:34:24.912 --> 00:34:28.973
Why does he go to all this
lovely trouble? I'm a very simple man.

00:34:29.183 --> 00:34:33.916
I read. What I like, I act.
What I do not like...

00:34:34.121 --> 00:34:37.454
...I do not act. Very simple.

00:35:08.122 --> 00:35:10.955
<i>A conference was held</i>
<i>in Pebbel's office...</i>

00:35:11.158 --> 00:35:14.025
<i>... to discuss production plans</i>
<i>for</i> The Faraway Mountain.

00:35:14.228 --> 00:35:17.288
<i>The suspense was killing me.</i>

00:35:19.934 --> 00:35:23.301
- Yes, Mr. Pebbel?
- You can go to lunch now.

00:35:24.472 --> 00:35:28.806
- Why don't you take a look in there?
- I think I'll stay here and be nervous.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.535
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

00:35:38.919 --> 00:35:40.716
Jonathan...

00:35:41.822 --> 00:35:46.782
- Didn't he go for Gaucho?
- Go for him? He had a hemorrhage!

00:35:46.994 --> 00:35:50.259
First time a star said he'd be
in a Pebbel picture.

00:35:50.464 --> 00:35:54.696
Harry went to bat for us. He slugged
it out with the front office!

00:35:54.902 --> 00:35:58.702
<i>The Faraway Mountain</i> will be made
with a million-dollar budget.

00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:01.431
Location in Veracruz.
Von Ellstein to direct.

00:36:01.642 --> 00:36:06.204
Gaucho. Wendy for the girl.
Chapman my cameraman...

00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:09.247
- Von Ellstein to direct...
- You're taken care of.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.681
No separate panel, but your name on
the screen: Assistant to the producer.

00:36:12.887 --> 00:36:17.256
- Thanks.
- You know the story. It's your baby.

00:36:17.458 --> 00:36:22.122
I want you on the set. You have
any ideas, I'll tell Von Ellstein.

00:36:22.329 --> 00:36:26.163
Thanks, again.
Von Ellstein to direct...

00:36:26.367 --> 00:36:29.063
- You said he was the best.
- Sure he is.

00:36:31.138 --> 00:36:35.973
Fred, I'd rather hurt you now
than kill you off forever.

00:36:36.177 --> 00:36:38.543
You're not ready
to direct a million dollar picture.

00:36:38.746 --> 00:36:41.271
But you're ready to produce one.

00:36:42.583 --> 00:36:44.574
With Von Ellstein, I am.

00:36:44.785 --> 00:36:47.515
You're stealing my picture!
It was my idea!

00:36:47.721 --> 00:36:49.780
Without me it was only an idea.

00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:56.123
All right, Jonathan.
Let's put it this way.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.026
You gave me your word.

00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:03.599
So I did.

00:37:03.804 --> 00:37:07.706
I got the starting date.
In two weeks you leave for Veracruz.

00:37:07.908 --> 00:37:10.536
Mr. Von Ellstein,
you'll go one week earlier.

00:37:10.744 --> 00:37:13.406
Mr. Shields, I don't like producers...

00:37:13.614 --> 00:37:15.673
...but for a man with such a script...

00:37:15.883 --> 00:37:18.113
...it'll be a pleasure to break my rule.

00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:20.947
Today, I shall buy a producer lunch.

00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:23.487
- Am I included?
- By all means, no.

00:37:23.691 --> 00:37:28.822
Today I've seen a script prepared by
a producer who thinks like a director.

00:37:29.029 --> 00:37:32.624
- 13 years I've been making pictures...
- Goodbye, Jonathan.

00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:34.733
Fred...

00:37:35.803 --> 00:37:37.737
So long, Fred.

00:37:37.938 --> 00:37:43.137
This is the first time I've found a
script I can direct exactly as it is...

00:37:45.212 --> 00:37:48.045
I always said the boy was a genius.

00:37:57.057 --> 00:38:00.754
Are you looking at the Oscar he got
for <i>The Faraway Mountain</i>?

00:38:00.961 --> 00:38:05.455
I know what you have
against Jonathan, and no wonder.

00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:07.725
Look what he did to you, Fred.

00:38:07.935 --> 00:38:11.598
He brushed you off his coattail,
so you had to stand alone.

00:38:12.406 --> 00:38:16.934
And all you've got in the world is
a wife, six kids, two Academy Awards...

00:38:17.144 --> 00:38:19.612
...and every studio in town after you.

00:38:19.813 --> 00:38:24.580
Why, Jonathan ruined you!
Look what he did to me.

00:38:25.986 --> 00:38:29.979
I gave him his chance to do
<i>The Faraway Mountain.</i>

00:38:30.191 --> 00:38:34.127
Four months later, his contract's up,
and he walks out of the studio.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.128
And I go right with him.

00:38:41.068 --> 00:38:43.832
I know how you feel about him, Georgia.

00:38:44.872 --> 00:38:48.308
After all, you're a woman
and an actress.

00:38:48.509 --> 00:38:54.277
<i>The first time I saw Jonathan,</i>
<i>I was not a woman or an actress.</i>

00:38:54.481 --> 00:38:57.644
<i>The next time I saw him,</i>
<i>five years later...</i>

00:38:57.851 --> 00:39:01.981
<i>... I wasn't an actress.</i>
<i>I was a nothing.</i>

00:39:02.189 --> 00:39:07.718
We'll sign you up outside. 9:00 people,
we'll need you in the background.

00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:11.989
Following people, on your way out
please report to wardrobe.

00:39:12.199 --> 00:39:14.292
- Mr. Amiel?
- What is it, Georgia?

00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:17.061
I'd like to sign out early if I could.

00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:20.604
They're casting a bit at Shields.
If I could get there by 3...

00:39:20.808 --> 00:39:24.073
- Go ahead. Good luck.
- Thanks, Mr. Amiel.

00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:28.881
<i>Gus drove me over.</i>
<i>He waited while I changed.</i>

00:39:29.083 --> 00:39:33.281
<i>There were few agents in town</i>
<i>with fewer clients than Gus.</i>

00:39:33.487 --> 00:39:36.854
<i>He was the kind of agent</i>
<i>who handled only bit players...</i>

00:39:37.057 --> 00:39:40.322
<i>... and who never could get into</i>
<i>a major producer's office.</i>

00:39:47.868 --> 00:39:50.302
<i>Gus is still my agent.</i>

00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:56.239
Girls, will you come in, please?
Line up right across here.

00:39:56.443 --> 00:40:00.971
You stand here, you over here.
Honey, will you come down here?

00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:03.012
Thank you.

00:40:05.786 --> 00:40:07.754
They're for the drugstore bit.

00:40:07.955 --> 00:40:11.618
- How about the newborn baby?
- Four here at 3:45.

00:40:13.694 --> 00:40:16.891
Girls. Mr. Shields,
Mr. Pebbel, Mr. McDill.

00:40:17.097 --> 00:40:19.691
How do you do?

00:40:29.943 --> 00:40:32.935
You're the director.
Is the girl on the end all right?

00:40:36.317 --> 00:40:38.251
Yeah, sure.

00:40:38.952 --> 00:40:42.979
- You're it.
- Thank you. Girls, come with me.

00:40:51.165 --> 00:40:53.725
<i>My call came two days later.</i>

00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:56.494
<i>By then, I'd memorized my one line.</i>

00:40:56.704 --> 00:40:58.729
I'll wait.

00:41:01.842 --> 00:41:04.936
Read any good books lately?

00:41:10.818 --> 00:41:13.184
- Cut.
- How was it?

00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:19.015
- Was that all right with you?
- Take it again?

00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:23.219
- Once again, boys! Here we go!
- How's the makeup?

00:41:29.002 --> 00:41:31.163
Try it again.

00:41:36.043 --> 00:41:38.807
All right, roll.

00:41:39.813 --> 00:41:41.974
- Speed.
- Action.

00:41:49.656 --> 00:41:52.056
I'll wait.

00:41:56.397 --> 00:41:59.628
Read any good books lately?

00:42:10.944 --> 00:42:13.879
- Cut!
- How was it?

00:42:14.848 --> 00:42:17.373
Print that. Let's have a test.

00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:20.413
- Move in for a close-up.
- New deal, boys.

00:42:37.738 --> 00:42:40.536
Your door was unlocked.

00:43:02.729 --> 00:43:06.062
For a one-day bit,
you sure expect a lot of company.

00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:11.069
For that kind of company,
I don't have to trot here at 4:00 a.m.

00:43:11.271 --> 00:43:15.935
- All I have to do is pick up a phone.
- Well, pick one up!

00:43:19.146 --> 00:43:22.547
You were under contract to Al Cope.

00:43:24.017 --> 00:43:26.952
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

00:43:27.921 --> 00:43:33.757
- You were under contract, right?
- Three years ago, for six months.

00:43:33.961 --> 00:43:37.192
Until they found
they had another cluck.

00:43:37.397 --> 00:43:40.093
Did you ever play
a real part in a picture?

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.464
Last year I played lead
in a little epic called <i>Jungle Tigress.</i>

00:43:44.671 --> 00:43:50.132
I ran it. You played straight man
to a chimpanzee. I've tried to find...

00:43:55.782 --> 00:43:58.876
I've been trying to find
one decent foot of film on you.

00:43:59.086 --> 00:44:01.418
- Is there any?
- Yes.

00:44:03.223 --> 00:44:05.589
That one line I did yesterday.

00:44:05.792 --> 00:44:10.024
That was good.
But it's not enough to go by.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.525
I want you to make a test for me.

00:44:28.215 --> 00:44:31.013
All right, Mr. Shields.

00:44:31.218 --> 00:44:34.381
Isn't this scene supposed
to go something like this?

00:44:34.588 --> 00:44:40.151
I'll make a test for you, and you'll
be good to me, and I'll be good to you.

00:44:42.462 --> 00:44:46.398
Who's kidding who?
It's 4 in the morning.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.367
The test, I don't want it.
I wouldn't be any good anyway.

00:44:51.572 --> 00:44:54.268
Just a waste of good film.

00:44:57.477 --> 00:45:03.177
But you're a nice-Iooking guy,
and you did go to a lot of trouble.

00:45:04.585 --> 00:45:08.043
And it's getting late,
so shall I turn out the light?

00:45:15.195 --> 00:45:18.096
You're very generous.

00:45:19.232 --> 00:45:21.325
Too generous.

00:45:22.336 --> 00:45:25.237
You're a Lorrison, all right.

00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:45.315
<i>The Queen, my lord, is dead.</i>

00:45:45.525 --> 00:45:51.157
<i>She should have died hereafter. There</i>
<i>would have been a time for such a word.</i>

00:45:52.232 --> 00:45:55.531
<i>Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...</i>

00:45:55.736 --> 00:45:59.263
<i>... creeps in this petty pace</i>
<i>from day to day...</i>

00:45:59.473 --> 00:46:03.432
<i>... to the last syllable of recorded time.</i>

00:46:04.311 --> 00:46:10.147
<i>And all our yesterdays have lighted</i>
<i>fools the way to dusty death.</i>

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.286
<i>Out, out, brief candle.</i>

00:46:15.088 --> 00:46:17.420
<i>Life's but a walking shadow...</i>

00:46:17.624 --> 00:46:21.321
<i>... a poor player that struts and frets</i>
<i>his hour upon the stage...</i>

00:46:21.528 --> 00:46:24.361
Turn that off and get out!
I wanna get some sleep.

00:46:24.564 --> 00:46:27.761
<i>It is a tale told by an idiot.</i>

00:46:28.502 --> 00:46:33.565
<i>Full of sound and fury,</i>
<i>signifying nothing.</i>

00:46:33.774 --> 00:46:36.140
Turn it off! I don't wanna hear it!
I hate him!

00:46:36.343 --> 00:46:39.278
Make up your mind. You hate him,
and you build this shrine.

00:46:39.479 --> 00:46:43.040
He died 10 years ago, and you've
been holding a wake since.

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:45.241
You can't be a star in a cemetery.

00:46:45.452 --> 00:46:50.754
Stop pitching! I'm one girl
who doesn't wanna be a star.

00:46:51.358 --> 00:46:54.759
Because he was a drunk, you are!
He loved girls, so you're a tramp!

00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:58.488
You forget one thing.
He did it with style.

00:47:01.168 --> 00:47:03.102
And you...

00:47:06.139 --> 00:47:09.074
- Put that down.
- Suicide, how many times?

00:47:09.276 --> 00:47:11.244
Twice. Put that pipe down!

00:47:13.213 --> 00:47:16.512
Too sacred to touch?

00:47:19.953 --> 00:47:23.116
Don't waste any sleep over me,
Mr. Shields.

00:47:23.323 --> 00:47:27.191
The last time I tried to commit suicide
was six months ago.

00:47:27.394 --> 00:47:30.192
- There won't be any next time.
- Won't there?

00:47:31.198 --> 00:47:33.393
No.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:39.129
People who knew my father
give me extra work now and then.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.233
I drink what I want and see who I want.

00:47:44.444 --> 00:47:46.571
Who knows?

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.216
Someday I may even get married...

00:47:50.417 --> 00:47:53.750
...to a nice upright assistant assistant.

00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:57.185
And make him miserable
for the rest of his life...

00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:01.190
...because you're a Lorrison:
Haunted, living by make-believe.

00:48:01.394 --> 00:48:05.660
You're acting now, playing the doomed
daughter of the great man.

00:48:05.866 --> 00:48:08.562
The acting isn't good enough.

00:48:08.769 --> 00:48:11.602
The cheap performance
of a bit player, not a star.

00:48:11.805 --> 00:48:14.797
That's all, until you pull
yourself from this tomb!

00:48:15.008 --> 00:48:18.466
Until you can see people as they are,
yourself as you are!

00:48:18.678 --> 00:48:22.478
Until you can do this
to your father's picture...

00:48:22.682 --> 00:48:24.650
...and laugh as he would have!

00:48:24.851 --> 00:48:28.514
That's not a god talking, Georgia,
that's only a man!

00:48:32.325 --> 00:48:34.088
You!

00:48:37.864 --> 00:48:41.027
Miss Lorrison! Miss Lorrison!

00:48:42.202 --> 00:48:45.000
You better tell her it's all right.

00:48:47.741 --> 00:48:50.539
It's all right, Mrs. Curry.

00:49:27.681 --> 00:49:29.842
Good night, Georgia.

00:49:31.651 --> 00:49:33.585
Good night.

00:49:41.895 --> 00:49:45.331
<i>It takes two hours</i>
<i>to get ready for a screen test.</i>

00:49:45.532 --> 00:49:48.865
<i>Two very-early-in-the-morning hours.</i>

00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:51.970
Hello, honey. Here you are.

00:49:52.172 --> 00:49:55.198
- Let's run the scene again.
- Thanks, Gus.

00:50:00.013 --> 00:50:03.278
"I think you understand."

00:50:03.483 --> 00:50:06.884
You mean you're through with me.
This is the end.

00:50:07.087 --> 00:50:12.650
- "To put it that bluntly..."
- It means that little to you?

00:50:12.859 --> 00:50:17.455
"Look, my dear.
We are two civilized people.

00:50:17.664 --> 00:50:19.996
Let us act like civilized people."

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.500
They told me about you.
I didn't believe them. You hear...

00:50:24.704 --> 00:50:27.468
- "But you're everything..."
- Oh, yeah.

00:50:27.674 --> 00:50:30.734
But you're everything they said.
You hear evil.

00:50:30.944 --> 00:50:36.075
You see evil. You speak evil.
You are evil.

00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:40.652
- Fine. Let's run it again.
- Okay.

00:50:42.389 --> 00:50:44.516
<i>... to put it bluntly.</i>

00:50:44.724 --> 00:50:47.955
<i>It means that little to you?</i>

00:50:48.161 --> 00:50:51.358
<i>Look, my dear.</i>
<i>We're two civilized people.</i>

00:50:51.564 --> 00:50:54.089
<i>Let us act like civilized people.</i>

00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:58.203
<i>They told me about you.</i>
<i>I didn't believe them.</i>

00:50:58.405 --> 00:51:00.396
<i>But you're everything they said.</i>

00:51:00.607 --> 00:51:05.408
<i>You hear evil. You see evil.</i>
<i>You speak evil.</i>

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.342
<i>You are evil!</i>

00:51:17.624 --> 00:51:19.785
What do you think?

00:51:21.561 --> 00:51:26.157
Dear Jonathan, since you've paid me
$100,000 to direct this picture...

00:51:26.366 --> 00:51:28.061
...a lot of pound sterling...

00:51:28.268 --> 00:51:31.032
...presumably
you want my kind of picture.

00:51:31.237 --> 00:51:35.071
With this girl, I tell you,
it won't be my kind of picture.

00:51:35.275 --> 00:51:37.641
- She's impossible.
- Quite.

00:51:37.844 --> 00:51:41.177
She's wooden, gauche, artificial.

00:51:41.381 --> 00:51:44.873
- Completely out of the question.
- Quite.

00:51:45.852 --> 00:51:47.877
Syd?

00:51:48.088 --> 00:51:51.387
Jonathan, since you hire me
partly to yes you...

00:51:51.591 --> 00:51:54.685
- You're fired.
- She stinks.

00:51:54.894 --> 00:52:00.059
- You're hired. Harry?
- I know we can get her for nothing.

00:52:00.266 --> 00:52:03.030
<i>For nothing you get nothing.</i>

00:52:03.236 --> 00:52:05.500
She's nothing.

00:52:06.306 --> 00:52:11.300
<i>There were few agents in town</i>
<i>with fewer clients than Gus...</i>

00:52:11.511 --> 00:52:15.538
<i>... but the few he had he knew well.</i>

00:52:36.236 --> 00:52:38.500
I told you not to waste your film.

00:52:38.705 --> 00:52:42.766
Gus, check with Harry Pebbel.
He's drawing up the contracts.

00:52:43.877 --> 00:52:47.074
- She's in it?
- Of course.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.408
You mean you're gonna give her a part?

00:52:50.617 --> 00:52:52.642
The part.

00:52:55.055 --> 00:52:57.285
Georgia!

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.624
Mr. Shields,
you're a very stubborn man.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:07.425
Very, when I'm right.
I know I'm right about you.

00:53:07.634 --> 00:53:11.730
I gave you no help. The test was
atrocious, but it proved one thing.

00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:16.375
When you're on the screen,
the audience is looking at you.

00:53:17.944 --> 00:53:20.538
That's star quality...

00:53:20.747 --> 00:53:22.681
...Lorrison quality.

00:53:23.683 --> 00:53:28.120
Careful, Mr. Shields. You're looking
at me, but you see my father.

00:53:28.321 --> 00:53:30.448
He gave me his name, but that's all.

00:53:30.657 --> 00:53:33.683
Don't make a mistake.

00:53:35.728 --> 00:53:37.662
Georgia...

00:53:37.864 --> 00:53:42.858
...no more doomed daughter, no more
whimpering, no more drinking...

00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:46.163
- And no more men?
- By and by.

00:53:46.372 --> 00:53:49.136
Gus, pull yourself together!

00:53:49.342 --> 00:53:53.938
I can't help it, Mr. Shields.
I'm a very emotional man.

00:53:58.852 --> 00:54:04.552
<i>The picture was to start in six weeks.</i>
<i>And six weeks seemed like forever.</i>

00:54:04.757 --> 00:54:09.558
<i>Then, suddenly, with fittings,</i>
<i>hairdressing and makeup tests...</i>

00:54:09.762 --> 00:54:12.230
<i>... five of them were gone.</i>

00:54:13.766 --> 00:54:18.760
I don't know what to do. The waist
has to be tight. The train, long...

00:54:18.972 --> 00:54:22.237
Evelyn, will you tell me
what's worrying you?

00:54:22.442 --> 00:54:25.377
Would you walk over there, please?

00:54:30.884 --> 00:54:32.749
Now, turn.

00:54:35.155 --> 00:54:39.387
Mr. Shields, I'm afraid Miss Lorrison
can't carry a dress like this.

00:54:39.592 --> 00:54:42.425
It takes an enormous amount of poise.

00:54:42.629 --> 00:54:48.590
You have to walk like a grand duchess
or hold yourself like Lilly Langtree.

00:54:48.801 --> 00:54:52.134
Miss Lorrison will hold herself
like Miss Lorrison.

00:54:52.338 --> 00:54:55.671
Miss Lorrison happens to be
an actress.

00:54:56.643 --> 00:54:59.271
Make a wider turn, Georgia.

00:55:01.414 --> 00:55:03.848
That's it.
Now, come over here.

00:55:05.685 --> 00:55:08.483
You're all right.
Come here.

00:55:09.689 --> 00:55:12.351
Sit down. Can you sit down?

00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:14.254
- No.
- Perfect.

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.487
Everybody out now, please.
I wanna talk to my star.

00:55:23.036 --> 00:55:26.767
- One week to go. Nervous?
- A little.

00:55:26.973 --> 00:55:29.840
- Tired?
- Very.

00:55:30.043 --> 00:55:32.603
You work very hard,
you're a good girl.

00:55:32.812 --> 00:55:34.905
How good?

00:55:35.114 --> 00:55:39.881
I'm sending you away.
Palm Springs for the rest of the week.

00:55:40.086 --> 00:55:42.987
- Must I?
- Absolutely.

00:55:43.189 --> 00:55:46.625
Till you're on set next week,
I want you to sleep...

00:55:46.826 --> 00:55:49.989
...relax, and not think about a thing.

00:55:50.196 --> 00:55:52.892
Not even you?

00:55:54.033 --> 00:55:57.935
- You said no drinking.
- One drink.

00:56:08.781 --> 00:56:11.545
To Georgia, my star.

00:56:13.987 --> 00:56:17.184
- You said no men.
- So I did.

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.893
- We'd agreed.
- You agreed all by yourself.

00:56:24.097 --> 00:56:28.966
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- Well, they sure come flapping out.

00:56:29.168 --> 00:56:35.937
My pavilion for the garden party,
it was to be three feet off the ground.

00:56:36.142 --> 00:56:40.476
That three feet will cost,
with charges and extra shooting time...

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.649
...$25,000, more or less,
and with you, more.

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:46.876
I can't shoot without it.
I won't shoot without it.

00:56:47.086 --> 00:56:50.578
I'm building an entire sequence
to that one moment.

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:53.987
- So move the camera up!
- I will not cheat the shot!

00:56:54.193 --> 00:56:57.993
- That's not the way I function.
- I'm not asking you to change...

00:56:58.197 --> 00:57:00.188
Jonathan!

00:57:03.102 --> 00:57:06.936
I have something to show you.
This is wonderful.

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.940
You can't say that.
I have to look after the budget.

00:57:11.144 --> 00:57:14.011
Look. My new car.

00:57:14.213 --> 00:57:18.877
I don't care where you put the camera.
Put your camera there.

00:57:19.085 --> 00:57:23.317
- A boom costs 150 dollars a day.
- We talked about that 3 weeks ago.

00:57:23.523 --> 00:57:27.220
- Like to drive it around the block?
- I'm busy.

00:57:27.427 --> 00:57:31.193
- As smooth a drive you'll never have.
- Gaucho, I'm busy.

00:57:31.397 --> 00:57:34.958
- How long would a quick ride take?
- Gaucho, I'm busy.

00:57:35.168 --> 00:57:39.867
You're always busy!
Why don't you live a little? <i>Adiôs.</i>

00:57:41.974 --> 00:57:46.377
- £25,000, I wanna tell you this...
- No, it's £7-8000.

00:57:46.579 --> 00:57:49.207
£7-8000. I'm the one who's got to...

00:57:49.415 --> 00:57:55.081
- I can't be shooting up their noses!
- Nobody's asking you to shoot up...

00:57:56.189 --> 00:58:00.353
Gentlemen, there seems to be
an honest difference of opinion.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.393
- We'll have to make a compromise.
- You bet.

00:58:03.596 --> 00:58:06.156
The compromise, gentlemen, is this.

00:58:06.366 --> 00:58:11.429
Harry, shut your penny-pinching
mouth and build him his platform!

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:42.558
<i>The night before we started shooting,</i>
<i>I came back from Palm Springs.</i>

00:58:42.769 --> 00:58:46.227
<i>I tried to sleep. I couldn't.</i>

00:58:46.439 --> 00:58:49.875
<i>I don't know what drew me</i>
<i>to the empty stage.</i>

00:58:50.076 --> 00:58:52.806
<i>I guess I was scared.</i>

00:59:28.047 --> 00:59:33.542
<i>"To my new star, who will make me</i>
<i>very proud of her. Jonathan. "</i>

00:59:44.564 --> 00:59:46.964
<i>It was cold on the set.</i>

00:59:47.166 --> 00:59:50.067
<i>And suddenly, my throat was dry.</i>

00:59:50.269 --> 00:59:54.729
<i>So dry I knew I had to have a drink.</i>

01:00:13.493 --> 01:00:16.087
The papers know,
but I asked them to lay off.

01:00:16.295 --> 01:00:18.855
She'll burn up every column
in the country.

01:00:19.065 --> 01:00:23.900
I wanted to do a picture with her, make
a star of someone this town discarded.

01:00:24.103 --> 01:00:29.234
Cross her off. Let me contact
the agents and see who's available.

01:00:31.811 --> 01:00:34.143
All right. Cast it and get it over with.

01:00:34.347 --> 01:00:37.908
I'll tell Whitfield to shoot around the part.

01:00:42.154 --> 01:00:44.213
- Sorry I'm late.
- Get out a release.

01:00:44.423 --> 01:00:48.951
We're signing Anne Gavery
for the part tomorrow morning.

01:00:53.199 --> 01:00:56.726
- The morgue gives me the jitters.
- Forget her.

01:00:56.936 --> 01:00:59.632
I've covered everything:
Waterfront, jails, hospitals...

01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:02.501
...scraped the Main Street booze parlors.

01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:06.109
- I told you to forget her.
- I have professional pride.

01:01:06.312 --> 01:01:12.649
I thought I knew every rathole in town.
She's found a new one, or she's left.

01:01:13.653 --> 01:01:19.421
Janitor says she sometimes locks
her door and leaves for days at a time.

01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:24.289
Where would I go for days at a time?
I try to put myself in her place...

01:01:43.182 --> 01:01:46.083
Hello, Georgia.

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:52.189
You forgot...

01:01:53.225 --> 01:01:57.025
...you forgot to tie your tie.

01:03:09.335 --> 01:03:12.304
You're sorry, aren't you?

01:03:13.906 --> 01:03:19.310
Should I wash your mouth with soap
and send you to bed without supper?

01:03:20.379 --> 01:03:23.143
Why did you do it, Georgia?

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:26.608
Do you know why?

01:03:29.822 --> 01:03:31.983
Why?

01:03:32.191 --> 01:03:37.288
Because I was afraid
I'd louse things up for you...

01:03:38.297 --> 01:03:40.731
...because I love you.

01:03:41.834 --> 01:03:44.302
I do, you know.

01:03:48.107 --> 01:03:51.304
It's cold sitting on the ground.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.513
Georgia, come here.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.811
Sit down.

01:04:20.139 --> 01:04:24.200
Georgia, love is for the very young.

01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:28.468
"For the very young." I like that.

01:04:30.249 --> 01:04:33.582
Would you marry me, Jonathan?

01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:36.380
Not even a little bit.

01:04:37.189 --> 01:04:40.283
- That's too bad.
- Why?

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:45.055
Because I'd make you a good wife.

01:04:45.264 --> 01:04:49.701
Well, right now I don't need a wife,
I need a star.

01:04:51.804 --> 01:04:54.864
It's cold not sitting on the ground.

01:04:55.074 --> 01:04:58.475
Let's go in by the fire, shall we?

01:05:07.887 --> 01:05:12.415
We're signing Anne Gavery for the part.

01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:17.255
- Oh? She'll be good.
- I think she will.

01:05:17.463 --> 01:05:21.194
Why, that big ham, she couldn't...
Well, she...

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.459
Here.

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:28.163
Jonathan, if we were married,
I wouldn't take up much room.

01:05:28.374 --> 01:05:32.105
Put those things on.
Your clothes will be dry soon.

01:06:06.245 --> 01:06:09.646
- Hello.
<i>- I've been trying to reach you.</i>

01:06:09.849 --> 01:06:13.842
- Oh, Harry...
<i>- You have a picture in production.</i>

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:16.078
- I know.
<i>- We have to get a new star.</i>

01:06:16.288 --> 01:06:20.657
- Harry...
<i>- Listen to me, and don't interrupt.</i>

01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:34.304
<i>Jonathan, are you there?</i>

01:06:34.506 --> 01:06:40.138
<i>- Hello. Hello.</i>
- Harry, forget about Anne Gavery.

01:06:40.346 --> 01:06:43.110
<i>Have you gone crazy?</i>
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

01:06:43.315 --> 01:06:46.910
I said forget about her.
Georgia is right here.

01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:49.314
Everything's fine. We'll use her.

01:06:49.521 --> 01:06:52.490
<i>I don't know what you've got</i>
<i>in your mind.</i>

01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:56.252
<i>- You'll make a fool of yourself.</i>
- I'll take that chance.

01:06:56.462 --> 01:07:01.399
We'll see. I know.
Harry, listen to me...

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.196
Harry, shut up, and listen to me!
These are my instructions:

01:07:06.405 --> 01:07:09.169
Georgia's in. We'll shoot in the morning.

01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:14.506
<i>- You call Whitfield and tell him.</i>
<i>- If I go to the bank, they'll laugh.</i>

01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:21.378
<i>Everybody knows about this girl.</i>
<i>No studio will touch her...</i>

01:07:21.587 --> 01:07:25.216
Harry, shut up and listen to me.

01:07:25.424 --> 01:07:28.985
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:07:29.194 --> 01:07:33.255
- I know just how to handle her now.
<i>- You know how to handle her!</i>

01:07:46.178 --> 01:07:48.043
They're...

01:07:48.847 --> 01:07:50.974
They're blue.

01:07:57.389 --> 01:08:00.381
Blue is my, my lucky...

01:08:09.868 --> 01:08:11.995
...color.

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:27.746
<i>We were 14 weeks</i>
<i>shooting the picture.</i>

01:08:27.953 --> 01:08:31.821
<i>The most wonderful 14 weeks</i>
<i>I'd ever known.</i>

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:34.584
Change that line right there.

01:08:34.793 --> 01:08:37.387
...see him. Up!

01:08:38.731 --> 01:08:42.098
They'll throw pennies at us.
It's ridiculous.

01:08:42.301 --> 01:08:45.395
This is a dramatic moment.
The guy you love is onstage.

01:08:45.604 --> 01:08:49.233
You see him, and you know
somebody's gonna kill him.

01:08:49.441 --> 01:08:52.205
If you're gonna joke about...

01:08:52.411 --> 01:08:57.542
You're not taking this seriously.
I'll try once more, and that's all.

01:08:59.852 --> 01:09:02.286
This mumbo jumbo
doesn't make any sense.

01:09:02.488 --> 01:09:06.219
Try again. Make love
while you're lighting the cigarette.

01:09:06.425 --> 01:09:09.292
Go ahead. Take it.

01:09:09.495 --> 01:09:12.692
Light it.
Look up. That's it.

01:09:12.898 --> 01:09:16.891
All the time thinking, thinking.
That's it.

01:09:17.102 --> 01:09:20.936
That's a lot better.
Wasn't that much better?

01:09:22.374 --> 01:09:24.433
<i>Jonathan was a perfectionist.</i>

01:09:24.643 --> 01:09:27.908
<i>When he loved a scene,</i>
<i>money meant nothing...</i>

01:09:28.113 --> 01:09:31.207
<i>... fatigue even less,</i>
<i>his or anyone else's.</i>

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:36.878
<i>We did it over and over and over</i>
<i>till we could hardly stand.</i>

01:09:49.735 --> 01:09:54.763
- All right, cut. How was that?
- Try it again.

01:09:54.973 --> 01:09:59.273
Jonathan! For heaven's sake!
Fun is fun!

01:10:00.212 --> 01:10:04.581
- Did they get it?
- I don't know. They're still arguing.

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:08.844
Oh, brother!
This is amateur night in Dixie!

01:10:09.054 --> 01:10:11.716
They'll make up their minds
or lose Baby.

01:10:11.924 --> 01:10:15.155
- Hi, Baby.
- You were gonna get me into pictures.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.524
It takes a little while, Baby.
I worked as an extra for three years.

01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:23.462
- This is good experience.
- This is experience?

01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:27.537
By the time I get a speaking part,
they'll have to carry me.

01:10:27.739 --> 01:10:31.539
- You're pretty when you're mad.
- Thanks a lot.

01:10:31.743 --> 01:10:35.804
Wrap it up!
Get these people outside!

01:10:36.014 --> 01:10:38.778
Stage setup first thing in the morning!

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.750
- Good night, Miss Lorrison.
- Good night, George.

01:10:47.226 --> 01:10:49.319
I thought that take was good.

01:10:49.528 --> 01:10:53.430
Pretty good,
but I wanna get more out of Gaucho.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.763
- Happy?
- Very.

01:10:56.969 --> 01:10:59.938
- Are you, Jonathan?
- Very.

01:11:00.139 --> 01:11:04.542
- May I buy you dinner tonight?
- And tomorrow night.

01:11:04.743 --> 01:11:09.339
That's the look I want on that wedding
scene. Can you give me that?

01:11:09.548 --> 01:11:11.607
I'll try.

01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:20.656
Mr. Shields, we're five over budget.

01:11:20.859 --> 01:11:24.795
I need you to sign these sheets
before I can send out the checks.

01:11:24.997 --> 01:11:27.864
Good night.
Hurry up, Baby.

01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:30.364
Be an angel, bring my car around.

01:11:30.569 --> 01:11:34.562
<i>Sí, señor.</i> You want me
to wash it for you too?

01:11:34.773 --> 01:11:36.968
Georgia.

01:11:37.176 --> 01:11:41.442
- You were wonderful in that scene.
- Thank you.

01:11:41.647 --> 01:11:46.050
Every day I watch you grow
more and more an actress.

01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:56.585
To give truth to a performance,
there's nothing like love.

01:11:56.795 --> 01:12:00.492
- Love is for the very young.
- Love is for the birds!

01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:07.901
- Good night, Georgia.
- Good night, Gaucho.

01:12:13.345 --> 01:12:16.803
Lila, that wasn't nice!

01:12:17.015 --> 01:12:20.576
I guess it depends on
who a girl has dinner with.

01:12:20.786 --> 01:12:23.380
Shh, Baby.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:27.923
She gets to be a star,
I get to park a convertible.

01:12:28.126 --> 01:12:32.825
Don't talk like that about Georgia,
or Jonathan. He is a great man.

01:12:33.932 --> 01:12:37.834
There are no great men, buster.
There's only men.

01:12:39.371 --> 01:12:42.397
<i>The last two weeks of the picture,</i>
<i>I was in a dream...</i>

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.974
<i>... a bad dream.</i>

01:12:45.744 --> 01:12:48.713
All right, Jonathan!

01:12:48.914 --> 01:12:50.905
Action!

01:13:06.365 --> 01:13:10.096
- They're ready, Miss Lorrison.
- She'll be right there.

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:14.830
I don't know what to do.
I feel sick and frightened.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.474
You're tired.
You've been trying so hard.

01:13:17.676 --> 01:13:20.839
But they think I'm such a fool,
or temperamental...

01:13:21.046 --> 01:13:23.378
It's only a few more days.

01:13:23.582 --> 01:13:26.881
I feel like I'm gonna scream.
I can't help myself.

01:13:27.085 --> 01:13:30.521
Hurry, Miss Lorrison.
Please, they're all waiting.

01:13:32.557 --> 01:13:35.082
<i>We were on the last scene.</i>

01:13:35.294 --> 01:13:38.730
<i>We finished a little before dawn.</i>

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:42.296
We're alone now.

01:13:43.769 --> 01:13:46.602
And I can talk to you.

01:13:48.407 --> 01:13:53.572
Now I can tell you
what I never could tell you before.

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:59.109
You must forgive me, my darling.

01:13:59.318 --> 01:14:02.253
You mustn't mind my crying...

01:14:03.622 --> 01:14:06.591
...now that it's too late.

01:14:07.259 --> 01:14:10.160
Now, at last, I can tell you.

01:14:11.263 --> 01:14:14.198
I love you, Gregory.

01:14:14.766 --> 01:14:17.997
I love you. I love you so...

01:14:57.442 --> 01:14:59.842
<i>After the opening, there was a party.</i>

01:15:00.045 --> 01:15:02.775
<i>It was a lovely top-of-the-world party.</i>

01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:05.449
<i>It was my party,</i>
<i>and everybody was there.</i>

01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:09.051
<i>And everybody made</i>
<i>a fuss over me. Everybody...</i>

01:15:09.254 --> 01:15:11.620
<i>... but Jonathan.</i>

01:16:03.375 --> 01:16:07.641
You wouldn't come to my party,
so I brought my party to you.

01:16:07.846 --> 01:16:10.280
Jonathan, it was so wonderful.

01:16:10.482 --> 01:16:13.849
Everything you wanted for me.
Just as you promised.

01:16:14.052 --> 01:16:16.520
They applauded, cheered,
oohed and aahed.

01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:20.088
Georgia, go back and enjoy it.

01:16:22.127 --> 01:16:24.322
But there's no one to enjoy it with.

01:16:24.529 --> 01:16:30.126
Why, that's silly. Everybody in town
is fighting to be near the new star.

01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:33.532
You know what I mean, Jonathan.

01:16:33.738 --> 01:16:37.230
Georgia, I have to be alone tonight.

01:16:37.442 --> 01:16:40.036
After a picture's done,
something happens.

01:16:40.245 --> 01:16:45.114
It's a feeling of letdown, of emptiness.

01:16:45.317 --> 01:16:49.720
It's bad. It gets worse.
I can't help it.

01:16:49.921 --> 01:16:54.949
I know. Syd and Harry have told me
about that. But tonight...

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.288
I'd only depress you.
I want you to go back now.

01:16:58.497 --> 01:17:02.399
- You've got bows to take. Take them!
- Darling.

01:17:02.601 --> 01:17:07.402
I was afraid you might be angry
or resent my coming here...

01:17:07.606 --> 01:17:09.574
...but I had to take that chance.

01:17:09.774 --> 01:17:14.074
Right in the middle of everything,
suddenly I knew one thing so clearly.

01:17:14.279 --> 01:17:19.478
The party is where you are:
Depressed or gay or angry...

01:17:19.684 --> 01:17:24.553
...or tender or in any of your moods.
I know them all.

01:17:24.756 --> 01:17:28.157
Let's have our party.
We've got so much to celebrate.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.592
We'll ice the champagne.
We'll light the fire.

01:17:32.797 --> 01:17:35.027
We'll put on the records and dance.

01:17:35.233 --> 01:17:39.397
I'll help you pull yourself out of this
the way you helped me.

01:17:39.604 --> 01:17:42.698
Give me that chance, darling?
Please?

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:47.140
Please don't shut me out.
Please.

01:18:00.792 --> 01:18:03.226
You said you'd get rid of her quick.

01:18:03.995 --> 01:18:05.986
Now, go back to your party.

01:18:08.199 --> 01:18:12.135
The picture's finished, Georgia.
You're business, I'm company.

01:18:12.337 --> 01:18:17.036
Shut up!
Shut up, and get back upstairs!

01:18:22.714 --> 01:18:26.343
Oh, I forgot to tell you, Georgia.

01:18:26.551 --> 01:18:29.145
I saw the picture.

01:18:29.354 --> 01:18:31.822
I thought you were swell.

01:18:34.859 --> 01:18:37.293
Good night, Georgia.

01:18:43.435 --> 01:18:45.767
Stop looking like that.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:48.405
Remember, I didn't ask you here.

01:18:48.607 --> 01:18:51.075
You couldn't stay where you belong.

01:18:51.276 --> 01:18:54.074
You couldn't enjoy
what I made possible for you.

01:18:54.279 --> 01:18:56.577
You'd rather have this.

01:18:56.781 --> 01:19:02.048
Well, congratulations.
You've got it all laid out for you...

01:19:02.253 --> 01:19:04.483
...so you can wallow in self-pity.

01:19:04.689 --> 01:19:09.820
A betrayed woman, the wounded doe,
with all the dribble that goes with it.

01:19:10.028 --> 01:19:12.087
"He doesn't love me. He was lying.

01:19:12.297 --> 01:19:16.097
Lovely moments, tender words.
He's lying. He's cheap and cruel!

01:19:16.301 --> 01:19:20.203
That low woman Lila!"
Well, maybe I like Lilas.

01:19:20.405 --> 01:19:24.273
Maybe I like to be cheap sometimes.
Maybe everybody does.

01:19:24.976 --> 01:19:27.911
Or don't you remember?

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:30.948
Get that look off your face!

01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:35.745
Who gave you the right to dig into me
and decide what I'm like?

01:19:35.954 --> 01:19:38.718
How do you know
how I feel about you?

01:19:38.923 --> 01:19:44.020
Maybe I don't want anybody
to own me, you or anybody. Get out!

01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:46.197
Get out!

01:21:02.807 --> 01:21:07.107
I told you I'd never work for
him again, and I never will.

01:21:07.312 --> 01:21:11.908
I don't blame you, Georgia.
Jonathan certainly ruined you.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:17.214
You were a drunk and a tramp playing
bit parts, and he made a star of you.

01:21:17.422 --> 01:21:20.414
You had an ironclad contract
with Shields Productions.

01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:23.219
Iron, I know, because I drew it myself.

01:21:23.428 --> 01:21:26.955
Starting at $100 a week,
we owned you body and soul.

01:21:27.165 --> 01:21:30.430
The next morning you walked
right into this office.

01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:35.436
That same look on your face as now,
and you threw the contract in my face.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.440
Jonathan let you do with it.
I wanted to take you to court.

01:21:39.644 --> 01:21:42.442
But he said no.
So you signed with ANL...

01:21:42.647 --> 01:21:45.878
...and made them the millions
we should have made.

01:21:46.084 --> 01:21:51.386
For the last seven years, you've been
in the top 10 in every popularity poll.

01:21:52.223 --> 01:21:55.317
Yes, Jonathan sure fouled you up.

01:21:56.394 --> 01:22:00.626
Jim, you're pretty happy
with yourself these days, aren't you?

01:22:00.832 --> 01:22:05.201
You and your Poolutzer... Poolitzer.

<i>Why did I stay away from home</i>

Do you, darling?

01:24:14.732 --> 01:24:16.996
He never minds.

Autograph, Miss Rosser?

Dear Miss Rosser,
isn't this just like a man?

01:24:23.708 --> 01:24:27.439

an author could want...

01:24:27.645 --> 01:24:30.409

...clickety-clack

01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:38.187
I suppose we'll be losing you
to Hollywood now, Professor Bartlow.

01:24:38.389 --> 01:24:43.019
The James Lee Bartlows in Hollywood,
isn't that a ridiculous idea?

01:24:43.227 --> 01:24:47.129
Besides which, what could Hollywood
possibly offer us?

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:50.961
Besides which,
Hollywood hasn't asked us.

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:53.501
What did he write?

01:24:57.442 --> 01:25:02.175
Oh, professor! You shouldn't have!

01:25:03.781 --> 01:25:06.614
Ladies, look what Mr. Bartlow wrote!

01:25:07.518 --> 01:25:11.181
James Lee, you have
a very naughty mind...

01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:14.685
...I'm happy to say.

01:25:14.892 --> 01:25:18.259
James Lee, no.
There are ladies out there. No...

<i>I started to work.</i>

01:25:58.336 --> 01:26:01.305

It'll do you good.

01:26:01.506 --> 01:26:03.633
Thanks, Milly.

Yes, this is Professor Bartlow.

Who?

01:26:21.359 --> 01:26:23.156
Where?

01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:26.694
Oh. Yes, put him on.

01:26:30.134 --> 01:26:33.763
Hello, Mr. Shields.
Fine, thanks.

01:26:33.971 --> 01:26:38.772
I heard on the extension.
Hollywood! Jonathan Shields.

01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:43.478
Sure I'm glad you bought the book.

01:26:43.681 --> 01:26:48.414
I hope your movie of it makes me
as happy as your check did.

01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:52.051
No.

01:26:52.256 --> 01:26:55.657
No, I'm sorry.
I don't see how I can.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:58.852
Tell him you're working on
your new novel. Go on.

01:26:59.063 --> 01:27:02.726
I need all summer
to work on my new book.

01:27:04.402 --> 01:27:08.600
- Don't tell him what it's about.
- Get your hand away.

01:27:08.806 --> 01:27:11.969
I'd rather not discuss it
until it's finished.

01:27:14.145 --> 01:27:18.275
My, just listen to that man talk!

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:23.716
All expenses paid.
You just tell him you'll think it over.

01:27:23.921 --> 01:27:27.823
No, it's impossible.
I can't come out now.

01:27:29.861 --> 01:27:32.421
Say something charming
for goodbye.

01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:37.431
- Goodbye, Mr. Shields.
- James Lee, that was not charming.

01:27:37.635 --> 01:27:40.763
He has enough charm for all three of us.

01:27:41.973 --> 01:27:46.467
- He surely rubbed you the wrong way.
- He surely did.

01:27:48.212 --> 01:27:50.703
Darling...

01:27:50.915 --> 01:27:55.181
...I don't want you to feel sorry
you didn't say yes to Mr. Shields.

01:27:55.386 --> 01:27:59.618
What if we do spend the whole
hot summer here? It doesn't matter.

01:27:59.824 --> 01:28:05.228
Someday, I know we'll get to travel
and see all those wonderful places.

01:28:05.429 --> 01:28:11.197
So don't you ever feel one bit sorry
you didn't say yes, James Lee.

01:28:16.774 --> 01:28:20.369
Does a trip to Hollywood
mean that much to you?

01:28:20.578 --> 01:28:22.068
Me?!

01:28:30.521 --> 01:28:34.287
<i>After all, it was only for two weeks,</i>
<i>all expenses paid.</i>

01:28:34.492 --> 01:28:37.893
<i>It's not like Mr. Shields</i>
<i>wanted me to write a screenplay.</i>

01:28:38.095 --> 01:28:43.260
<i>All he wanted was to talk,</i>
<i>to get my ideas on his ideas.</i>

01:28:45.303 --> 01:28:48.670
- Is this everything?
- Yeah, that's all.

01:28:50.074 --> 01:28:52.440
Mrs. Bartlow, is this bungalow
all right with you?

01:28:52.643 --> 01:28:55.840
- It's completely enchanting!
- Good.

01:28:56.047 --> 01:28:58.914
- The studio car is yours for the stay.
- Thank you.

01:28:59.116 --> 01:29:01.311
I have to meet a guy from the syndicate.

01:29:01.519 --> 01:29:05.649
He's a nice guy,
but he hated our last two pictures.

01:29:05.856 --> 01:29:08.017
- Bye.
- When do I see the great man?

01:29:08.226 --> 01:29:13.254
Jonathan? Drop around the studio
tomorrow. Not too early, not too late.

01:29:13.464 --> 01:29:15.455
Bye, Mrs. Bartlow.

01:29:20.504 --> 01:29:24.065
James Lee, come here.
Hurry up.

01:29:24.875 --> 01:29:27.241
Hurry up!

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:29.675
Come on.

01:29:31.048 --> 01:29:33.107
It's Georgia Lorrison...

01:29:33.751 --> 01:29:37.243
...living in the very next bungalow.

01:29:38.155 --> 01:29:39.850
Now, what do you know?

01:29:41.759 --> 01:29:44.421
<i>That night Rosemary</i>
<i>wrote 32 postcards.</i>

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:48.725
<i>Next morning I mailed them,</i>
<i>and we went to the studio.</i>

01:29:54.572 --> 01:29:58.303
Look here, James Lee.
The dining room at Round Oak...

01:29:58.509 --> 01:30:01.034
...just the way we saw it
when you wrote it.

01:30:01.245 --> 01:30:03.713
Just the way I saw it when I read it.

01:30:03.914 --> 01:30:05.882
Look at that chandelier.

01:30:06.083 --> 01:30:09.348
- It's Waterford, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

01:30:09.553 --> 01:30:13.353
You write in motion-picture terms.
You like movies?

01:30:13.557 --> 01:30:16.890
- The good ones.
- Would you like to write the script?

01:30:17.094 --> 01:30:19.289
- No.
- Why not?

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:21.522
You look much younger than I thought.

01:30:21.732 --> 01:30:24.166
- Must take good care of yourself.
- I do.

01:30:24.368 --> 01:30:28.702
So do I. I'm here for two weeks only.
Get your money's worth out of that.

01:30:28.906 --> 01:30:32.535
There's never been such silver,
not even in Richmond.

01:30:32.743 --> 01:30:35.075
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

01:30:35.279 --> 01:30:39.409
Mr. Shields, James Lee didn't think
it proper for me to come along today.

01:30:39.617 --> 01:30:43.986
The professor's a man of rigid ideas.
We're delighted to have you with us.

01:30:44.188 --> 01:30:50.957
See, darling. I knew it was plain
sociable for me to come and say hello.

01:30:51.162 --> 01:30:54.154
Don't worry, Mr. Shields.
I won't be a nuisance.

01:30:54.365 --> 01:30:57.732
When James Lee is busy with you,
I'll be busy with my own work.

01:30:57.935 --> 01:31:01.029
- What kind of work is that?
- It's nothing, really.

01:31:01.238 --> 01:31:05.937
But I did promise the symposium
I'd do a paper on Hollywood.

01:31:06.143 --> 01:31:11.137
I realize in two weeks I can't do more
than barely scratch the surface.

01:31:22.193 --> 01:31:25.356
Get the feel of things,
and then we'll get together.

01:31:25.563 --> 01:31:28.999
- Shall I phone you?
- No, let me phone you.

01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:36.139
Thank you, Mr. Shields.
It was wonderful fun.

01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:40.538
I like being an author's wife.
It took time to learn the secret:

01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:42.804
His work comes first.

01:31:43.013 --> 01:31:46.176
- Visit us again.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

01:31:47.051 --> 01:31:49.076
"His work comes first."

01:31:49.286 --> 01:31:52.949
She would buy dark glasses
with his first salary check.

01:31:53.157 --> 01:31:56.251
No wonder it took him seven years
to write a book.

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.395
Do you have to have him
to write your script?

01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:04.000
Do you think you can keep him
in Hollywood?

01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:10.368
<i>He kept me, all right. Two weeks later</i>
<i>I signed with Shields Productions...</i>

01:32:10.574 --> 01:32:12.838
<i>... to write a treatment of</i>
The Proud Land.

01:32:13.043 --> 01:32:15.273
- So you like my ideas?
- Yes.

01:32:15.479 --> 01:32:17.913
- All of them?
- No.

01:32:19.083 --> 01:32:23.247
- Who is that? His picture is all over.
- That's my father.

01:32:23.454 --> 01:32:26.287
Angry little man, wasn't he?

01:32:26.490 --> 01:32:31.792
I'm not used to an office. I'm
used to a portable and a soft rocker.

01:32:31.996 --> 01:32:34.464
- Superstitious mind?
- No.

01:32:34.665 --> 01:32:37.634
Supersensitive rear.

01:32:50.114 --> 01:32:54.244
I had them flown out.
I thought it'd make you happy.

01:32:54.452 --> 01:32:58.548
- I gather I failed.
- You were pretty sure of yourself.

01:32:58.756 --> 01:33:02.692
- Pretty sure I'd stay.
- Yes, I was.

01:33:02.893 --> 01:33:05.953
I know the legend. Jonathan Shields...

01:33:06.163 --> 01:33:09.724
...the man will do anything
to get what he wants.

01:33:09.934 --> 01:33:12.198
Thanks.

01:33:13.003 --> 01:33:16.439
Shields Pictures Incorporated.

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:20.098
Well, I'm flattered you want me
and bitter you got me.

01:33:20.311 --> 01:33:22.677
Where do I start?

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.110
Just read these scripts.
See how it's done.

01:33:25.316 --> 01:33:28.877
Rough out a storyline,
and then we'll get to work.

01:33:29.086 --> 01:33:31.350
Don't worry.
Some great movies...

01:33:31.555 --> 01:33:34.490
...are made by people
who hate each other.

01:33:34.692 --> 01:33:38.856
- Then we should make a great movie.
- I usually do.

01:33:39.063 --> 01:33:41.395
What about your last two?

01:33:41.599 --> 01:33:43.590
I liked them.

01:33:50.207 --> 01:33:52.334
<i>I started to work.</i>

01:34:02.953 --> 01:34:03.851
Look!

01:34:10.594 --> 01:34:12.824
How do you like it?

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:16.791
I'll be right down.

01:34:22.373 --> 01:34:24.807
<i>I started to work.</i>

01:34:31.682 --> 01:34:33.775
Hello.

01:34:33.984 --> 01:34:36.578
What is it, Rosemary?

01:34:36.787 --> 01:34:39.756
But, dear, I told you I can't.

01:34:39.957 --> 01:34:45.020
I know it's Sunday, but I've only
written half a page all week.

01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:48.460
All right, Rosemary.
Where is it?

01:34:48.666 --> 01:34:50.600
Yes.

01:34:50.801 --> 01:34:54.066
And?
Not so fast.

01:35:17.428 --> 01:35:19.988
Walking out that way.
You were rude.

01:35:20.197 --> 01:35:22.688
I don't care how you feel about Shields...

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:26.358
...if you are a gentleman, there is
no justification for boorishness!

01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:31.098
He asked me how my work was going.
What was I supposed to say? Great?

01:35:31.308 --> 01:35:35.005
Who was that overgrown bullfighter
you danced with?

01:35:35.212 --> 01:35:37.703
You mean Victor Ribera? Gaucho?

01:35:37.915 --> 01:35:40.907
Why, I only danced with him twice.

01:35:41.118 --> 01:35:46.021
- An hour each time.
- You do get nasty when you're jealous.

01:35:46.223 --> 01:35:48.589
Like the time you carried on
in St. Daniels...

01:35:48.792 --> 01:35:50.885
...over that charming
young governor's aide.

01:35:51.095 --> 01:35:55.225
- He was too charming.
- He meant nothing at all!

01:35:55.432 --> 01:35:58.333
You were even jealous
at that Swiss exchange professor...

01:35:58.535 --> 01:36:00.901
...just because he was polite!

01:36:01.105 --> 01:36:05.542
He was too polite.
Rosemary, let's get some sleep.

01:36:05.743 --> 01:36:10.203
James Lee Bartlow, take a good look
at yourself in that mirror.

01:36:10.414 --> 01:36:12.678
You've changed
since you've come to Hollywood...

01:36:12.883 --> 01:36:17.547
...and I don't mind telling you,
it's no change for the better.

01:36:26.296 --> 01:36:29.094
Have I changed too?

01:36:29.933 --> 01:36:35.166
I dare say I am getting
a little too big for my breeches.

01:36:42.346 --> 01:36:44.314
They're pretty breeches.

01:36:44.515 --> 01:36:48.144
James Lee, you have
a very naughty mind...

01:36:48.952 --> 01:36:51.580
...I'm happy to say.

01:37:49.947 --> 01:37:52.074
Get me Gaucho.

01:37:54.985 --> 01:37:56.543
Harry?

01:37:56.754 --> 01:37:59.314
Oh, call Arrowhead.

01:37:59.523 --> 01:38:03.254
Long distance, please.
Lake Arrowhead, California.

01:38:08.499 --> 01:38:13.129
I'm going up the lake with James Lee.
We'll get this treatment written.

01:38:13.337 --> 01:38:15.271
- When are you leaving?
- In an hour.

01:38:15.472 --> 01:38:19.374
- The bank wants to talk to you.
- Tell them I said you could do it.

01:38:19.576 --> 01:38:22.443
- They're getting tough.
- You're getting too old.

01:38:22.646 --> 01:38:25.240
You got something there.

01:38:25.449 --> 01:38:27.576
Hello, Gaucho?
Just a minute.

01:38:27.785 --> 01:38:32.381
- Harry, you take care of it, will you?
- All right, I'll see what I can do.

01:38:34.625 --> 01:38:39.062
Gaucho. <i>¿Qué tal?</i>
<i>Muy bien.</i>

01:38:39.263 --> 01:38:43.700
How are you booked for social life?
Well, get yourself unbooked.

01:38:43.901 --> 01:38:47.769
How would you like to squire
a genuine Virginia dame?

01:38:47.971 --> 01:38:51.134
I said "squire."

01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:57.447
Mrs. James Lee Bartlow.
Mister is going up the lake with me.

01:38:57.648 --> 01:39:01.812
IKKeep her occupied, Gaucho,
so she doesn't get in our hair.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.054
<i>I started to work.</i>

01:39:15.365 --> 01:39:19.927
<i>I worked all day from 7:00 till noon,</i>
<i>from 2:00 to 5:00.</i>

01:39:20.137 --> 01:39:22.662
<i>There were no interruptions.</i>

01:39:25.175 --> 01:39:28.736
<i>In the evenings,</i>
<i>we worked together.</i>

01:39:31.648 --> 01:39:34.583
Jonathan, that's my best scene!

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:40.014
You've cut it down to three lines!

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:43.716
Look, Jonathan,
I don't think you understand.

01:39:43.927 --> 01:39:48.125
The boy's going away, probably to be
killed! So when the mother speaks...

01:39:48.332 --> 01:39:51.165
She doesn't speak.
We move the camera in close.

01:39:51.368 --> 01:39:54.929
She opens her mouth,
but is too emotional to speak.

01:39:55.138 --> 01:39:57.936
What she feels
we let the audience imagine.

01:39:58.141 --> 01:40:02.077
They'll imagine it better than any
words you and I could write.

01:40:02.279 --> 01:40:04.270
All right with you?

01:40:06.116 --> 01:40:07.947
Yes, professor.

01:40:08.151 --> 01:40:10.915
Now for that last scene.

01:40:16.593 --> 01:40:18.561
- Proud of yourself?
- A little.

01:40:18.762 --> 01:40:21.595
Should be. Not a weak scene
in the whole treatment.

01:40:21.798 --> 01:40:26.201
I'm proud of Rosemary too.
She didn't interrupt the whole time.

01:40:26.403 --> 01:40:28.769
Pleasant, wasn't it?

01:40:28.972 --> 01:40:32.965
To tell you the truth,
I missed her interruptions.

01:40:33.176 --> 01:40:38.478
Even when she's a bother, she does it
in a gay, naive, Southern belle way.

01:40:38.682 --> 01:40:42.584
Why didn't you try to put her
on paper as a woman in your book?

01:40:42.786 --> 01:40:46.017
- I did try.
- Just wouldn't write?

01:40:46.223 --> 01:40:47.520
Funny.

01:40:47.724 --> 01:40:50.955
Maybe you just don't know her
well enough.

01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:16.645
Check the radiator too.

01:41:43.647 --> 01:41:46.207
What's her story?
Gaucho a friend of his?

01:41:46.416 --> 01:41:49.249
Was she gonna marry Gaucho?

01:41:49.453 --> 01:41:52.251
Were they flying
for a Mexican divorce?

01:41:52.456 --> 01:41:55.425
- How long did she love him?
- When did he last see her?

01:41:55.625 --> 01:41:58.890
He was a close friend of the Bartlows.
They were flying to the lake.

01:41:59.096 --> 01:42:02.395
- His flight plan said Acapulco.
- What flight plan?

01:42:02.599 --> 01:42:04.590
Don't you wanna play with the press?

01:42:04.801 --> 01:42:08.635
Gaucho was a friend of the Bartlows.
He was flying her to the lake...

01:42:08.839 --> 01:42:12.798
- Let Mr. Bartlow identify the body.
- Just a minute...

01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:16.275
- Will you shut up!
- You stay out of it...

01:42:45.842 --> 01:42:51.041
I wish... I wish an awful lot.

01:42:51.248 --> 01:42:54.479
Maybe if I'd been here...

01:42:55.519 --> 01:42:58.682
You didn't know about them, did you?

01:42:58.889 --> 01:43:03.258
Sorry, Jonathan.
Of course, you didn't know.

01:43:04.327 --> 01:43:08.627
Look, Jim, I'm not gonna let you
brood about her.

01:43:08.832 --> 01:43:11.801
She's dead, and you're alive.

01:43:13.303 --> 01:43:17.103
You can't do anything about it.
Neither can I.

01:43:18.308 --> 01:43:21.368
Let's get to work, you and I.

01:43:28.485 --> 01:43:31.750
<i>Without Jonathan, I don't know what</i>
<i>I'd have done those next few months.</i>

01:43:31.955 --> 01:43:34.480
<i>He put me to work</i>
<i>and kept me working.</i>

01:43:34.691 --> 01:43:37.125
<i>When the shooting script</i>
<i>was finished...</i>

01:43:37.294 --> 01:43:40.525
<i>... he asked me to stay</i>
<i>for production meetings and casting.</i>

01:43:42.099 --> 01:43:45.796
You see Miss Ronley
as the star of <i>The Proud Land.</i>

01:43:46.002 --> 01:43:49.597
But it was my impression
this was a woman of sex.

01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:52.866
Miss Ronley has
the sex appeal of an angleworm.

01:43:53.076 --> 01:43:56.102
- How about that, Jonathan?
- About what?

01:43:56.313 --> 01:43:58.543
I like Linda Ronley.

01:43:58.748 --> 01:44:01.979
- I wonder...
- Yes, Jim?

01:44:02.185 --> 01:44:05.552
- It's not my department.
- Go ahead. You're among friends.

01:44:05.755 --> 01:44:08.588
While writing the script,
I had one girl in mind.

01:44:08.792 --> 01:44:11.818
She lives next to my bungalow.
I think she'd be fine.

01:44:12.028 --> 01:44:14.622
Georgia Lorrison.

01:44:15.765 --> 01:44:18.632
If you'd like me to give
her the script, I...

01:44:18.835 --> 01:44:23.363
You have just broken a sacred taboo.
You've mentioned the unmentionable.

01:44:23.573 --> 01:44:26.371
- That's enough.
- That's all right, Syd.

01:44:26.576 --> 01:44:30.808
Georgia is the best.
The best actress. The best box office.

01:44:31.014 --> 01:44:34.006
Her last three pictures
for Fred Amiel grossed to... Harry?

01:44:34.217 --> 01:44:37.778
$ 7,600,000 domestic.

01:44:37.988 --> 01:44:43.187
We try to get her, we'll be wasting
our time. She hates my guts.

01:44:48.231 --> 01:44:53.794
Jim, if you wanna show her the script,
there's no way I can stop you.

01:44:55.505 --> 01:44:58.599
What am I supposed to do?
Thank you for saying no?

01:44:58.808 --> 01:45:02.972
What are you trying to do? Fight
Jonathan Shields' battles for him?

01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.809
- It happens to be my book.
- It happens to be his picture.

01:45:07.017 --> 01:45:11.579
You're the first one I know to begin
by hating him and end up liking him.

01:45:11.788 --> 01:45:15.053
- Do you always work backwards?
- Do you still love him?

01:45:18.461 --> 01:45:22.591
- Excuse me.
- Fred, do I still love Jonathan?

01:45:22.799 --> 01:45:28.066
- No, you don't get me on that one.
- A stupid question for a writer.

01:45:28.271 --> 01:45:30.262
Don't you know about first love?

01:45:30.473 --> 01:45:34.739
You may grow out of it,
but you don't get over it.

01:45:37.147 --> 01:45:39.843
I'm sorry, that was stupid of me.

01:45:40.050 --> 01:45:45.886
No, no. I wouldn't want to get over
my first love either, quite.

01:45:46.089 --> 01:45:51.049
Well, it's time you two met.
Fred Amiel, James Bartlow.

01:45:51.261 --> 01:45:54.458
Guess who we were fighting about.

01:45:54.664 --> 01:45:57.997
Jonathan's more than a man.
He's a habit-forming experience.

01:45:58.201 --> 01:46:00.863
If they bottled him, he'd outsell ginger ale.

01:46:01.071 --> 01:46:03.539
- Ready, Mr. Amiel?
- No, thanks, Timmy.

01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:06.300
Georgia let me read your script,
it's a beautiful job.

01:46:06.509 --> 01:46:09.069
I'd like to talk about your next one.

01:46:09.279 --> 01:46:12.271
Goodbye, Georgia.
Nice to have met you.

01:46:13.783 --> 01:46:17.617
<i>Shooting started on</i> The Proud Land
<i>and everything went well...</i>

01:46:17.821 --> 01:46:21.348
<i>... until the fourth day,</i>
<i>then something happened.</i>

01:46:21.558 --> 01:46:23.788
Cut!

01:46:29.132 --> 01:46:32.067
Close-up of the girl.

01:46:32.269 --> 01:46:34.430
About there.
Save all...

01:46:34.638 --> 01:46:39.007
Mr. Von Ellstein!
Would you come here, please?

01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:53.683
Am I to understand
you consider this scene complete?

01:46:53.890 --> 01:46:56.484
- I do.
- I don't. You call that directing?

01:46:56.693 --> 01:46:58.558
I have for 32 years.

01:46:58.762 --> 01:47:01.959
I see values and dimensions
you haven't begun to hit!

01:47:02.165 --> 01:47:06.659
Perhaps not the ones I wish to hit.
I could make this scene a climax.

01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:11.273
I could make every scene a climax.
If I did, I would be a bad director.

01:47:11.474 --> 01:47:13.965
I like to think of myself
as one of the best.

01:47:14.177 --> 01:47:18.307
A picture all climaxes is a necklace
without a string, it falls apart.

01:47:18.515 --> 01:47:22.315
You must build to your big moment.
Sometimes you must build slowly.

01:47:22.519 --> 01:47:25.920
If I want a lecture on the aesthetics
of motion pictures, I'll ask.

01:47:26.122 --> 01:47:31.082
It won't be a cover-up for a shallow,
inept interpretation of a great scene!

01:47:31.294 --> 01:47:35.424
- To be a director you need imagination.
- Whose imagination?

01:47:35.632 --> 01:47:38.100
Yours or mine?

01:47:38.301 --> 01:47:42.795
There's only one answer. You see
this picture one way and I another.

01:47:43.006 --> 01:47:45.839
It could be done your way,
but not by me...

01:47:46.042 --> 01:47:50.035
...and not by any other director
who respects himself.

01:47:50.246 --> 01:47:54.876
You know what you must do
to have it exactly as you want it?

01:47:56.219 --> 01:47:59.347
You must direct this picture yourself.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:07.823
To direct a picture,
a man needs humility.

01:48:08.031 --> 01:48:11.228
Do you have humility, Mr. Shields?

01:48:20.610 --> 01:48:23.443
<i>Jonathan the director</i>
<i>was a new Jonathan.</i>

01:48:23.646 --> 01:48:25.637
<i>He was patience personified.</i>

01:48:25.849 --> 01:48:29.444
<i>He was tolerant, even-tempered,</i>
<i>considerate and indulgent...</i>

01:48:29.652 --> 01:48:32.849
<i>... to his crew, his cast and his writer.</i>

01:48:58.248 --> 01:49:00.682
<i>Six months after he started shooting...</i>

01:49:00.884 --> 01:49:03.409
<i>... we saw the picture</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:07.886
- Nice job at cutting, Tom.
- Thank you, Mr. Shields.

01:49:08.091 --> 01:49:10.685
- Nice work, Tom.
- Thanks.

01:49:10.894 --> 01:49:14.694
- Beautiful production.
- Beautifully written, Jim.

01:49:14.898 --> 01:49:20.029
- Beautifully produced.
- Chapman's photography was perfect.

01:49:20.236 --> 01:49:23.296
Congratulate Walter on his sets,
Lucien on her costumes...

01:49:23.506 --> 01:49:25.940
...and Boris on his score.
- I liked the music.

01:49:26.142 --> 01:49:29.009
Tell the director to have
his head examined.

01:49:29.212 --> 01:49:31.339
He should've shot himself,
not the picture.

01:49:31.548 --> 01:49:35.609
- It's not as bad as all that...
- I butchered it.

01:49:35.819 --> 01:49:39.255
Von Ellstein should have been here.
He would have enjoyed this.

01:49:39.456 --> 01:49:43.483
I have no tension, no timing,
no pace, nothing.

01:49:43.693 --> 01:49:46.127
I took a beautiful, sensitive story...

01:49:46.329 --> 01:49:49.526
...and turned it
into a turgid, boring movie.

01:49:49.732 --> 01:49:52.963
If it were anyone else,
I'd never release it.

01:49:53.169 --> 01:49:56.434
- Who's got a cigarette?
- Here you are.

01:49:56.639 --> 01:50:01.235
I've made pictures that lost money,
but they had something.

01:50:01.444 --> 01:50:04.242
- This is nothing.
- You're being drastic.

01:50:04.447 --> 01:50:07.644
All you've got to do is cut
the dead wood out...

01:50:07.851 --> 01:50:09.250
Please.

01:50:09.452 --> 01:50:15.857
- Harry, shelve the picture.
- Are you crazy? We can't do that.

01:50:16.059 --> 01:50:19.790
We're in hock up to our necks.
We went way over budget.

01:50:19.996 --> 01:50:25.298
- We've got to release it.
- There's your penny-pinching mind.

01:50:25.502 --> 01:50:27.697
Shelve it.

01:50:28.938 --> 01:50:32.465
We shelve it,
that's the end of Shields Productions.

01:50:32.675 --> 01:50:37.772
Goodbye to 17 years' work.
Goodbye to every dime you've got.

01:50:37.981 --> 01:50:41.109
- How about the money in the sock?
- There isn't any sock.

01:50:41.317 --> 01:50:44.753
Your last two pictures
and this one took care of that.

01:50:47.156 --> 01:50:52.321
And every dime of mine is gone
and every dime of Syd's.

01:50:53.363 --> 01:50:55.888
That I didn't know.

01:50:56.099 --> 01:50:59.398
The banks turned us down
on money for the last retakes.

01:50:59.602 --> 01:51:02.093
Syd and I... Oh, well.

01:51:02.305 --> 01:51:06.298
You were shooting,
and who could bother you then?

01:51:06.509 --> 01:51:09.637
The hardheaded businessman.

01:51:11.748 --> 01:51:14.774
The hardboiled press agent.

01:51:16.753 --> 01:51:19.779
I won't release a picture
that I know is bad.

01:51:19.989 --> 01:51:22.116
But other men do!

01:51:22.325 --> 01:51:26.819
Their pictures don't say
"Jonathan Shields presents."

01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:32.229
- Okay, what story shall I break?
- That's easy.

01:51:32.435 --> 01:51:35.495
"Jonathan Shields Lays an Egg!"

01:51:46.215 --> 01:51:49.810
- What you gonna do now?
- I'm tired, Jim.

01:51:50.019 --> 01:51:54.149
- What are you gonna do now?
- You mind changing the subject?

01:51:54.357 --> 01:51:57.622
I just played my big scene in there:
The Great Man Fails.

01:51:57.827 --> 01:51:59.761
You want an encore?

01:51:59.963 --> 01:52:04.423
- You sound like Sebastian.
- Who? Oh, your new book.

01:52:04.634 --> 01:52:08.593
You told me to never let a leading
character feel sorry for himself.

01:52:08.805 --> 01:52:10.966
- Not for long.
- I was wrong.

01:52:11.174 --> 01:52:14.871
It's very comforting
to feel sorry for yourself.

01:52:15.078 --> 01:52:17.478
- You're coming with me.
- What?

01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:22.879
I've taken a cabin at Tahoe to finish
my new book. You're coming along.

01:52:23.953 --> 01:52:27.389
- Why?
- Why not?

01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:30.787
Besides, I work better
when you're around.

01:52:30.994 --> 01:52:33.462
Can you wait a while?

01:52:33.663 --> 01:52:36.723
- How long?
- Five minutes.

01:52:36.933 --> 01:52:40.096
It'll take me that long to pack.

01:52:41.437 --> 01:52:46.136
Sebastian sounds like some character.
You'll have trouble casting him.

01:52:46.342 --> 01:52:51.507
- This is a book, not a movie.
- You'll sell it to pictures.

01:52:51.714 --> 01:52:55.480
Gaucho could have done that part.
He was Sebastian.

01:52:55.685 --> 01:53:00.520
The guy with the world on a string.
The big happy baboon.

01:53:00.723 --> 01:53:06.457
I begged him, "Don't take that plane,
Gaucho." But no, not him. He...

01:53:17.173 --> 01:53:20.802
Today is my day for mistakes.

01:53:22.478 --> 01:53:24.275
Jim...

01:53:24.781 --> 01:53:29.184
...I didn't kill Rosemary.
Gaucho didn't kill her.

01:53:29.385 --> 01:53:31.319
She killed herself.

01:53:33.489 --> 01:53:36.390
Whether you like it or not,
you're better off.

01:53:36.592 --> 01:53:41.495
She was a fool. She got in your way.
She interfered with your work.

01:53:41.698 --> 01:53:44.895
She wasted your time.
She wasted you.

01:53:45.101 --> 01:53:47.934
You're better off without her!

01:53:56.112 --> 01:54:00.310
"A sensitive, unforgettable portrait
of a present-day Southern belle.

01:54:00.516 --> 01:54:06.580
Gay and foolish, naive, shrewd,
and heartbreaking all at once."

01:54:06.789 --> 01:54:10.122
Yes, Jim,
Jonathan sure destroyed you.

01:54:10.326 --> 01:54:15.992
You came out of it with nothing.
Nothing but a Pulitzer Prize novel...

01:54:16.199 --> 01:54:19.635
...and the highest salary
of any writer in Hollywood.

01:54:19.836 --> 01:54:22.771
Look, folks,
you've got to give the devil his due.

01:54:22.972 --> 01:54:26.635
We all owe him something,
and you've had years to think it over.

01:54:26.843 --> 01:54:30.040
- What do you owe him, Harry?
- Plenty.

01:54:30.246 --> 01:54:34.478
All the times he told me
to shut my penny-pinching mouth.

01:54:35.218 --> 01:54:39.917
To Jonathan I was always
just an overpaid bookkeeper.

01:54:40.123 --> 01:54:45.026
But without him I probably would still
be putting costumes on cat men.

01:54:46.596 --> 01:54:50.430
You know, when they list
the 10 best pictures ever made...

01:54:51.267 --> 01:54:54.862
...there are always
two or three of his on the list.

01:54:55.071 --> 01:54:58.097
And I was with him when he made them.

01:54:59.308 --> 01:55:01.003
Excuse me.

01:55:01.210 --> 01:55:04.475
- Yes?
<i>- Your call from Paris is ready.</i>

01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:06.409
Hello!

01:55:06.616 --> 01:55:08.914
Hello. Yes, Jonathan.

01:55:09.819 --> 01:55:12.447
I can hear perfectly.

01:55:12.655 --> 01:55:16.614
Yes, they're here, all three of them.

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:19.792
All right, I'll ask them.

01:55:21.898 --> 01:55:23.866
Jonathan wants to know:

01:55:24.066 --> 01:55:27.934
Will you help him get started again?
Will you work with him just this once?

01:55:28.604 --> 01:55:31.129
Will you do this picture with him?

01:55:33.943 --> 01:55:35.843
Georgia?

01:55:40.249 --> 01:55:42.308
Sorry, Jonathan.

01:55:42.518 --> 01:55:44.509
No, I can't.

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:48.417
I'm sorry, Jonathan.
They're gone.

01:55:49.358 --> 01:55:52.657
I'm sure it's a great idea, but, Jonathan...

01:55:52.862 --> 01:55:55.023
...this costs $4.80 a minute.

01:55:55.231 --> 01:56:00.191
