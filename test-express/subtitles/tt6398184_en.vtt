00:01:34.818 --> 00:01:37.519
All aboard!

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:38.920
All aboard!

00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:04.134
- Morning.
- Special one today.

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:07.537
Blimey.

00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:15.209
What have you got there?

00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:17.879
Wouldn't you like to know.

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.783
Just arrived, milord.

00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:57.819
There's one
from Buckingham Palace.

00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:59.621
Heavens.

00:04:59.623 --> 00:05:01.689
But we really need

00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:03.725
to cut back until the farms
repay the investment.

00:05:03.727 --> 00:05:05.727
And we must make a plan
for the roof.

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.761
Well, this won't help us
to economize.

00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:09.331
What is it?

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:12.367
The king and queen
are coming to stay.

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:14.268
What?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.071
During their Yorkshire tour?

00:05:16.073 --> 00:05:17.739
That's it.
Just for a night.

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:19.607
They'll spend one night
at Downton

00:05:19.609 --> 00:05:21.643
and then go on to Harewood
for a ball.

00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:24.112
While they're here,
there's to be a parade

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:26.247
of the Yorkshire Hussars
in the village.

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.617
Is there any chance
Henry might be back?

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:30.050
Well, I doubt it.

00:05:30.052 --> 00:05:31.653
I'll send a telegram.

00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:33.220
But there's a motor show
in Chicago

00:05:33.222 --> 00:05:34.989
that I know he cannot chuck.

00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:38.994
Tom, you're keeping
your enthusiasm under control.

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:41.730
Is this the Irish patriot
making a reappearance?

00:05:41.732 --> 00:05:44.264
I know you find my opinions
highly entertaining.

00:05:44.266 --> 00:05:47.035
I suppose they'll send people
to check that Mrs. Patmore

00:05:47.037 --> 00:05:49.103
- isn't a Russian spy.
- Mm.

00:05:49.105 --> 00:05:51.138
Will you tell them
downstairs, Barrow?

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.611
- I'll see to Her Ladyship.
- Yes, milord.

00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:58.679
A royal luncheon,
a parade and a dinner?

00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:00.381
I'm going to have to sit down.

00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:02.816
- Oh, what about Mr. Branson?
- What about him?

00:06:02.818 --> 00:06:04.653
Well, he's a republican,
isn't he?

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:06.287
Should Mr. Carson look in,

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.956
no one is to say that word
in front of him.

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.826
I agree with Mr. Branson.
I don't like kings, either.

00:06:11.828 --> 00:06:13.927
I suppose that makes me
a republican, too.

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:15.833
Are the English allowed to be?

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:29.309
<i>Two weeks to get ready? Golly.</i>

00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:30.210
It's quite an honor.

00:06:30.212 --> 00:06:31.946
It is. But if I know

00:06:31.948 --> 00:06:33.715
anything about royal visits,
we will never stop

00:06:33.717 --> 00:06:35.016
changing our clothes.

00:06:35.018 --> 00:06:37.052
I've just been
on a buying spree,

00:06:37.054 --> 00:06:38.686
which is good.

00:06:38.688 --> 00:06:41.021
Madame Handley-Seymour
is making me a ball dress.

00:06:41.023 --> 00:06:43.357
- I'll get her to hurry it up.
- Have her send it here.

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:46.026
- How are things otherwise?
- Oh, you know.

00:06:46.028 --> 00:06:49.230
I've got a luncheon for 30
today in aid of the lifeboats.

00:06:49.232 --> 00:06:50.999
Or is that tomorrow?

00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:52.467
Anyway,
it's in aid of something.

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:54.369
Sounds like business as usual.

00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:56.838
I'll see you soon, darling.

00:06:59.109 --> 00:07:01.141
You know I can bring back

00:07:01.143 --> 00:07:03.143
as many vegetables
as we could eat.

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:05.146
- Yeah, I like to keep busy.
- Yeah.

00:07:05.148 --> 00:07:07.782
How have they taken the news
up at the house?

00:07:07.784 --> 00:07:09.283
Daisy's singing
"The Marseillaise."

00:07:09.285 --> 00:07:11.319
So no surprises there.

00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:14.021
Oh, what's the matter?

00:07:14.023 --> 00:07:15.456
I thought you'd be pleased.

00:07:15.458 --> 00:07:16.990
I am pleased.

00:07:16.992 --> 00:07:19.059
The visit is a great honor.

00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:22.463
But members of the royal
and imperial household

00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:24.499
are coming to Downton
who will have visited

00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:27.102
the greatest houses in the land.

00:07:27.104 --> 00:07:29.136
Blenheim, Chatsworth, Arundel.

00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:31.405
Does Mr. Barrow know
what he's taking on?

00:07:31.407 --> 00:07:33.874
Why should it affect you?

00:07:33.876 --> 00:07:35.343
You're not in charge anymore.

00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:37.414
Now, come in for your lunch
and let me get back.

00:07:46.388 --> 00:07:48.324
All right, sir, here we are.

00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:53.197
This will do very well.
Thank you.

00:08:15.719 --> 00:08:17.518
The Lady Bagshaw, Your Majesty.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.287
Good.

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:23.857
We'll go to the 1844 Room
as soon as they're here.

00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:25.763
Do sit down.

00:08:27.931 --> 00:08:30.465
I've just received the plan for
the tour of Yorkshire, ma'am.

00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:32.066
Yes. It's just been finalized.

00:08:32.068 --> 00:08:33.834
I think we'll enjoy it.

00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:36.170
I didn't realize we would be
staying at Downton Abbey.

00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:37.905
Only for a night.

00:08:37.907 --> 00:08:39.873
There's to be a parade
and a dinner,

00:08:39.875 --> 00:08:43.144
and then we go on
to Princess Mary at Harewood.

00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:45.045
I just wondered
if I might, perhaps,

00:08:45.047 --> 00:08:46.149
go straight to Harewood.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.818
Lord Grantham is my cousin,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.819
and the two families have...

00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:53.353
fallen out.

00:08:53.355 --> 00:08:56.424
Or at least we might
if I were there in person.

00:08:56.426 --> 00:08:59.059
And what would cause
this quarrel?

00:08:59.061 --> 00:09:01.963
Lord Grantham's mother believes
her son should be my heir.

00:09:01.965 --> 00:09:05.400
Old Lady Grantham can be
very hard to resist,

00:09:05.402 --> 00:09:07.267
as I am well aware.

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:09.170
Exactly, ma'am.

00:09:09.172 --> 00:09:10.972
But, surely, they need to know

00:09:10.974 --> 00:09:12.977
if their hopes
are to be disappointed.

00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:18.947
I wish I knew if they like
simple food or fancy.

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:21.149
I can't think
they'll want simple food.

00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:23.483
With that sort,
don't they like sauces

00:09:23.485 --> 00:09:26.487
and everything velouté and
frappé and smothered in cream?

00:09:26.489 --> 00:09:28.289
"That sort"?
He's the King of England.

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.324
There's only one of them
in the world.

00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:31.959
"That sort," indeed.

00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:33.594
Don't plan too much.

00:09:33.596 --> 00:09:35.563
Not until we know
what's expected.

00:09:35.565 --> 00:09:38.131
Well, I know what's
expected of me... food.

00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:41.169
You, too, Daisy. So less
philosophy, more elbow grease.

00:09:41.171 --> 00:09:43.170
- Is the pudding ready?
- It is.

00:09:43.172 --> 00:09:45.405
Oh, Daisy, take the soufflés
out of the oven

00:09:45.407 --> 00:09:46.875
while I find me specs.

00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:48.609
This country needs a shake-up.

00:09:48.611 --> 00:09:50.612
Ah, you should run for parliament.

00:09:50.614 --> 00:09:52.613
Why not?
Lady Astor's done it.

00:09:52.615 --> 00:09:54.515
And so an under-cook
from Yorkshire

00:09:54.517 --> 00:09:56.184
is bound to follow her.

00:09:56.186 --> 00:09:57.452
Well, you've got to have
big dreams.

00:09:57.454 --> 00:09:59.520
But do you have
big dreams, Andy?

00:09:59.522 --> 00:10:01.488
I've not offended you, have I?

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.558
- Why do you say that?
- Well, for a start,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.325
you never talk
about the wedding anymore.

00:10:05.327 --> 00:10:07.929
We'll get wed when we're
good and ready and not before.

00:10:07.931 --> 00:10:10.164
But, you see, I am ready.

00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:13.037
Take those up
before they collapse.

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:20.208
Maud Bagshaw is coming
to Downton?

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.410
Yes, as the queen's
lady-in-waiting.

00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:24.212
Oh, my goodness.

00:10:24.214 --> 00:10:26.481
Why so surprised?
Who is she?

00:10:26.483 --> 00:10:29.119
Well, she's a cousin
of your father's.

00:10:30.552 --> 00:10:33.288
We'll-we'll discuss it later.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.955
You're not
to make things awkward.

00:10:34.957 --> 00:10:36.357
How's it all going?

00:10:36.359 --> 00:10:37.992
Well, Mary's got it
under control.

00:10:37.994 --> 00:10:39.626
Hardly. There's so much to do.

00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:42.429
Who were those men measuring
on the green as we came past?

00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:44.966
They're building the dais
for the queen at the parade.

00:10:44.968 --> 00:10:47.035
- Oh, how exciting.
- Seems rather a waste of money.

00:10:47.037 --> 00:10:48.402
Oh, here we go.

00:10:48.404 --> 00:10:50.505
Isn't that what
the monarchy's for?

00:10:50.507 --> 00:10:52.674
To brighten the lives
of the nation

00:10:52.676 --> 00:10:54.442
with stateliness and glamour?

00:10:54.444 --> 00:10:58.378
To quote Tennyson, "Kind hearts
are more than coronets,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.381
And simple faith
than Norman blood."

00:11:00.383 --> 00:11:04.017
Will you have enough clichés
to get you through the visit?

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:06.055
If not, I'll come to you.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.559
Thank you, Barrow.

00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:15.262
And, now, you were gonna
tell us about Lady Bagshaw.

00:11:15.264 --> 00:11:16.997
Is she a very distant cousin?

00:11:16.999 --> 00:11:18.632
No. Her father was
my great uncle.

00:11:18.634 --> 00:11:20.734
Then why have I
never heard of her?

00:11:20.736 --> 00:11:24.338
Because she chose to cut
herself off from the family.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.342
- Do you know the reason?
- Maybe.

00:11:27.344 --> 00:11:30.545
See, I believe she means
to cheat your father

00:11:30.547 --> 00:11:33.046
of his rightful inheritance.

00:11:33.048 --> 00:11:34.515
She has no children.

00:11:34.517 --> 00:11:36.984
Your father is
her nearest relation.

00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:39.187
I won't have her put
on the spot.

00:11:39.189 --> 00:11:40.354
You're plotting something.

00:11:40.356 --> 00:11:42.991
I see a Machiavellian look
in your eye.

00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:45.760
Machiavelli is
frequently underrated.

00:11:45.762 --> 00:11:48.429
He had many qualities.

00:11:48.431 --> 00:11:50.564
So did Caligula,
not all of them charming.

00:11:50.566 --> 00:11:53.166
What are you up to, Granny?

00:11:53.168 --> 00:11:58.139
Well, ideally, I would like
Maud to see your father

00:11:58.141 --> 00:12:00.174
as the son she never had.

00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:02.577
Will she be the mother
I never had?

00:12:02.579 --> 00:12:06.150
Sarcasm is
the lowest form of wit.

00:12:11.421 --> 00:12:13.521
- Oh. Hello.
- Mr. Molesley.

00:12:13.523 --> 00:12:15.390
It's very late for you
to be out.

00:12:15.392 --> 00:12:17.058
Is it true?

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.492
Is what true, Mr. Molesley?

00:12:18.494 --> 00:12:20.227
Mr. Bakewell said
that you'd warned him

00:12:20.229 --> 00:12:22.195
that there was to be
a royal visit.

00:12:22.197 --> 00:12:25.065
Well, now I know who not
to trust with a secret.

00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:28.236
That we should deserve
such honor.

00:12:28.238 --> 00:12:29.737
Not you, too.
I am disappointed.

00:12:29.739 --> 00:12:31.472
- Ignore her.
- I wonder, do you think

00:12:31.474 --> 00:12:33.540
I might be allowed
to slip on my livery again?

00:12:33.542 --> 00:12:34.809
Would the school let you?

00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:36.644
Oh, they'll give me time
for this, I promise.

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:38.045
Let's wait
till we know our orders.

00:12:38.047 --> 00:12:40.048
What about it, Mr. Barrow?

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.683
Will you let me wait upon
my king and queen?

00:12:42.685 --> 00:12:44.452
Uh, well...

00:12:44.454 --> 00:12:46.286
That's us.

00:12:46.288 --> 00:12:48.055
Good night, Mr. Molesley.

00:12:48.057 --> 00:12:50.157
When we're done,
shall I fetch Johnny

00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:52.160
- or will you?
- I can fetch him.

00:12:52.162 --> 00:12:54.529
How exciting.

00:12:54.531 --> 00:12:56.396
- Thank you.
- They're all mental.

00:12:56.398 --> 00:12:58.833
All this fuss for a man
and woman we don't even know.

00:12:58.835 --> 00:13:00.734
No, never mind that.
I wanted to tell you.

00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:03.471
I've had some ideas about what
to serve at your wedding.

00:13:03.473 --> 00:13:05.409
Stop going on about my wedding.

00:13:16.719 --> 00:13:18.453
<i>We've only a few days left,</i>

00:13:18.455 --> 00:13:21.122
<i>so I spoke to Her Ladyship,
and she's agreed</i>

00:13:21.124 --> 00:13:23.524
<i>our normal rules
should be suspended.</i>

00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:27.328
<i>We won't clean a room
if a family member is using it,</i>

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.397
<i>but, otherwise,
all restrictions are lifted.</i>

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:33.568
<i>No detail should be left
undone, however small.</i>

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.736
I want every surface
in this house

00:13:35.738 --> 00:13:38.872
to gleam and sparkle
by Thursday.

00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:40.674
Blimey.

00:13:40.676 --> 00:13:42.477
Can I have your attention,
please?

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:44.277
Uh, for this afternoon,

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:45.880
Their Majesties' butler,
Mr. Wilson,

00:13:45.882 --> 00:13:47.747
will be coming over
from Raby Castle

00:13:47.749 --> 00:13:49.750
with a lady's maid and a valet.

00:13:49.752 --> 00:13:51.452
To give us our instructions?

00:13:51.454 --> 00:13:53.788
With the royal servants,
are we to wait on them?

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.857
That is what
will be made clear.

00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:58.593
I won't be waiting
on any valets and lady's maids,

00:13:58.595 --> 00:13:59.828
thank you very much.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.795
Before we get hot under the
collar, let's just wait and see

00:14:01.797 --> 00:14:03.164
- what they have to say.
- Amen.

00:14:14.811 --> 00:14:16.280
Mr. Branson.

00:14:41.838 --> 00:14:44.372
Can I help you, sir?

00:14:44.374 --> 00:14:46.741
It's really you I came to see.

00:14:46.743 --> 00:14:49.276
- Oh. Well, how can I help you, Mister...?
- Chetwode.

00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:50.911
Major Chetwode.

00:14:50.913 --> 00:14:53.747
Am I right you're Mr. Branson,
Lord Grantham's son-in-law?

00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:55.583
- I am.
- Oh.

00:14:55.585 --> 00:14:57.952
The, uh... the papers tell me
the king and queen

00:14:57.954 --> 00:15:00.820
will be staying at Downton Abbey
during their tour of Yorkshire.

00:15:00.822 --> 00:15:02.823
Well, if it's in the papers,
it must be true.

00:15:02.825 --> 00:15:04.559
Yes. Great honor.

00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:06.626
Although, as an Irishman,
you may feel differently.

00:15:06.628 --> 00:15:09.362
I know when my parents-in-law
have been paid a compliment.

00:15:09.364 --> 00:15:11.431
Well, there's to be
a military parade, I gather.

00:15:11.433 --> 00:15:13.333
How do you...
how do you feel about that?

00:15:13.335 --> 00:15:15.670
What do you mean, how do I feel?

00:15:15.672 --> 00:15:17.405
Only you didn't say
whether you support them,

00:15:17.407 --> 00:15:20.308
the... king and queen.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.276
I support Lord Grantham.

00:15:23.278 --> 00:15:25.349
Very neat.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.487
Until we meet again,
Mr. Branson.

00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:42.563
Ah, Barrow.
They said you'd be in here.

00:15:42.565 --> 00:15:44.598
Heavens. We can still
put on quite a show

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.367
when we need to,
I'm glad to see.

00:15:46.369 --> 00:15:48.236
Has it all been cleaned?

00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:50.503
More or less everything's been
done to a basic level, milady.

00:15:50.505 --> 00:15:52.540
But we haven't done
the final buffing-up.

00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:53.907
Why not?

00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:56.544
I was waiting
for Their Majesties' butler.

00:15:56.546 --> 00:15:59.646
I thought I'd ask his advice
on what to use on the table.

00:15:59.648 --> 00:16:01.515
Really?

00:16:01.517 --> 00:16:04.618
Can't we decide what we lay
on our own dining table?

00:16:07.456 --> 00:16:09.457
Front doorbell, Mr. Barrow.

00:16:09.459 --> 00:16:10.690
Please, go.

00:16:10.692 --> 00:16:12.395
Milady.

00:16:20.836 --> 00:16:22.837
Greetings, Mr. Wilson.

00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:24.538
Welcome to Downton Abbey.

00:16:34.783 --> 00:16:37.720
Uh, this way, Mr. Wilson.

00:16:50.633 --> 00:16:52.632
The royal butler's
terribly scary.

00:16:52.634 --> 00:16:55.402
Barrow looked like a rabbit
in front of a cobra.

00:16:55.404 --> 00:16:57.070
Oh, dear.
Should I go down?

00:16:57.072 --> 00:16:58.506
They know what they're doing.

00:16:58.508 --> 00:17:00.775
Do they?
They're hideously behind.

00:17:00.777 --> 00:17:03.410
There's a mark on the Blue Room
carpet we can't shift.

00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:05.413
I have no chairs for the parade.

00:17:05.415 --> 00:17:06.981
And we haven't even decided
on the footmen.

00:17:06.983 --> 00:17:09.950
I'm going to have another cup,
if no one's coming up to serve.

00:17:09.952 --> 00:17:11.685
This is nice.

00:17:11.687 --> 00:17:14.088
Princess Mary wants us
for tea tomorrow at Harewood.

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.755
Ugh, I've got so much to do.

00:17:15.757 --> 00:17:17.457
I wonder if that means
the young couple

00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:18.693
have taken over the big house.

00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:20.027
They're hardly
"the young couple."

00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:21.662
Well, he isn't, anyway.

00:17:21.664 --> 00:17:23.998
She always seems
quite shy to me.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.398
A shy royal?

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.533
Is that an oxymoron?

00:17:26.535 --> 00:17:27.770
Anyway, we're going.

00:17:28.937 --> 00:17:30.604
Right.

00:17:30.606 --> 00:17:33.074
I will return to Raby Castle
and come back to Downton

00:17:33.076 --> 00:17:35.608
in advance of Their Majesties
on Thursday.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.877
But His Majesty's valet,
Mr. Ellis,

00:17:37.879 --> 00:17:39.547
and Her Majesty's dresser,
Miss Lawton,

00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:41.348
will stay on,
if that is convenient.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.883
Or they can put up
in the village.

00:17:42.885 --> 00:17:44.984
No, we'll find them rooms.

00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:46.587
Then Monsieur Courbet,
the chef...

00:17:46.589 --> 00:17:47.821
E-Excuse me.

00:17:47.823 --> 00:17:50.691
- Mr. Courbet, the chef?
- That's right.

00:17:50.693 --> 00:17:52.960
We'd be very grateful if you
could make the kitchens ready.

00:17:52.962 --> 00:17:54.627
So, what should I order?

00:17:54.629 --> 00:17:56.364
Nothing.
He will bring it all.

00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:58.566
And we don't cook any
of the food?

00:17:58.568 --> 00:18:00.568
Um, cook for the servants.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.669
Monsieur Courbet
won't have time for that.

00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:04.003
Oh, I see.

00:18:04.005 --> 00:18:05.940
That is something
to look forward to.

00:18:05.942 --> 00:18:07.540
Calm yourself, Mrs. Patmore.

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:09.409
If it's the way
these things are done...

00:18:09.411 --> 00:18:11.878
Mrs. Webb
and four footmen will arrive

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.446
with Monsieur Courbet
the day before.

00:18:13.448 --> 00:18:14.447
Who is this...

00:18:14.449 --> 00:18:16.149
Mrs. Webb, is it?

00:18:16.151 --> 00:18:17.784
She is the housekeeper.

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:20.453
She will also bring two maids
with her.

00:18:20.455 --> 00:18:21.856
The housekeeper?

00:18:21.858 --> 00:18:23.390
While Their Majesties are here.

00:18:23.392 --> 00:18:24.457
And the maids?

00:18:24.459 --> 00:18:26.159
They will make the beds,

00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:28.796
clean the bathrooms...
that sort of thing.

00:18:28.798 --> 00:18:30.664
I see.

00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:34.734
So, my maids and I will not be
involved in the preparations?

00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:37.972
You mean, during the stay,
you'll be the butler, and...

00:18:37.974 --> 00:18:40.040
Excuse me.
I am not a butler.

00:18:40.042 --> 00:18:42.742
I am the king's
Page of the Backstairs.

00:18:44.914 --> 00:18:47.647
So, our staff has nothing to do?

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:49.617
I'm sure they can be useful.

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:52.886
But how can they eat
and get dressed at Raby Castle

00:18:52.888 --> 00:18:55.688
if the chef and the valet
and the maid are all here?

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.124
We have two of each.

00:18:57.126 --> 00:18:58.826
The principal valet
and the principal dresser

00:18:58.828 --> 00:19:00.627
will arrive in advance
of Their Majesties,

00:19:00.629 --> 00:19:03.129
who bring an equerry,
a lady-in-waiting,

00:19:03.131 --> 00:19:05.899
two detectives
and two chauffeurs.

00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:08.469
The other chef goes from Raby
to Harewood.

00:19:08.471 --> 00:19:12.071
Four footmen go with him,
and the other four come here.

00:19:12.073 --> 00:19:13.976
Do you all understand me?

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.681
You can hardly heckle
Lady Bagshaw

00:19:20.683 --> 00:19:22.148
in front of the queen.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.585
Well, I'm just trying
to prevent a crime.

00:19:24.587 --> 00:19:26.953
- Who says it's a crime?
- I do.

00:19:26.955 --> 00:19:29.123
Oh, and you're an expert
in the matter?

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:31.791
I am an expert in every matter.

00:19:31.793 --> 00:19:33.661
You must have some idea

00:19:33.663 --> 00:19:35.796
why she doesn't want Robert
as her heir.

00:19:35.798 --> 00:19:37.130
I have none.

00:19:37.132 --> 00:19:39.133
He is her closest relative.

00:19:39.135 --> 00:19:42.136
The family have held Brompton
for three centuries.

00:19:42.138 --> 00:19:44.672
But she wants to give it to who?

00:19:44.674 --> 00:19:45.806
Charity?

00:19:45.808 --> 00:19:47.140
The dogs' home?

00:19:47.142 --> 00:19:48.576
Well, I would have thought

00:19:48.578 --> 00:19:50.211
the family had enough
to worry about.

00:19:50.213 --> 00:19:51.878
That's not the point.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.213
Well, very well.

00:19:53.215 --> 00:19:55.782
We must try
and discover her reasons.

00:19:55.784 --> 00:19:58.519
Well, what possible reasons
can there be?

00:19:58.521 --> 00:20:02.223
Well, that's what I intend
to find out.

00:20:13.034 --> 00:20:15.269
- Carson.
- Oh, milady.

00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:17.771
Please come in.

00:20:17.773 --> 00:20:19.039
This is an honor.

00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:22.776
I don't want to be a nuisance,
but I need your help, Carson.

00:20:22.778 --> 00:20:24.845
Barrow just isn't up
to the task.

00:20:24.847 --> 00:20:27.580
- Milady?
- He won't clean the silver.

00:20:27.582 --> 00:20:29.716
- Or he won't let Andrew clean it.
- What?

00:20:29.718 --> 00:20:31.784
He says the page of the...
thingummy

00:20:31.786 --> 00:20:34.722
- will choose which pieces to use.
- I see.

00:20:34.724 --> 00:20:37.825
The truth is,
he's in a sort of trance.

00:20:37.827 --> 00:20:39.225
Won't you help me?

00:20:39.227 --> 00:20:40.927
I feel I'm pushing
a rock uphill.

00:20:40.929 --> 00:20:43.864
I'll be there in the morning,
milady. Don't you worry.

00:20:43.866 --> 00:20:46.666
You're a treasure, Carson.
That's all there is to say.

00:20:46.668 --> 00:20:48.237
I'll see myself out.

00:20:51.072 --> 00:20:54.241
- You could never refuse her anything.
- Mm.

00:20:54.243 --> 00:20:56.210
And what about Mr. Barrow?

00:20:56.212 --> 00:20:58.578
Mr. Barrow can like it
or lump it.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.082
Then I'm afraid he'll lump it.

00:21:03.552 --> 00:21:04.952
We have supper
after the upstairs dinner,

00:21:04.954 --> 00:21:06.252
so you've plenty of time.

00:21:06.254 --> 00:21:08.289
Thanks.

00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:11.191
How does it work
with two valets?

00:21:11.193 --> 00:21:13.092
Well, I prepare
His Majesty's clothes

00:21:13.094 --> 00:21:14.328
and uniforms for Downton.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.796
Then, when Mr. Miller arrives,

00:21:15.798 --> 00:21:17.598
I get the stuff
for Harewood ready.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.867
Then I head back to London
and prepare for their return.

00:21:20.869 --> 00:21:23.136
- It all overlaps.
- So, Mr. Miller's the one

00:21:23.138 --> 00:21:24.771
who actually dresses the king?

00:21:24.773 --> 00:21:26.874
Unless he's ill. Then it's me.

00:21:26.876 --> 00:21:28.908
Is he often ill?

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.714
No.

00:21:33.349 --> 00:21:36.116
I think it's rubbish.
They impose, they demand,

00:21:36.118 --> 00:21:38.851
and now we're to be made
nothing in our own house.

00:21:38.853 --> 00:21:41.155
It's very disappointing,
I won't deny it.

00:21:41.157 --> 00:21:42.889
This water's not too hot.

00:21:42.891 --> 00:21:44.191
Have they all been having baths?

00:21:44.193 --> 00:21:46.225
How should I know?

00:21:46.227 --> 00:21:49.797
Mr. Barrow, don't you think you
should speak to His Lordship?

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:51.699
- About what?
- Well, it's not right, surely,

00:21:51.701 --> 00:21:53.232
for us to be humiliated
in this way.

00:21:53.234 --> 00:21:54.801
Well, what could he do about it?

00:21:54.803 --> 00:21:56.169
Is the staff
always ridden over roughshod

00:21:56.171 --> 00:21:57.805
whenever royalty come to stay?

00:21:57.807 --> 00:21:59.706
Why do they bring
so many servants with them?

00:21:59.708 --> 00:22:01.274
Maybe it's because they go
from house to house

00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:02.842
around the county
and they need to know

00:22:02.844 --> 00:22:04.345
things are done
the way they like.

00:22:04.347 --> 00:22:06.312
- As if we couldn't manage that.
- We're not footballs,

00:22:06.314 --> 00:22:08.781
Mr. Bates,
and we don't deserve a kicking.

00:22:20.262 --> 00:22:21.995
<i>But what are we</i>

00:22:21.997 --> 00:22:24.932
to say to Barrow? After all,
he's done nothing wrong.

00:22:24.934 --> 00:22:27.300
He's done nothing at all.
That's the problem.

00:22:27.302 --> 00:22:29.071
But it feels very unfair.

00:22:30.138 --> 00:22:31.371
Oh, I see.

00:22:31.373 --> 00:22:32.905
- So it's now.
- I've sent down

00:22:32.907 --> 00:22:34.942
for Mr. Barrow to join us,
milord.

00:22:36.177 --> 00:22:38.779
You wanted to see me, milord?

00:22:38.781 --> 00:22:40.280
Mr. Carson!

00:22:40.282 --> 00:22:42.182
What brings you here?

00:22:42.184 --> 00:22:44.751
Well, this is the thing.

00:22:44.753 --> 00:22:46.686
Carson is going to move
back into the house

00:22:46.688 --> 00:22:47.923
for the royal visit.

00:22:49.024 --> 00:22:50.657
What?

00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:52.393
You are coming back here
as butler

00:22:52.395 --> 00:22:53.926
when I am the butler here?

00:22:53.928 --> 00:22:56.129
Yes, uh, that is...

00:22:56.131 --> 00:22:58.665
Can I ask how long
this has been planned, milord?

00:22:58.667 --> 00:22:59.966
Well, I wouldn't say
it's been exactly planned.

00:22:59.968 --> 00:23:01.167
Because I don't quite understand

00:23:01.169 --> 00:23:02.802
where it leaves me.

00:23:02.804 --> 00:23:04.238
- Well, you can be a sort of...
- With your permission,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.174
I'd prefer not to be
a "sort of" anything, milord.

00:23:07.176 --> 00:23:09.042
I will surrender my position

00:23:09.044 --> 00:23:11.878
for the duration of the visit,
if I must,

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.914
and serve you again
when Their Majesties

00:23:13.916 --> 00:23:16.183
have gone, if you so wish.

00:23:16.185 --> 00:23:18.051
- Please don't think that...
- By the way,

00:23:18.053 --> 00:23:21.187
the boiler's playing up,
and there's no hot water.

00:23:21.189 --> 00:23:23.022
God, that's all we need.

00:23:23.024 --> 00:23:24.192
Now, Barrow...

00:23:25.961 --> 00:23:28.361
Not to worry. The plumber
will soon have it mended,

00:23:28.363 --> 00:23:30.263
milady,
and we'll bring water jugs

00:23:30.265 --> 00:23:32.265
up to the bedrooms tonight
and in the morning.

00:23:32.267 --> 00:23:33.901
It can't be that hard.

00:23:33.903 --> 00:23:35.802
We did it for 300 years.

00:23:35.804 --> 00:23:37.206
Thank you, Carson.

00:23:38.707 --> 00:23:40.707
Well, that went well.

00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:42.076
Will you sack him?

00:23:42.078 --> 00:23:45.244
No. As a matter of fact,
I was quite interested.

00:23:45.246 --> 00:23:48.214
I never thought of him
as a man of principle before.

00:23:52.221 --> 00:23:53.921
I'll have to tell him

00:23:53.923 --> 00:23:56.022
I'm only ordering
for the servants' hall.

00:23:56.024 --> 00:23:57.960
I'm afraid
I've got his hopes up.

00:23:59.227 --> 00:24:00.493
Aha!

00:24:00.495 --> 00:24:02.495
Oh, speak of the devil.

00:24:02.497 --> 00:24:04.998
Come in, come in. I was
just saying you'll be wanting

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.733
- to finalize the order.
- Were you, indeed?

00:24:06.735 --> 00:24:08.101
Honestly, no one in the village

00:24:08.103 --> 00:24:09.736
- can talk about anything else.
- Of course.

00:24:09.738 --> 00:24:10.937
Oh, now, I know it's

00:24:10.939 --> 00:24:12.940
a bit of a liberty,
but I've made a list

00:24:12.942 --> 00:24:14.441
of all the ingredients
of your favorite dishes.

00:24:14.443 --> 00:24:16.443
I know them well enough
after all these years.

00:24:16.445 --> 00:24:18.779
But some things
will have to be brought in,

00:24:18.781 --> 00:24:20.180
so we should really
get on with it.

00:24:20.182 --> 00:24:21.380
Oh, well, I appreciate

00:24:21.382 --> 00:24:22.849
everything you've done,
Mr. Bakewell...

00:24:24.386 --> 00:24:26.886
My heart is fit to burst,

00:24:26.888 --> 00:24:28.422
I don't mind telling you.

00:24:28.424 --> 00:24:30.790
I shall have fed
the king-emperor

00:24:30.792 --> 00:24:33.226
from my own shop.

00:24:33.228 --> 00:24:35.428
If only my father were alive.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.197
He'd be so proud of me.
He would.

00:24:38.199 --> 00:24:41.367
Well, I-I'm sure he'd be proud
of you anyway, Mr. Bakewell.

00:24:41.369 --> 00:24:43.436
Oh, no, no, not like this, no.

00:24:43.438 --> 00:24:46.272
This is the peak of my career.

00:24:46.274 --> 00:24:49.475
Well, the peak
of my life, really.

00:24:49.477 --> 00:24:51.544
Everyone's so jealous.

00:24:51.546 --> 00:24:53.780
Oh, now, I've put ticks

00:24:53.782 --> 00:24:55.449
next to the ones
I think you'll go for.

00:24:55.451 --> 00:24:57.184
- Now, the thing is...
- I'm guessing the luncheon

00:24:57.186 --> 00:24:58.551
will be for around a dozen.

00:24:58.553 --> 00:25:00.287
Of course,
the dinner will be larger.

00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:02.021
Let's say 30 or thereabouts?

00:25:02.023 --> 00:25:03.857
You'll correct me if I'm wrong.

00:25:03.859 --> 00:25:05.858
- Well, you see...
- You're not wrong, Mr. Bakewell.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.028
But we'll say
if the numbers change.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.296
The pavlova's not realistic.

00:25:09.298 --> 00:25:10.830
We'd be safer
with a charlotte russe.

00:25:10.832 --> 00:25:12.331
We can do most
of the work before.

00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:14.001
And I shall be serving!

00:25:14.003 --> 00:25:15.569
Think of that!

00:25:15.571 --> 00:25:18.305
♪ I've danced with a man
who's danced with a girl ♪

00:25:18.307 --> 00:25:20.072
♪ Who's danced
with the Prince of Wales ♪

00:25:20.074 --> 00:25:21.942
- ♪ I'm crazy with excitement ♪
- No. Stop it, Mr. Molesley.

00:25:21.944 --> 00:25:23.944
♪ Completely off the rails. ♪

00:25:23.946 --> 00:25:27.947
All of my suppliers
are so excited.

00:25:27.949 --> 00:25:29.950
Oh, Mrs. Patmore,

00:25:29.952 --> 00:25:31.518
I shall never be able

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.221
to thank you enough,
not if I live to be 100.

00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:39.126
I feel like a liar.

00:25:39.128 --> 00:25:40.527
I should go back.

00:25:40.529 --> 00:25:42.863
And lower yourself
to a kitchen skivvy

00:25:42.865 --> 00:25:44.364
in the eyes of the village?

00:25:44.366 --> 00:25:46.500
Never mind ruining
Mr. Bakewell's year.

00:25:46.502 --> 00:25:48.467
You'll do no such thing.

00:26:00.616 --> 00:26:02.616
No maid. No valet.

00:26:02.618 --> 00:26:04.917
No nanny, even.

00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:06.453
It's 1927.

00:26:06.455 --> 00:26:07.954
We're modern folk.

00:26:07.956 --> 00:26:10.123
Nanny will take care
of Marigold.

00:26:10.125 --> 00:26:12.392
And Anna can look after you.

00:26:12.394 --> 00:26:14.461
Really? Can she?

00:26:14.463 --> 00:26:16.262
Of course.

00:26:16.264 --> 00:26:19.031
Just like the old days.
Granny's here, and Isobel,

00:26:19.033 --> 00:26:21.467
and we're paying a call this
afternoon on Princess Mary.

00:26:21.469 --> 00:26:23.502
Oh. Has my new ball dress
arrived?

00:26:23.504 --> 00:26:25.239
Not yet, but it will.

00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:27.143
Hello, Mary.

00:26:28.244 --> 00:26:30.277
How are you?

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:32.546
How long have you worked
for Her Majesty, Miss Lawton?

00:26:32.548 --> 00:26:34.313
- Six years.
- How interesting.

00:26:34.315 --> 00:26:36.983
I expect you're a skilled
needlewoman for that job.

00:26:36.985 --> 00:26:38.351
Well, I've had no complaints.

00:26:38.353 --> 00:26:40.988
I trained under Madame Lucile.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.190
Her Majesty wanted
a professional dressmaker.

00:26:43.192 --> 00:26:45.024
And they found you?

00:26:45.026 --> 00:26:47.062
My reputation found me.

00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:52.199
Oh.

00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:54.001
Come on, you two.
It's nearly 3:00.

00:26:54.003 --> 00:26:55.935
We ought to get ready.

00:26:55.937 --> 00:26:57.436
- Will the princess be at the parade?
- Thank you.

00:26:57.438 --> 00:26:59.172
- They both will.
- What time are they expecting us?

00:26:59.174 --> 00:27:01.474
I always find her rather sad,
Princess Mary.

00:27:01.476 --> 00:27:03.242
Well, she is royal.

00:27:03.244 --> 00:27:06.178
Royal women are not meant
to grin like Cheshire cats.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.014
Well, they don't have
to look miserable.

00:27:08.016 --> 00:27:09.249
Well, to you,
she looks miserable.

00:27:09.251 --> 00:27:11.018
To me, she looks dignified.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.618
Doesn't that say it all?

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.155
How comforting
to see you here, Carson.

00:27:15.157 --> 00:27:18.492
What prompted you to take up
the flaming sword again?

00:27:18.494 --> 00:27:21.360
I felt I should go where I
could do the most good, milady.

00:27:21.362 --> 00:27:23.396
Wise words for all of us.

00:27:46.487 --> 00:27:48.924
Her Royal Highness is here.

00:27:52.093 --> 00:27:53.592
The Marchioness of Hexham,

00:27:53.594 --> 00:27:55.529
the Countess of Grantham,

00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:57.530
the Lady Mary Talbot.

00:27:57.532 --> 00:28:00.166
Your Royal Highness.

00:28:00.168 --> 00:28:02.668
Please, sit down, Lady Grantham.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.272
I suppose you're in turmoil
because of my parents' visit.

00:28:06.274 --> 00:28:07.574
I do sympathize.

00:28:07.576 --> 00:28:09.576
We don't need
to explain it to you.

00:28:09.578 --> 00:28:11.677
Just don't paint anything.

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:14.013
They're sick
of the smell of new paint.

00:28:14.015 --> 00:28:16.316
I hope it's not too late.

00:28:16.318 --> 00:28:18.050
Are you living here now, ma'am?

00:28:18.052 --> 00:28:20.419
No. No, we're still
at Goldsborough.

00:28:20.421 --> 00:28:22.688
But Lord Harewood's
not well, so...

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.258
we've come to run the visit and the ball.

00:28:26.528 --> 00:28:28.595
Oh, hello.

00:28:28.597 --> 00:28:30.496
Hello, my darlings.

00:28:30.498 --> 00:28:33.165
How have you been?

00:28:33.167 --> 00:28:35.368
Have you been having
a lovely day? Hmm?

00:28:43.445 --> 00:28:44.677
Yes?

00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:45.981
This is your lucky day.

00:28:47.382 --> 00:28:49.715
I'm the new plumber,
Tony Sellick.

00:28:49.717 --> 00:28:51.617
Oh, yes. Right.

00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:53.956
Well, I'd better show you
where the boiler is.

00:28:55.623 --> 00:28:57.390
Where are you off to?

00:28:57.392 --> 00:28:59.592
This is Mr. Sellick,
the plumber.

00:28:59.594 --> 00:29:01.228
I'm taking him
to the boiler house.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.230
- I'll do it.
- No, you're all right.

00:29:03.232 --> 00:29:05.065
Just tell Mrs. Patmore
where I am.

00:29:09.437 --> 00:29:11.605
Please bring the boys on Thursday.

00:29:11.607 --> 00:29:14.010
Oh, how lovely.

00:29:15.109 --> 00:29:16.409
Why are the children in here?

00:29:16.411 --> 00:29:19.146
We just got back,
and they wanted to...

00:29:19.148 --> 00:29:20.513
They're not allowed in
the drawing room before 6:00.

00:29:20.515 --> 00:29:23.082
- I know, milord. But they...
- Take them upstairs.

00:29:23.084 --> 00:29:24.483
And don't bring them
down again tonight.

00:29:24.485 --> 00:29:26.353
- Yes, milord.
- But they were only...

00:29:26.355 --> 00:29:27.587
Thank you, Nanny.

00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:30.223
- Please, Nanny?
- No, we're going.

00:29:36.598 --> 00:29:38.697
You remember Lady Grantham
and her daughters?

00:29:38.699 --> 00:29:40.166
Lady Grantham.

00:29:40.168 --> 00:29:42.269
They want us to bring the boys
to the parade.

00:29:42.271 --> 00:29:44.236
No. They'd only cause a ruckus.

00:29:44.238 --> 00:29:45.739
We were hoping
you would both stay

00:29:45.741 --> 00:29:47.674
for dinner that night,
Lord Lascelles.

00:29:47.676 --> 00:29:49.145
No, I'm afraid not.

00:29:50.311 --> 00:29:51.677
Well...

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:53.680
I'll leave you to it.

00:30:05.194 --> 00:30:07.661
Well, I suppose
I better let you get started,

00:30:07.663 --> 00:30:10.430
- so I'll be on me way.
- Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

00:30:10.432 --> 00:30:13.299
You don't look as if you need me
to wish you luck, Mr. Sellick.

00:30:13.301 --> 00:30:14.434
Or anyone else, for that matter.

00:30:14.436 --> 00:30:16.536
You don't know what I need.

00:30:16.538 --> 00:30:19.172
And I don't intend to find out.

00:30:25.414 --> 00:30:27.513
Do we need
to cut the grass again?

00:30:27.515 --> 00:30:28.714
They're doing it
tomorrow morning.

00:30:28.716 --> 00:30:31.318
Hello, Mr. Branson. Ah.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.853
Getting ready
for Their Majesties, I see.

00:30:32.855 --> 00:30:34.753
- That's right. This is Lord Hexham.
- Ah.

00:30:34.755 --> 00:30:36.623
May I present Major Chetwode.

00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:39.358
- Are you here for the parade?
- I am. I'm staying at the pub.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.229
- Milord?
- Excuse me.

00:30:42.231 --> 00:30:44.498
Or are you here
to keep an eye on me?

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.501
I was rather hoping you'd be
my guide for the ceremony.

00:30:47.503 --> 00:30:49.435
Would you like a drink?

00:30:49.437 --> 00:30:51.271
I'll join you in a minute.

00:30:51.273 --> 00:30:52.542
Well, well done.

00:30:55.644 --> 00:30:58.310
- Who's he?
- I don't really know.

00:30:58.312 --> 00:31:00.847
Army, perhaps.
Or maybe a civil servant.

00:31:00.849 --> 00:31:02.348
But I'll drink with him

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.884
and try and put his mind
at rest.

00:31:03.886 --> 00:31:05.286
What does he want?

00:31:05.288 --> 00:31:09.522
Maybe to make sure I'm a leopard
who <i>has</i> changed his spots.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.530
<i>What about you, milady?</i>

00:31:16.532 --> 00:31:17.864
- Is everything ready?
- No.

00:31:17.866 --> 00:31:19.633
And my heart is pounding.

00:31:19.635 --> 00:31:21.768
By the way,
have you seen the silver box

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.271
from the table by the fire
in the drawing room?

00:31:24.273 --> 00:31:26.606
My grandmother used to keep
playing cards in it.

00:31:26.608 --> 00:31:28.174
I know the one.

00:31:28.176 --> 00:31:30.210
- Is it missing?
- Yes.

00:31:30.212 --> 00:31:33.413
And so is the little cupid
from the mantelshelf.

00:31:33.415 --> 00:31:35.714
Oh, they must have been taken
downstairs for cleaning.

00:31:35.716 --> 00:31:38.184
I was just coming to you,
milady.

00:31:38.186 --> 00:31:39.685
Oh, don't worry. I'm fine.

00:31:39.687 --> 00:31:42.254
- If that's all, milady?
- I suppose.

00:31:42.256 --> 00:31:43.822
Can you manage the jug
and basin?

00:31:43.824 --> 00:31:45.258
Or are they too heavy?

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.893
No, no, I can do it.

00:31:46.895 --> 00:31:48.861
Oh, how's the boiler?

00:31:48.863 --> 00:31:51.133
I'm sure they'll fix it soon.

00:31:56.271 --> 00:31:58.905
Bertie was with Tom earlier.

00:31:58.907 --> 00:32:02.274
You don't think Tom
would ever try to make trouble?

00:32:02.276 --> 00:32:04.444
Why do you say that?

00:32:04.446 --> 00:32:06.213
Well, Bertie says
there's some army type

00:32:06.215 --> 00:32:07.681
who has him under surveillance.

00:32:07.683 --> 00:32:09.782
Tom likes to shock, that's all.

00:32:09.784 --> 00:32:12.685
He'd never be disloyal
to this family. Never.

00:32:12.687 --> 00:32:14.654
Shall we go down?

00:32:14.656 --> 00:32:15.989
Yes, let's.

00:32:15.991 --> 00:32:17.557
<i>So, I said to her,</i>

00:32:17.559 --> 00:32:19.425
"Listen, lady,
there's a little one here

00:32:19.427 --> 00:32:20.926
- who still needs turning."
- Oh!

00:32:20.928 --> 00:32:22.395
Careful. Mr. Sellick,

00:32:22.397 --> 00:32:23.696
you'll make Daisy blush.

00:32:23.698 --> 00:32:25.432
Takes more than that
to make me blush.

00:32:25.434 --> 00:32:27.434
- Now, get that down you.
- You deserve that.

00:32:27.436 --> 00:32:29.636
- It's very late.
- Well, I've got to get it done.

00:32:29.638 --> 00:32:30.869
And I don't mind long hours.

00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:32.771
I, uh, mean to build
me own business,

00:32:32.773 --> 00:32:35.008
and you can't do that
working 9:00 to 5:00.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:36.509
These water jugs
nearly killed me.

00:32:36.511 --> 00:32:38.310
How did we manage
in the old days?

00:32:38.312 --> 00:32:40.480
Well, maybe people
were tougher then.

00:32:40.482 --> 00:32:41.815
Maybe they expected less
from life.

00:32:41.817 --> 00:32:43.282
Well, I expect a lot from life.

00:32:43.284 --> 00:32:44.783
So do I.
And I mean to have it, too.

00:32:44.785 --> 00:32:46.886
Are you still here?

00:32:46.888 --> 00:32:49.688
Mr. Sellick's been working hard
for hours

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:50.956
for our benefit, Andy.

00:32:50.958 --> 00:32:52.591
Then it's time he went home.

00:32:52.593 --> 00:32:53.993
Is the savory ready?

00:32:53.995 --> 00:32:55.962
Take this.

00:32:58.466 --> 00:32:59.801
Mmm.

00:33:01.736 --> 00:33:04.838
He's right. The new pump
should arrive around 9:00.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.307
- I'll be here.
- So will we.

00:33:07.309 --> 00:33:08.808
Ta-ra.

00:33:16.717 --> 00:33:18.885
That was Mama. She's in London.

00:33:18.887 --> 00:33:21.387
- She's staying with Rosamund.
- She can't be.

00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:23.656
She was here for lunch.
She didn't say anything.

00:33:23.658 --> 00:33:25.724
She went up this afternoon.
She'll be back tomorrow,

00:33:25.726 --> 00:33:27.594
so I've asked her
to come for tea.

00:33:27.596 --> 00:33:30.030
You must persuade her
to leave Maud Bagshaw alone.

00:33:30.032 --> 00:33:31.630
I don't believe even Mama

00:33:31.632 --> 00:33:33.666
will pick a quarrel
in front of the king.

00:33:33.668 --> 00:33:35.335
I wonder if he can come early.

00:33:36.972 --> 00:33:38.838
Are you excited?

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.709
I am a bit. Are you?

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.676
Would it be common to admit it?

00:33:43.678 --> 00:33:45.412
Not to an American.

00:34:35.364 --> 00:34:36.829
Here we go, Mr. Carson.

00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:38.768
Leave this to me.

00:34:42.404 --> 00:34:44.103
I am Monsieur Courbet.

00:34:44.105 --> 00:34:46.072
And this is Mrs. Webb,
the housekeeper.

00:34:46.074 --> 00:34:48.074
Ah. Follow that path,

00:34:48.076 --> 00:34:50.509
and it'll take you
into the kitchen courtyard.

00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:53.445
I said, I am Monsieur Courbet,

00:34:53.447 --> 00:34:55.884
chef to Their Majesties.

00:34:59.587 --> 00:35:01.054
Well done, Charlie.

00:35:01.056 --> 00:35:02.725
Always start
as you mean to go on.

00:35:04.458 --> 00:35:06.395
This way, gentlemen.

00:35:10.165 --> 00:35:13.866
- Miss Lawton?
- I was just looking round.

00:35:13.868 --> 00:35:15.902
It's a beautiful house.

00:35:15.904 --> 00:35:18.570
You've seen many that are finer.

00:35:18.572 --> 00:35:20.005
That's what I came for.

00:35:20.007 --> 00:35:23.409
But we shouldn't be in here,
really.

00:35:25.413 --> 00:35:27.880
Prepare for your
battle with the barbarians.

00:35:27.882 --> 00:35:29.114
Oh!

00:35:29.116 --> 00:35:31.150
You. Uh, where can I put this?

00:35:31.152 --> 00:35:32.619
Don't tempt me.

00:35:32.621 --> 00:35:34.119
We've cleared some space
in the scullery.

00:35:34.121 --> 00:35:35.521
And that cupboard.

00:35:35.523 --> 00:35:37.123
What a lot of fuss over nothing.

00:35:37.125 --> 00:35:39.726
Well, where's our order
from Mr. Bakewell?

00:35:39.728 --> 00:35:42.061
Follow me.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.032
Well, how did you manage it?

00:35:47.034 --> 00:35:49.936
A gardener helped me carry
everything in, so no one saw.

00:35:49.938 --> 00:35:52.471
I suppose you could sell the lot

00:35:52.473 --> 00:35:54.072
and use the money
to pay Mr. Bakewell.

00:35:54.074 --> 00:35:56.009
Don't worry.
They can eat it gradual

00:35:56.011 --> 00:35:58.110
when the visit's over.

00:36:03.118 --> 00:36:05.617
Ah! It's done, Mrs. Patmore.

00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:07.219
The new pump's installed.

00:36:07.221 --> 00:36:08.755
Hail the conquering hero.

00:36:08.757 --> 00:36:10.857
It's Mrs. Hughes
you should be telling.

00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:12.491
Or Mr. Carson. Not them.

00:36:12.493 --> 00:36:14.126
It's all right, Mr. Sellick.

00:36:14.128 --> 00:36:15.829
We'll see the news
gets through. Thanks.

00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:17.831
I would not feed it to my dog!

00:36:17.833 --> 00:36:19.898
But I don't need
your help, Mrs. Hughes.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.601
I just want to know where
Their Majesties are sleeping

00:36:22.603 --> 00:36:24.237
so Miss Stinson
can prepare the rooms.

00:36:24.239 --> 00:36:26.072
Then I will show you, Mrs. Webb,

00:36:26.074 --> 00:36:27.940
because, without my help,

00:36:27.942 --> 00:36:30.944
you will not find them.

00:36:30.946 --> 00:36:32.244
Is it always like this?

00:36:32.246 --> 00:36:34.480
A royal visit is like a swan
on a lake.

00:36:34.482 --> 00:36:37.650
Grace and serenity above,
demented kicking down below.

00:36:37.652 --> 00:36:39.117
I wish I could get away.

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:41.020
I've got tomorrow night off
when Mr. Miller arrives.

00:36:41.022 --> 00:36:42.221
Told my mum I'd look in.

00:36:42.223 --> 00:36:43.956
Why don't you come to York
with me?

00:36:43.958 --> 00:36:45.692
- We could have a drink.
- You should go.

00:36:45.694 --> 00:36:47.826
- You're not on duty.
- That settles it, then.

00:36:47.828 --> 00:36:50.063
I'll come find you
when I'm released.

00:36:50.065 --> 00:36:51.730
We can borrow a car.

00:36:51.732 --> 00:36:54.233
Mrs. Webb,
I am the housekeeper here.

00:36:54.235 --> 00:36:56.134
You are not housekeeper
so long as

00:36:56.136 --> 00:36:57.737
His Majesty is under this roof.

00:36:57.739 --> 00:37:00.639
Yes, but he's not here yet,
is he?

00:37:09.049 --> 00:37:11.518
It's like living in a factory.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.985
It reminds me of our days

00:37:12.987 --> 00:37:14.987
as a convalescent home
during the war.

00:37:14.989 --> 00:37:18.224
I enjoyed that, although
I always feel guilty saying so.

00:37:18.226 --> 00:37:19.992
Where's Tom?

00:37:19.994 --> 00:37:21.860
- Daddy's in the village.
- Again?

00:37:21.862 --> 00:37:24.596
- What's he playing at?
- Oh, I saw Tom

00:37:24.598 --> 00:37:27.166
looking very stern
as I came up the drive.

00:37:27.168 --> 00:37:29.134
I hope he's not building a bomb.

00:37:29.136 --> 00:37:31.070
Many a true word
is spoken in jest.

00:37:31.072 --> 00:37:33.540
We think he's being tailed
by Special Branch.

00:37:33.542 --> 00:37:34.840
Nonsense.

00:37:34.842 --> 00:37:37.210
- Mama, how was London?
- Oh, fine. Fine.

00:37:37.212 --> 00:37:39.078
What were you there for?

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.780
- Oh, various things.
- But you hate London.

00:37:41.782 --> 00:37:43.750
Whoever told you that?

00:37:43.752 --> 00:37:45.784
Now, when do you want me
tomorrow?

00:37:45.786 --> 00:37:46.886
12:00 at the latest.

00:37:46.888 --> 00:37:48.688
They arrive at half past.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.991
But, Mama, you must promise
not to attack Maud Bagshaw.

00:37:51.993 --> 00:37:53.659
Well, I can't ignore her.

00:37:53.661 --> 00:37:55.594
- She is my cousin.
- Exactly.

00:37:55.596 --> 00:37:57.697
Greet her as a cousin,
and leave it at that.

00:37:57.699 --> 00:37:59.998
- I'll think about it.
- But even if she has

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.235
left everything to an outsider,
what could we do?

00:38:03.237 --> 00:38:05.003
Challenge the will.

00:38:05.005 --> 00:38:06.139
On what basis?

00:38:06.141 --> 00:38:07.974
Undue influence.

00:38:07.976 --> 00:38:10.108
But how could you know that?
And how would you prove it?

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.643
We'd find a friendly judge.

00:38:11.645 --> 00:38:13.279
Friendly or corrupt?

00:38:13.281 --> 00:38:15.148
Whichever does the trick.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.882
Are you here

00:38:16.884 --> 00:38:18.284
for dinner, Mama?
It's a buffet.

00:38:18.286 --> 00:38:20.619
- Well, I'm not changed.
- We won't change,

00:38:20.621 --> 00:38:22.288
either, so you just need
to take off your hat.

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:24.757
You talk as if that were easy.

00:38:24.759 --> 00:38:26.092
Where's the paper knife,

00:38:26.094 --> 00:38:28.563
the silver one
with my regimental crest?

00:38:31.799 --> 00:38:33.299
They won't help tonight,
apparently.

00:38:33.301 --> 00:38:35.768
They won't lift a finger.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:39.072
But then, my food
is only fit for servants.

00:38:39.074 --> 00:38:40.739
Well, at least your young hero

00:38:40.741 --> 00:38:42.175
seems to have sorted out
the water.

00:38:42.177 --> 00:38:43.875
He's not my hero.

00:38:43.877 --> 00:38:45.777
Yes.
Why did you call him that?

00:38:45.779 --> 00:38:47.246
Oh, it was just a joke.

00:38:47.248 --> 00:38:50.152
- But why's it funny?
- Oh, Andy, leave it.

00:39:11.873 --> 00:39:13.306
- But this is a rabbit hutch.
- Don't look at me,

00:39:13.308 --> 00:39:14.940
Mr. Courbet. You couldn't
swing a cat in my room.

00:39:14.942 --> 00:39:17.043
Gentlemen, please.
I'm sure you'll find...

00:39:17.045 --> 00:39:18.777
Out of my way.

00:39:18.779 --> 00:39:22.114
I will have a bath,
and then I will decide.

00:39:22.116 --> 00:39:23.983
Perhaps I will find a hotel.

00:39:23.985 --> 00:39:26.386
Where can we eat?
Somewhere apart?

00:39:26.388 --> 00:39:28.387
Uh, why not
in the servants' hall?

00:39:28.389 --> 00:39:30.188
We never eat
with the resident staff.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:31.824
- Excuse me.
- The water's cold.

00:39:31.826 --> 00:39:32.824
What's happening?

00:39:32.826 --> 00:39:34.192
Th-This is impossible.

00:39:34.194 --> 00:39:35.994
We can't stay here
with no hot water.

00:39:35.996 --> 00:39:37.730
- Are you crazy?
- But the boiler was fixed today.

00:39:37.732 --> 00:39:39.766
It was hot an hour ago.

00:39:39.768 --> 00:39:41.867
Well, it's cold now.

00:39:41.869 --> 00:39:43.802
Why are you
here again, Mr. Carson?

00:39:43.804 --> 00:39:45.971
So you could keep control
when I would fail?

00:39:45.973 --> 00:39:47.273
Was that it? I-I forget.

00:39:47.275 --> 00:39:48.741
You... Mr. Barrow,
would you mind?

00:39:48.743 --> 00:39:51.978
I'm not on duty, Mr. Carson.
You are.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.849
Sorry, sir.

00:40:07.828 --> 00:40:09.962
What do you want?

00:40:09.964 --> 00:40:11.998
Since you are in my room,
sitting at my desk,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
it is for me to ask
what you want.

00:40:14.002 --> 00:40:15.300
Nothing from you.

00:40:15.302 --> 00:40:17.036
I would remind you that I have

00:40:17.038 --> 00:40:19.304
been in charge of Downton
for many years.

00:40:19.306 --> 00:40:21.074
Mr. Carson,
you are a retired servant

00:40:21.076 --> 00:40:22.308
in a minor provincial house,

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.277
serving an
undistinguished family.

00:40:24.279 --> 00:40:26.712
Your history
is of no interest to me.

00:40:26.714 --> 00:40:29.882
Now, if you will excuse me.

00:40:29.884 --> 00:40:32.284
So, what would you
like me to do?

00:40:32.286 --> 00:40:34.820
I would like you to find
a good book

00:40:34.822 --> 00:40:36.489
and read it until we leave.

00:40:36.491 --> 00:40:39.862
Mr. Carson, you'd better come
and see this.

00:40:46.067 --> 00:40:47.733
It's well and truly damaged.

00:40:47.735 --> 00:40:49.802
- Can you mend it in time?
- Oh, yeah.

00:40:49.804 --> 00:40:51.036
But somebody should tell them

00:40:51.038 --> 00:40:52.804
someone wanted to wreck
the royal visit.

00:40:52.806 --> 00:40:55.407
They ought to know.

00:40:55.409 --> 00:40:57.375
- Has the dress arrived?
- Not yet.

00:40:57.377 --> 00:40:59.811
- What am I going to wear?
- Carson, what is it?

00:40:59.813 --> 00:41:02.949
Uh, some folding chairs...
well, a great many chairs

00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:04.183
have been delivered, milady.

00:41:04.185 --> 00:41:05.518
They're at the back door.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.918
Anna thought
you should be told at once.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.855
She's right.
They're for the parade,

00:41:08.857 --> 00:41:10.355
and we'll have
to set them out tonight.

00:41:10.357 --> 00:41:12.157
There'll be no time tomorrow.

00:41:12.159 --> 00:41:14.527
The villagers will start
arriving from 9:00 onwards.

00:41:14.529 --> 00:41:16.462
I'm not sure fate
is on our side.

00:41:16.464 --> 00:41:17.829
Poor little Mary.

00:41:17.831 --> 00:41:20.766
Have we let her
take on too much?

00:41:20.768 --> 00:41:22.134
Yes, you're right.
Come on.

00:41:22.136 --> 00:41:23.369
We should lend her a hand.

00:41:23.371 --> 00:41:25.438
Well, you can't go out in this.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.405
Of course we can.
Good night, Mama.

00:41:27.407 --> 00:41:30.442
Remember to pray for us,
mainly for better weather.

00:41:30.444 --> 00:41:31.846
I'll put in a word.

00:41:32.947 --> 00:41:35.248
Of course, little Mary could

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.849
hammer in a tent peg
with her teeth.

00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:39.420
I wonder who she got that from.

00:41:41.188 --> 00:41:43.855
You know, I'm always surprised
when you praise me.

00:41:43.857 --> 00:41:46.793
I'm surprised to hear
that I have.

00:41:49.496 --> 00:41:52.063
As if things aren't bad enough
without a thunderstorm.

00:41:52.065 --> 00:41:54.099
We'll manage.
I've roped in Mr. Molesley,

00:41:54.101 --> 00:41:55.567
and Andy's gone for the truck.

00:41:55.569 --> 00:41:57.436
But, well, Mr. Bates can't help.

00:41:57.438 --> 00:41:59.271
And Mr. Barrow has vanished.

00:41:59.273 --> 00:42:01.873
Ditto. Lord Hexham's
out looking for Mr. Branson.

00:42:01.875 --> 00:42:03.809
We'll have to do our best
without them.

00:42:03.811 --> 00:42:05.177
You're not going yourself?

00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:07.413
Well, how else will they know
what to do?

00:42:07.415 --> 00:42:08.980
Then I'll fetch our coats.

00:42:08.982 --> 00:42:10.315
Well, you don't have to come.

00:42:10.317 --> 00:42:11.851
Of course I do.

00:42:11.853 --> 00:42:14.085
I'll just tell Mr. Bates
where I've gone.

00:42:14.087 --> 00:42:16.021
You're a good friend
to me, Anna.

00:42:16.023 --> 00:42:19.094
I hope we're good friends
to each other, milady.

00:42:25.532 --> 00:42:28.233
- This should be the last of them.
- Great.

00:42:28.235 --> 00:42:29.902
Okay, give me that,
Mr. Molesley.

00:42:29.904 --> 00:42:31.404
- Can you chuck us the rope?
- Here you go.

00:42:31.406 --> 00:42:33.405
- Tie it down, make sure it's tight.
- Here we are.

00:42:33.407 --> 00:42:35.440
- All set and ready.
- Oh, Papa,

00:42:35.442 --> 00:42:37.909
Dickie, you're so kind.
But are you sure?

00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:39.878
You'll be soaked to the skin
and filthy.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.047
Well, what's that to us?
We're hunting men.

00:42:42.049 --> 00:42:43.983
- Come on.
- You don't need to come, my dear.

00:42:43.985 --> 00:42:45.183
We can manage it between us.

00:42:45.185 --> 00:42:47.119
Of course I'm coming.

00:42:47.121 --> 00:42:48.253
Come along.

00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:50.324
Cheer up, Molesley.

00:42:55.864 --> 00:42:57.262
The villagers and guests

00:42:57.264 --> 00:42:59.264
will watch from both sides
of the dais.

00:42:59.266 --> 00:43:01.500
And there'll be seats at
the front kept for the family.

00:43:01.502 --> 00:43:04.003
- I'll join you there.
- I suppose so.

00:43:04.005 --> 00:43:06.639
We'll meet in the high street
where we planned.

00:43:06.641 --> 00:43:09.108
Don't bring anyone.
Come on your own.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:10.942
It's all ridiculous, of course.

00:43:10.944 --> 00:43:13.012
It's a lot of fuss over nothing.

00:43:13.014 --> 00:43:15.614
What? I thought you
were here to check

00:43:15.616 --> 00:43:17.916
I didn't do anything foolish
and spoil things.

00:43:17.918 --> 00:43:20.619
- In what way?
- I don't know.

00:43:20.621 --> 00:43:24.223
Throw eggs or wave a banner
or shout.

00:43:24.225 --> 00:43:26.259
Will you?

00:43:26.261 --> 00:43:28.261
No.

00:43:28.263 --> 00:43:30.563
But I'm starting
to wonder about you.

00:43:30.565 --> 00:43:33.235
I don't throw eggs.

00:43:35.302 --> 00:43:37.306
- Have another?
- Yes.

00:43:39.072 --> 00:43:42.109
- Same again, please.
- Right you are, sir.

00:43:43.543 --> 00:43:45.543
We'll bring a special chair up

00:43:45.545 --> 00:43:47.079
for the queen
after breakfast when,

00:43:47.081 --> 00:43:48.213
hopefully,
it will have stopped raining.

00:43:48.215 --> 00:43:50.416
I shall carry it myself, milord.

00:43:50.418 --> 00:43:53.351
- Well, what about the king?
- Well, he'll be on his horse.

00:43:53.353 --> 00:43:55.054
But suppose it's still raining?

00:43:55.056 --> 00:43:56.358
God will make it stop.

00:44:01.561 --> 00:44:04.262
Is that Tom?

00:44:04.264 --> 00:44:06.364
Has he been in the pub
the whole evening?

00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:26.117
<i>Well, the day has dawned,
and the weather proves</i>

00:44:26.119 --> 00:44:28.454
conclusively
that God is a monarchist.

00:44:28.456 --> 00:44:31.157
Who could doubt it, milady?

00:44:34.395 --> 00:44:36.098
Here they come now.

00:45:04.458 --> 00:45:06.291
Mr. Molesley?

00:45:06.293 --> 00:45:08.059
I'm all right.

00:45:08.061 --> 00:45:09.728
Just need a minute
to catch my breath.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.663
Your Majesties,

00:45:11.665 --> 00:45:13.532
welcome to Downton Abbey.

00:45:13.534 --> 00:45:15.567
We're glad to be here,
Lady Grantham.

00:45:15.569 --> 00:45:16.705
Grantham.

00:45:18.272 --> 00:45:21.040
You remember
Lord Grantham's mother.

00:45:21.042 --> 00:45:24.175
- Hello, Lady Grantham.
- Oh.

00:45:24.177 --> 00:45:25.610
Oh, can I help you?

00:45:25.612 --> 00:45:29.081
Someone must, sir, or I...
I may never rise again.

00:45:30.418 --> 00:45:31.784
Thank you.

00:45:31.786 --> 00:45:35.420
- My daughter, Lady Mary Talbot.
- Hmm.

00:45:35.422 --> 00:45:38.056
The Marquess and Marchioness
of Hexham.

00:45:38.058 --> 00:45:39.558
Mr. Tom Branson.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.128
Lord and Lady Merton.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:43.596
This is kind of you,

00:45:43.598 --> 00:45:45.398
- Lord Grantham.
- Oh, not at all.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.766
It is a great honor.

00:45:46.768 --> 00:45:49.235
I'm sure you know,
but Princess Mary

00:45:49.237 --> 00:45:50.636
and Lord Lascelles
will be joining us

00:45:50.638 --> 00:45:52.237
for luncheon and the parade.

00:45:52.239 --> 00:45:53.605
They're both coming?

00:45:53.607 --> 00:45:55.174
As far as I'm aware.

00:45:55.176 --> 00:45:56.608
What a relief.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.511
Please forget I said that.

00:45:58.513 --> 00:46:00.281
Said what, ma'am?

00:46:05.719 --> 00:46:08.119
- Cousin Maud.
- Violet.

00:46:08.121 --> 00:46:10.121
Are we going to kiss?

00:46:10.123 --> 00:46:12.358
I'm glad you want to kiss me.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.061
It wasn't quite what you said
when I last heard from you.

00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:18.300
Wasn't quite how I felt
when I wrote.

00:46:30.645 --> 00:46:32.610
Can I help you at all?

00:46:32.612 --> 00:46:34.612
Thanks.
The others all shot off,

00:46:34.614 --> 00:46:36.681
and I'm not sure
if this is the right way.

00:46:36.683 --> 00:46:38.650
Just come with me.

00:46:38.652 --> 00:46:40.453
What's your part in this circus?

00:46:40.455 --> 00:46:42.154
I'm Lady Bagshaw's maid.

00:46:42.156 --> 00:46:44.426
Oh, well, then it's this door.

00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:49.094
You just ask for Mrs. Hughes.

00:46:49.096 --> 00:46:51.132
- She'll look after you.
- Thank you.

00:46:55.603 --> 00:46:57.268
Oh, have you tasted the water?

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.172
Only for body.
Never for drinking.

00:47:00.174 --> 00:47:02.775
Ah, this has just arrived
for Lady Edith.

00:47:02.777 --> 00:47:05.376
Lady Hexham these days,
Mr. Bates, but...

00:47:05.378 --> 00:47:08.514
Thank you, Albert.
It's a relief.

00:47:08.516 --> 00:47:09.815
I want the milk now.

00:47:09.817 --> 00:47:11.250
I want the egg yolks now.

00:47:11.252 --> 00:47:12.585
I want the olive oil now.

00:47:12.587 --> 00:47:14.552
And I want
the vanilla pod now.

00:47:14.554 --> 00:47:16.688
He wants a clip
around the ear... now.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:18.257
Careful, Mrs. Patmore.

00:47:18.259 --> 00:47:19.824
Uh, right. Who's taking
this up? Mr. Molesley?

00:47:19.826 --> 00:47:21.860
Uh, there's no need for you
to meddle, Mrs. Hughes.

00:47:21.862 --> 00:47:23.661
- We will see to it.
- Meddle?

00:47:23.663 --> 00:47:25.364
I don't believe I'm meddling

00:47:25.366 --> 00:47:27.900
in my own house, thank you.
Andrew, yes.

00:47:27.902 --> 00:47:30.201
- You take that one.
- But it's not your house, is it?

00:47:30.203 --> 00:47:32.471
So, would you like to go
and sit down?

00:47:32.473 --> 00:47:34.473
- Now, just a minute.
- Uh, you leave those.

00:47:34.475 --> 00:47:35.674
Put them down.

00:47:35.676 --> 00:47:36.909
For heaven's sake,
go after them.

00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:38.511
I really must protest.
My staff are...

00:47:38.513 --> 00:47:40.445
Keep them down here, Mr. Carson.

00:47:40.447 --> 00:47:42.181
That goes for you, too.

00:47:42.183 --> 00:47:44.282
Stay out of our way.

00:47:44.284 --> 00:47:47.355
You've seen Their Majesties.
Let it be enough.

00:47:54.895 --> 00:47:56.695
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute.

00:47:56.697 --> 00:47:58.230
What-what are you playing at?

00:47:58.232 --> 00:48:00.366
Hang on.

00:48:00.368 --> 00:48:02.867
What...?

00:48:05.239 --> 00:48:07.739
Things seem calmer in the north.

00:48:07.741 --> 00:48:09.675
You mean after the strike, sir?

00:48:09.677 --> 00:48:12.777
Yes, if calmer means
more resigned.

00:48:12.779 --> 00:48:14.646
I'm not sure
what the future holds.

00:48:14.648 --> 00:48:17.449
Hmm.
And you, Lady Grantham.

00:48:17.451 --> 00:48:19.751
Were you affected
by the general strike?

00:48:19.753 --> 00:48:24.924
Well, my maid was rather curt
with me while it was on, sir.

00:48:24.926 --> 00:48:28.393
But, you know,
she is a communist at heart.

00:48:28.395 --> 00:48:30.764
So I suppose
it was only to be expected.

00:48:31.965 --> 00:48:34.433
Wasn't the princess joining us?

00:48:34.435 --> 00:48:35.934
Uh, they telephoned.

00:48:35.936 --> 00:48:38.704
Lord Lacelles has been
held up by something.

00:48:38.706 --> 00:48:41.639
Uh, but they are planning
to come for the parade.

00:48:41.641 --> 00:48:42.974
I imagine the servants' bedrooms

00:48:42.976 --> 00:48:44.476
are quite pleasant here.

00:48:44.478 --> 00:48:46.844
Why? Are you worried
for your maid?

00:48:46.846 --> 00:48:48.846
How clever of you.

00:48:48.848 --> 00:48:50.782
Lucy is more of a companion
than a maid.

00:48:50.784 --> 00:48:52.418
I'd hate for her
to be uncomfortable.

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.389
Of course.

00:48:56.456 --> 00:48:57.755
I really have to go.

00:48:57.757 --> 00:49:00.226
You can't embarrass Mama.

00:49:00.228 --> 00:49:03.262
I'm sorry, but you must wait
until we stand.

00:49:03.264 --> 00:49:06.364
Lord Hexham,
how is Northumberland?

00:49:06.366 --> 00:49:08.300
As beautiful as ever, sir.

00:49:08.302 --> 00:49:10.305
Can it spare you, do you think?

00:49:12.572 --> 00:49:14.005
Well, that was humiliating.

00:49:14.007 --> 00:49:16.541
Go on.

00:49:16.543 --> 00:49:19.645
Oh! Well, we might as well
all go for a walk.

00:49:19.647 --> 00:49:21.380
We cannot challenge the way

00:49:21.382 --> 00:49:23.514
a royal visit is conducted,
Mrs. Patmore.

00:49:23.516 --> 00:49:25.451
- I'm not so sure.
- Why don't we all meet

00:49:25.453 --> 00:49:27.886
- back here after the parade?
- Anna, Mr. Bates,

00:49:27.888 --> 00:49:31.657
there must be no trouble or
disloyal tomfoolery of any kind.

00:49:31.659 --> 00:49:33.659
Do you hear me?

00:49:33.661 --> 00:49:36.027
We'll meet in the wine cellar.

00:49:36.029 --> 00:49:37.730
Tell the others.

00:49:37.732 --> 00:49:39.732
Now, I'm walking
to Mr. Bakewell's,

00:49:39.734 --> 00:49:42.300
- if you've any errands.
- No.

00:49:42.302 --> 00:49:44.335
Well, then,

00:49:44.337 --> 00:49:46.337
- we should get moving.
- Ah. - Of course, sir.

00:49:46.339 --> 00:49:48.907
- Yes.
- Here we go.

00:49:48.909 --> 00:49:50.476
Ma'am.

00:49:50.478 --> 00:49:52.478
I'm so looking forward to this.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.346
- Okay.
- Good lunch, I thought.

00:49:54.348 --> 00:49:57.382
What was the king saying
earlier? I couldn't hear.

00:49:57.384 --> 00:49:59.985
He's planning a tour for the
Prince of Wales next March.

00:49:59.987 --> 00:50:02.554
It'll take in most
of the African colonies

00:50:02.556 --> 00:50:04.889
- and finish in Cape Town.
- And he wants you to go?

00:50:04.891 --> 00:50:07.826
He thinks
I'm a steadying influence.

00:50:07.828 --> 00:50:09.762
How long would you be away?

00:50:09.764 --> 00:50:11.462
About three months.

00:50:11.464 --> 00:50:13.766
I can't believe my luck.
Can you?

00:50:21.708 --> 00:50:24.710
I think we're parked
around the back.

00:51:28.074 --> 00:51:29.507
Tom.

00:51:29.509 --> 00:51:31.876
What on earth
are you doing here?

00:51:31.878 --> 00:51:33.445
I might ask you
the same question.

00:51:33.447 --> 00:51:34.746
Go back, or you'll ruin things.

00:51:34.748 --> 00:51:35.947
Isn't that what you're doing?

00:51:35.949 --> 00:51:37.549
You don't know what I'm doing.

00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:38.817
- Who's this?
- This is my sister-in-law,

00:51:38.819 --> 00:51:40.485
Lady Mary Talbot.

00:51:40.487 --> 00:51:42.323
I told you to come alone.

00:51:43.391 --> 00:51:44.659
Leave this to me.

00:52:51.926 --> 00:52:54.395
- Tom!
- Get the gun!

00:52:57.964 --> 00:53:00.498
There he is.

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:05.237
- Hold still.
- Got him?

00:53:05.239 --> 00:53:07.942
Calm down.
You're not going anywhere.

00:53:18.985 --> 00:53:20.652
- Hold still.
- Are you all right, sir?

00:53:20.654 --> 00:53:21.820
- High treason, that is.
- Your Ladyship?

00:53:21.822 --> 00:53:23.255
Why are you even here?

00:53:23.257 --> 00:53:24.989
I didn't suspect him myself
until last night.

00:53:24.991 --> 00:53:26.858
How was I to know you'd
given up on a free Ireland?

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.559
Isn't it free now?

00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:30.795
Not with the bloody Crown
around its neck!

00:53:30.797 --> 00:53:31.963
Get in.

00:53:31.965 --> 00:53:34.532
- Take him away.
- All right, sir.

00:53:34.534 --> 00:53:35.733
I'm not impressed
you all decided

00:53:35.735 --> 00:53:36.869
I was a royal assassin.

00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:38.237
I didn't.

00:53:38.239 --> 00:53:39.704
It was really the others.

00:53:39.706 --> 00:53:40.909
If you'll follow us
to the station.

00:53:42.176 --> 00:53:43.741
Why didn't you tell us?

00:53:43.743 --> 00:53:45.110
I thought he'd come
to check up on me

00:53:45.112 --> 00:53:46.578
and didn't want
to drag you into it.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.145
I assumed he'd back off

00:53:48.147 --> 00:53:50.715
if I answered his questions
and met him for a drink.

00:53:50.717 --> 00:53:52.518
But last night at the pub,

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.887
I realized he wanted to use me
to get close to the king.

00:54:35.962 --> 00:54:38.096
Royal salute!

00:54:38.098 --> 00:54:41.268
Carry... swords!

00:54:54.248 --> 00:54:56.315
Sorry.

00:54:56.317 --> 00:54:58.119
Excuse me.

00:55:00.253 --> 00:55:01.853
We thought you'd miss it.

00:55:01.855 --> 00:55:03.121
I was just in time.

00:55:03.123 --> 00:55:04.590
I don't know why I bothered.

00:55:04.592 --> 00:55:05.657
- Shh!
- Oh, quiet.

00:55:24.944 --> 00:55:26.945
Your Majesty,

00:55:26.947 --> 00:55:28.179
the Yorkshire Hussars
are formed up,

00:55:28.181 --> 00:55:31.016
ready and awaiting
your inspection.

00:55:37.891 --> 00:55:40.858
Where is he?

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:42.927
He's not feeling well.

00:55:42.929 --> 00:55:45.630
Wasn't he out shooting
yesterday?

00:55:45.632 --> 00:55:48.032
- What do you want me to say?
- Nothing.

00:55:48.034 --> 00:55:49.867
You have to let me leave him.

00:55:49.869 --> 00:55:52.940
We will not talk about it now.

00:56:05.152 --> 00:56:06.851
Is that your maid?

00:56:06.853 --> 00:56:09.820
That's right. Lucy.

00:56:09.822 --> 00:56:12.190
Don't you call her
by her surname?

00:56:12.192 --> 00:56:14.291
She's been with me so long.

00:56:21.235 --> 00:56:23.101
It's so strange.

00:56:23.103 --> 00:56:25.237
- He seemed so English.
- And so he was.

00:56:25.239 --> 00:56:26.837
A pillar of the establishment,

00:56:26.839 --> 00:56:28.306
until the notion
of Irish independence

00:56:28.308 --> 00:56:30.041
took him over to the other side.

00:56:30.043 --> 00:56:31.876
That's where I came in.

00:56:31.878 --> 00:56:34.779
He'd heard my sympathies lay
with Ireland and the republic.

00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:36.715
Don't they?

00:56:36.717 --> 00:56:38.150
Not at any cost.

00:56:38.152 --> 00:56:39.750
I'm a law-and-order man
these days.

00:56:39.752 --> 00:56:41.319
That's what you lot
have done to me.

00:56:42.723 --> 00:56:44.288
So, will there be a great splash

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:45.956
all over the newspapers?

00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:47.458
Poor Papa.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.460
Oh, no. You'll find
there isn't a whisper

00:56:49.462 --> 00:56:51.762
about this anywhere.

00:56:51.764 --> 00:56:54.065
An establishment cover-up.

00:56:54.067 --> 00:56:56.737
I don't believe
in conspiracy theories.

00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:03.108
Yes.

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:04.809
- Do you... do you write?
- I try.

00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:06.844
Ah, Miss Smith.
Did Mrs. Hughes sort you out?

00:57:06.846 --> 00:57:08.980
She did.

00:57:08.982 --> 00:57:11.849
And have you enjoyed the parade?

00:57:13.987 --> 00:57:15.786
Do you work at the house?

00:57:15.788 --> 00:57:17.121
Not exactly.

00:57:17.123 --> 00:57:19.424
I sell cars,
and I help with the estate.

00:57:19.426 --> 00:57:21.793
Lord Grantham
is my father-in-law.

00:57:21.795 --> 00:57:23.228
Oh, I do beg your pardon, sir.

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:26.197
Oh, no, please, let me explain.

00:57:26.199 --> 00:57:28.900
I started here as a chauffeur.

00:57:28.902 --> 00:57:30.501
You must be
Lady Sybil's husband.

00:57:30.503 --> 00:57:32.003
I am.

00:57:32.005 --> 00:57:33.971
Lady Bagshaw and I
followed the story.

00:57:33.973 --> 00:57:35.873
We were so sad when she died.

00:57:35.875 --> 00:57:37.375
How long ago was it?

00:57:37.377 --> 00:57:39.143
Seven years, or nearly.

00:57:39.145 --> 00:57:41.313
- My God.
- I'm sorry.

00:57:41.315 --> 00:57:43.982
- It's still painful.
- Not in that way.

00:57:43.984 --> 00:57:47.351
It doesn't hurt anymore,
but it's still there.

00:57:47.353 --> 00:57:50.288
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:53.824
Was it hard,
coming up like that?

00:57:53.826 --> 00:57:55.427
Joining the family.

00:57:55.429 --> 00:57:57.862
Very hard.

00:57:57.864 --> 00:57:59.931
Between my old world
and the new one,

00:57:59.933 --> 00:58:01.766
sometimes I didn't know
who I was.

00:58:01.768 --> 00:58:03.268
But you do now?

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:05.270
I think so, yes.

00:58:05.272 --> 00:58:07.338
I came to terms with it.

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:08.873
Why?

00:58:08.875 --> 00:58:11.078
I'm just curious.

00:58:18.819 --> 00:58:20.284
Quickly, everyone. Quick.

00:58:20.286 --> 00:58:22.520
Come on. Quickly, Mr. Barrow.

00:58:22.522 --> 00:58:24.422
Can somebody tell me
what's going on? Anna?

00:58:24.424 --> 00:58:26.224
- Shh!
- What's going on?

00:58:26.226 --> 00:58:27.826
What are we all
doing down here?

00:58:27.828 --> 00:58:29.427
Shh. Go inside.
They can't hear us in there.

00:58:29.429 --> 00:58:31.329
This is most improper.

00:58:31.331 --> 00:58:33.431
Yes, why-why have you
got us all here?

00:58:33.433 --> 00:58:35.000
- Yeah.
- I will tell you.

00:58:35.002 --> 00:58:37.168
Mr. Bates and I...

00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:40.005
we want to defend
Downton's honor.

00:58:40.007 --> 00:58:41.405
In what way?

00:58:41.407 --> 00:58:43.340
Would you like a repeat
of how you were all

00:58:43.342 --> 00:58:44.509
treated at luncheon?

00:58:44.511 --> 00:58:45.976
No, I bloody well would not.

00:58:45.978 --> 00:58:47.179
Andrew,
there are ladies present.

00:58:47.181 --> 00:58:49.181
We think we should fight back.

00:58:49.183 --> 00:58:50.549
I don't like the sound of this.

00:58:50.551 --> 00:58:52.550
I do not like this at all.

00:58:52.552 --> 00:58:54.386
Anna, tell them.

00:58:54.388 --> 00:58:57.521
We are going to clear the way
so you cook and serve dinner

00:58:57.523 --> 00:59:00.090
for the king and queen
at Downton Abbey.

00:59:00.092 --> 00:59:02.194
As you should.

00:59:02.196 --> 00:59:04.829
Well, oh, my God,
is this a revolution?

00:59:04.831 --> 00:59:06.398
Shall I fetch the pitchforks?

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.065
No, we're serious, Mr. Moseley.

00:59:08.067 --> 00:59:09.601
But do you know
what Mr. Courbet's

00:59:09.603 --> 00:59:11.369
brought in for tonight?

00:59:11.371 --> 00:59:13.605
Mm, never mind that.
We've got our own supplies.

00:59:13.607 --> 00:59:15.206
And you can leave
Mr. Courbet to me.

00:59:15.208 --> 00:59:17.509
What do you want us to do?

00:59:17.511 --> 00:59:19.110
Don't bother with the maids
and valets.

00:59:19.112 --> 00:59:20.478
We've no quarrel with them.

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.380
But we need to get rid
of the royal butler

00:59:22.382 --> 00:59:24.114
- for the night.
- The Page of the Backstairs,

00:59:24.116 --> 00:59:25.851
if you don't mind, Mr. Bates.

00:59:25.853 --> 00:59:27.886
And the footmen need to be
out of commission

00:59:27.888 --> 00:59:29.587
from 7:00 until you finish
serving them.

00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:31.355
This is treason.

00:59:31.357 --> 00:59:32.590
Well, what can we do about 'em?

00:59:32.592 --> 00:59:34.092
Well, we could lock them
in the attic.

00:59:34.094 --> 00:59:36.027
Any more talk like that,

00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:38.429
and we'll all end up
in Botany Bay.

00:59:38.431 --> 00:59:39.965
And did you enjoy

00:59:39.967 --> 00:59:41.599
being pushed around
and passed over

00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:45.003
and told to stay down here
by Mr. Wilson?

00:59:45.005 --> 00:59:46.971
I will play
no active part in this.

00:59:46.973 --> 00:59:49.007
Well, suppose His Majesty sees

00:59:49.009 --> 00:59:50.442
what's going on
and is displeased.

00:59:50.444 --> 00:59:52.009
Why? Do you think

00:59:52.011 --> 00:59:54.246
I'm not capable of cooking
a decent dinner?

00:59:54.248 --> 00:59:56.146
Oh, no, of course not.
But-but I...

00:59:56.148 --> 00:59:58.016
I'll see to the footmen.

00:59:58.018 --> 00:59:59.451
What are you going to do?

00:59:59.453 --> 01:00:01.319
You'll find out.

01:00:01.321 --> 01:00:03.889
So, does this mean
we're back on duty after all?

01:00:03.891 --> 01:00:06.324
- Me and Mr. Moseley?
- And Albert as well.

01:00:06.326 --> 01:00:08.326
You know where to find
the state liveries.

01:00:08.328 --> 01:00:10.161
Right.

01:00:10.163 --> 01:00:12.230
- Well, come on, Daisy.
- Will I pour wine

01:00:12.232 --> 01:00:14.199
for the queen's sweet lips?

01:00:14.201 --> 01:00:16.967
Any more of that,
and we'll lock you in the attic.

01:00:16.969 --> 01:00:18.168
I don't know why
you're bothering.

01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:19.536
What about that Mrs. Webb

01:00:19.538 --> 01:00:21.105
who keeps telling us
she's the housekeeper?

01:00:21.107 --> 01:00:22.440
Don't you worry about Mrs. Webb.

01:00:22.442 --> 01:00:24.576
I am more than a match
for Mrs. Webb.

01:00:28.248 --> 01:00:30.181
<i>I still don't know</i>

01:00:30.183 --> 01:00:31.983
how you're going to manage
Mr. Courbet.

01:00:31.985 --> 01:00:33.951
Well, there's, um...

01:00:33.953 --> 01:00:35.987
I'm just going upstairs
to lie down.

01:00:35.989 --> 01:00:38.322
Can you get things ready
for when I come back?

01:00:38.324 --> 01:00:41.192
When will that be, O Mighty One?

01:00:41.194 --> 01:00:43.561
Wake me in half an hour

01:00:43.563 --> 01:00:46.965
if I'm not already
in the kitchen.

01:00:49.603 --> 01:00:51.272
Trust us.

01:00:55.007 --> 01:00:57.074
Tell us about your maid.

01:00:57.076 --> 01:00:58.944
Lucy is the daughter of...

01:00:58.946 --> 01:01:00.545
David's army servant,
Jack Smith.

01:01:00.547 --> 01:01:03.648
And, like my husband,
he died in the Boer Wars.

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.650
So you looked after his child?

01:01:05.652 --> 01:01:07.451
Lucy had no mother, you see.

01:01:07.453 --> 01:01:08.987
So I gave her a home.

01:01:08.989 --> 01:01:10.956
That's very generous.

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:14.458
Generosity that has been amply
returned, I can assure you.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.594
I'm glad.

01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:19.266
You don't sound very glad.

01:02:03.143 --> 01:02:06.043
Oh, goodness.

01:02:06.045 --> 01:02:08.779
I thought everyone
was in the drawing room.

01:02:08.781 --> 01:02:11.349
I've been dodging it,
I'm afraid.

01:02:11.351 --> 01:02:14.284
I suppose I ought to get back.

01:02:14.286 --> 01:02:16.154
Can I get someone for you?

01:02:16.156 --> 01:02:18.223
No, thank you.

01:02:18.225 --> 01:02:20.791
You're the widower of the
youngest daughter, aren't you?

01:02:20.793 --> 01:02:22.427
I've heard of you, Mister...

01:02:22.429 --> 01:02:23.795
Branson.

01:02:23.797 --> 01:02:26.096
Tom Branson.

01:02:26.098 --> 01:02:28.199
And who are you?
Ah, I should know,

01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:30.201
but I'm no good
at that sort of thing.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:35.172
Well, I suppose you can't
be expected to know everyone.

01:02:35.174 --> 01:02:37.375
Mm.

01:02:37.377 --> 01:02:39.476
Did you enjoy the parade?

01:02:39.478 --> 01:02:41.478
I'm afraid
I missed it completely.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.813
I got distracted.

01:02:42.815 --> 01:02:44.815
- What a shame.
- Well, to be honest,

01:02:44.817 --> 01:02:46.483
I'm not much of a royalist.

01:02:46.485 --> 01:02:48.052
Although I probably
shouldn't say that out loud.

01:02:48.054 --> 01:02:51.422
Certainly not to a stranger.

01:02:51.424 --> 01:02:53.090
That seems odd, as the Crawleys

01:02:53.092 --> 01:02:55.159
would die for the Crown
if they had to.

01:02:55.161 --> 01:02:57.661
You can love people
you disagree with.

01:02:57.663 --> 01:03:00.230
And you love them?

01:03:00.232 --> 01:03:02.833
They're decent at the core.

01:03:02.835 --> 01:03:06.204
People can be decent at the core
but very difficult to live with.

01:03:06.206 --> 01:03:07.639
True enough.

01:03:07.641 --> 01:03:10.340
And they're silly, too,
and snobbish at times.

01:03:10.342 --> 01:03:13.244
And I wouldn't give tuppence
for their politics.

01:03:13.246 --> 01:03:16.081
But I've learned to be happy
with all of that.

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:18.215
And besides...

01:03:18.217 --> 01:03:20.819
they're my daughter's family.

01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:24.422
And she lives here?

01:03:24.424 --> 01:03:28.326
I nearly took her away once.

01:03:28.328 --> 01:03:31.228
But she belongs here now.

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.199
I spent so much of my life
not belonging anywhere.

01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:36.536
That's important to me.

01:03:38.605 --> 01:03:41.172
I suppose, in the end,
it's deciding

01:03:41.174 --> 01:03:43.543
what's important, isn't it?

01:03:46.378 --> 01:03:49.346
You've given me a great deal
to think about, Mr. Branson.

01:03:49.348 --> 01:03:50.882
Good things, I hope.

01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:53.684
That may be so, but...

01:03:53.686 --> 01:03:56.156
now we must go in.

01:04:02.128 --> 01:04:03.494
We must change.

01:04:03.496 --> 01:04:05.295
And you leave in the morning.

01:04:05.297 --> 01:04:07.599
I wonder if we might have
a talk later.

01:04:07.601 --> 01:04:08.833
We'll find a cozy spot.

01:04:08.835 --> 01:04:10.869
And Robert can join us.

01:04:10.871 --> 01:04:12.737
I won't be interrogated, Violet.

01:04:12.739 --> 01:04:16.808
Please, don't miss the chance
to settle things between you.

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:18.742
Very well.

01:04:18.744 --> 01:04:20.777
But now I must go.

01:04:25.719 --> 01:04:28.152
That was helpful.
Thank you.

01:04:28.154 --> 01:04:29.786
Well, I told you
I wanted to help.

01:04:29.788 --> 01:04:32.359
Well, thanks to you,
we have her cornered.

01:04:37.197 --> 01:04:38.862
Mr. Wilson.

01:04:38.864 --> 01:04:40.898
There's a telephone call
for you.

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.766
For me?

01:04:42.768 --> 01:04:45.536
But, Sir Harry, they wouldn't
get to London until 9:00.

01:04:45.538 --> 01:04:47.172
It doesn't matter.

01:04:47.174 --> 01:04:49.373
The ball at Clarence House
won't start till 10:00.

01:04:49.375 --> 01:04:51.375
What ball at Clarence House?

01:04:51.377 --> 01:04:52.876
The Duke of Connaught's.

01:04:52.878 --> 01:04:54.712
What are you playing at, Wilson?

01:04:54.714 --> 01:04:56.280
I'm not questioning you, sir,

01:04:56.282 --> 01:04:58.349
not if it's what
the Duke of Connaught wishes.

01:04:58.351 --> 01:05:00.284
But how do I manage here?

01:05:00.286 --> 01:05:02.186
Don't they have footmen
at Downton?

01:05:02.188 --> 01:05:04.822
Yes, there are footmen.
But won't His Majesty...

01:05:04.824 --> 01:05:07.224
His Majesty won't give
a tinker's cuss!

01:05:07.226 --> 01:05:10.663
- Now, do as I say.
- Of course, Sir Harry. At once.

01:05:16.569 --> 01:05:18.802
Everything all right,
Mr. Wilson?

01:05:18.804 --> 01:05:20.471
I need to see my footmen

01:05:20.473 --> 01:05:22.607
and the house footmen
and the hall boy.

01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:24.808
Uh, when is the next train
to London?

01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:26.513
I hope it's not bad news.

01:05:28.248 --> 01:05:30.848
Not bad, exactly.

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:33.217
But irregular.

01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:35.522
Very irregular, indeed.

01:05:38.991 --> 01:05:42.360
I'll get drummed out of the
regiment if they ever find out.

01:05:42.362 --> 01:05:44.362
Well, you sounded
convincing to me.

01:05:44.364 --> 01:05:46.431
Oh, I'm very good
at doing Sir Harry Barnston,

01:05:46.433 --> 01:05:49.433
- I can assure you.
- What if Mr. Wilson rings back?

01:05:49.435 --> 01:05:51.436
No one queries
Sir Harry's orders.

01:05:51.438 --> 01:05:52.704
But if he did?

01:05:52.706 --> 01:05:54.706
Well, then they'd
uncover the trick.

01:05:54.708 --> 01:05:57.275
But they couldn't
trace it back to me.

01:05:57.277 --> 01:05:59.376
Right. Shall we go into York?

01:05:59.378 --> 01:06:01.679
Sorry to miss out
on the fun, in a way.

01:06:01.681 --> 01:06:04.549
Where shall I wait for you
when you're with your parents?

01:06:04.551 --> 01:06:06.186
We'll find a pub.

01:06:11.991 --> 01:06:14.692
Did you manage
to speak to someone?

01:06:14.694 --> 01:06:17.328
I got hold
of Madame Seymour's assistant.

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:18.895
They've sent you the wrong one.

01:06:18.897 --> 01:06:21.666
It's similar in style
but not, as you can see,

01:06:21.668 --> 01:06:24.501
- in size.
- Well, where's my dress now?

01:06:24.503 --> 01:06:25.940
On its way to New York.

01:06:27.273 --> 01:06:28.405
Well, that's that, then.

01:06:28.407 --> 01:06:30.275
Wonderful.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:31.976
Everything's going wrong
for me today.

01:06:31.978 --> 01:06:35.313
- Milady?
- Oh. Never mind.

01:06:35.315 --> 01:06:38.349
How are things downstairs?
Any better?

01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:40.684
A bit better, yes, milady.

01:06:40.686 --> 01:06:43.288
In fact,
I ought to be getting back.

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:44.558
Of course.

01:06:46.893 --> 01:06:48.759
Oh, one thing.

01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:51.895
The painted glass
that used to sit by my bed,

01:06:51.897 --> 01:06:53.900
was it broken while I was away?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.567
Leave it with me, milady.

01:06:57.569 --> 01:06:59.436
And the dress.

01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:02.639
You wouldn't mind a fitting
later tonight, would you?

01:07:02.641 --> 01:07:04.741
I don't understand.
Who with?

01:07:04.743 --> 01:07:07.547
I just had an idea.

01:07:10.784 --> 01:07:11.983
I shouldn't think so,

01:07:11.985 --> 01:07:13.817
not if she knows
what's good for her.

01:07:13.819 --> 01:07:15.453
Oh, I...

01:07:15.455 --> 01:07:17.822
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:07:17.824 --> 01:07:20.657
How clever of you to find me.

01:07:20.659 --> 01:07:23.661
Well, not really.
I lived here 40 years.

01:07:23.663 --> 01:07:25.596
I assume this is your maid?

01:07:25.598 --> 01:07:28.699
- Yes, this is Lucy Smith.
- Oh.

01:07:28.701 --> 01:07:30.400
Good evening, Smith.

01:07:30.402 --> 01:07:32.603
Good evening, milady.

01:07:32.605 --> 01:07:35.038
- Shall I go?
- No, not for me.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.875
Not for me.
I'm delighted to meet you.

01:07:37.877 --> 01:07:40.610
I've heard so much about you.

01:07:40.612 --> 01:07:42.579
Is there something you want?

01:07:42.581 --> 01:07:43.915
Hmm?

01:07:43.917 --> 01:07:46.083
Oh, just-just to see
you're comfortable

01:07:46.085 --> 01:07:48.985
and to confirm
our little chat for later.

01:07:48.987 --> 01:07:50.788
I live my own life now, Violet.

01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:52.590
I'm not what I was.

01:07:52.592 --> 01:07:54.592
My father is gone.
My husband is gone.

01:07:54.594 --> 01:07:56.793
I see no reason
not to do what I want.

01:07:56.795 --> 01:07:59.630
Well, that doesn't mean
there is no reason,

01:07:59.632 --> 01:08:02.132
merely that you cannot see it.

01:08:02.134 --> 01:08:04.134
I think Lady Merton is right.

01:08:04.136 --> 01:08:07.105
We'll have it out,
once and for all.

01:08:07.107 --> 01:08:09.409
But now I must go
to Her Majesty.

01:08:14.413 --> 01:08:15.581
Hmm.

01:08:18.985 --> 01:08:21.385
You're not to speak.
You're not to think.

01:08:21.387 --> 01:08:23.054
Just follow my lead.

01:08:23.056 --> 01:08:26.157
Their Majesties must not know
they're being served

01:08:26.159 --> 01:08:27.891
by anyone different.
Do you hear me?

01:08:27.893 --> 01:08:29.894
I don't want them
to even notice.

01:08:29.896 --> 01:08:31.595
We will do our best, Mr. Wilson.

01:08:31.597 --> 01:08:32.796
I don't want your best.

01:08:32.798 --> 01:08:34.665
I want far better
than your best.

01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:37.435
Is everything under control
here, Mr. Wilson?

01:08:37.437 --> 01:08:39.636
I gather the others
caught the train.

01:08:39.638 --> 01:08:41.872
And this is
what we're left with.

01:08:41.874 --> 01:08:44.675
Mind you don't disgrace
the state livery, Albert.

01:08:44.677 --> 01:08:46.144
Of course, Mr. Carson.

01:08:46.146 --> 01:08:48.145
Where is Monsieur Courbet?

01:08:48.147 --> 01:08:50.848
- I came in here to see him.
- Uh, he went out.

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:53.917
So I thought I'd better get on
with dinner. Wasn't I right?

01:08:53.919 --> 01:08:56.753
- No, you were not right. You were entirely wrong!
- Oh!

01:08:58.958 --> 01:09:00.625
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:00.627 --> 01:09:03.629
I don't know h-how
that happened.

01:09:05.197 --> 01:09:08.468
Well, I shall
have to go and change.

01:09:09.768 --> 01:09:12.705
We'll sort this out
when I return.

01:09:22.449 --> 01:09:23.717
Andy.

01:09:29.088 --> 01:09:30.854
If you don't
want me to, I won't.

01:09:30.856 --> 01:09:32.155
But you've already said
that you will.

01:09:32.157 --> 01:09:34.458
Because it's a fantastic chance.

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.226
It didn't occur to me
you'd mind.

01:09:36.228 --> 01:09:38.662
I don't, exactly.
Not in that way.

01:09:38.664 --> 01:09:39.729
Then in what way?

01:09:39.731 --> 01:09:41.232
I wasn't going to tell you.

01:09:41.234 --> 01:09:44.668
I wasn't going
to tell anyone, but...

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:46.737
I might be pregnant.

01:09:48.674 --> 01:09:50.511
Oh, darling.

01:09:52.178 --> 01:09:54.511
How marvelous.

01:09:54.513 --> 01:09:56.247
How fabulous.

01:09:56.249 --> 01:09:58.216
My heart is bursting.

01:09:58.218 --> 01:10:00.016
Oh, well, that's
exactly what I don't want.

01:10:00.018 --> 01:10:02.519
- It could easily go wrong.
- Oh, but-but if it doesn't...

01:10:02.521 --> 01:10:04.020
Then I'll give birth

01:10:04.022 --> 01:10:07.093
just as you set off on
your three-month colonial tour.

01:10:09.829 --> 01:10:11.962
Why didn't you say this
when I first mentioned it?

01:10:11.964 --> 01:10:13.965
You'd agreed
before I had the chance.

01:10:13.967 --> 01:10:15.933
Secrets always muddle things.

01:10:15.935 --> 01:10:18.101
Oh, yes, that's right,
let's make it my fault.

01:10:18.103 --> 01:10:21.072
Well, I'll tell the king
I can't go.

01:10:21.074 --> 01:10:23.643
And he'll accept that, will he?

01:11:00.146 --> 01:11:02.712
Hello.
It's Miss Smith, isn't it?

01:11:02.714 --> 01:11:04.814
We were talking about you
earlier. Weren't we?

01:11:04.816 --> 01:11:06.817
Oh, Tom.

01:11:06.819 --> 01:11:10.820
What luck.
You know Miss Smith, don't you?

01:11:10.822 --> 01:11:12.959
Come along, Mary.

01:11:19.331 --> 01:11:20.797
Are you all right?

01:11:20.799 --> 01:11:22.233
Has something happened?

01:11:22.235 --> 01:11:25.302
Old Lady Grantham came in
while we were dressing.

01:11:25.304 --> 01:11:28.939
I think the stage is set
for a fight later, about me.

01:11:28.941 --> 01:11:31.207
She thinks Lady Bagshaw
means to favor me,

01:11:31.209 --> 01:11:34.045
- and she doesn't approve.
- What business is it of hers?

01:11:34.047 --> 01:11:35.813
Lady Bagshaw
must have her reasons,

01:11:35.815 --> 01:11:37.848
and that's good enough for me.

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:40.117
Going down, Tom?

01:11:40.119 --> 01:11:42.054
Good night.

01:11:47.727 --> 01:11:50.027
Ah, there you are, Miss Lawton.

01:11:50.029 --> 01:11:51.729
I hope you're having
a well-earned rest.

01:11:51.731 --> 01:11:53.296
Well, there's
always less for me to do

01:11:53.298 --> 01:11:55.065
when Miss Aplin arrives.

01:11:55.067 --> 01:11:57.368
But we must be ready
for the ball tomorrow.

01:11:57.370 --> 01:11:59.302
That's what I want
to talk about.

01:11:59.304 --> 01:12:02.640
Later this evening, when I
go up to help Lady Hexham,

01:12:02.642 --> 01:12:04.241
I want you to come with me,

01:12:04.243 --> 01:12:06.810
fit a new ball dress
and sew it overnight

01:12:06.812 --> 01:12:08.778
so it's done before you leave
in the morning.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:10.915
Why on earth would I do that?

01:12:10.917 --> 01:12:13.984
The box and cupid
from the drawing room.

01:12:13.986 --> 01:12:16.220
The library paper knife.

01:12:16.222 --> 01:12:18.926
Lady Hexham's painted glass.

01:12:20.192 --> 01:12:22.827
Never took the glass.

01:12:22.829 --> 01:12:25.895
Then it must have been broken,
like she said.

01:12:25.897 --> 01:12:28.265
But you took something
from that room.

01:12:28.267 --> 01:12:30.301
What was it?

01:12:30.303 --> 01:12:33.837
A patch box
from the dressing table.

01:12:33.839 --> 01:12:35.973
I'd like them all back, please.

01:12:35.975 --> 01:12:38.376
I can't sew a dress in a night.

01:12:38.378 --> 01:12:40.077
When would I sleep?

01:12:40.079 --> 01:12:41.979
When you get to Harewood
tomorrow.

01:12:41.981 --> 01:12:43.913
And don't think I won't tell.

01:12:43.915 --> 01:12:46.917
"Queen's dresser a thief."

01:12:46.919 --> 01:12:49.823
That'll make headlines
from here to Peru.

01:13:02.101 --> 01:13:05.202
The Marquess
and Marchioness of Granby.

01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:13.146
Sir William and Lady Ingleby.

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:19.949
Where are the royal footmen?

01:13:19.951 --> 01:13:21.952
They've had to go back
to London.

01:13:21.954 --> 01:13:25.055
All of them?
Wasn't that rather unlucky?

01:13:25.057 --> 01:13:27.792
Unlucky for some, milady.

01:13:27.794 --> 01:13:31.228
The Earl and Countess
of Scarborough.

01:13:36.468 --> 01:13:37.737
Ah.

01:13:42.441 --> 01:13:45.341
For goodness' sake!

01:13:45.343 --> 01:13:48.345
Help me!

01:13:48.347 --> 01:13:50.917
Will someone help me?

01:14:05.364 --> 01:14:08.299
I'm going on to Turton's
in a minute.

01:14:08.301 --> 01:14:09.934
Do you know it?

01:14:09.936 --> 01:14:11.438
Uh...

01:14:16.142 --> 01:14:18.309
I'm Chris Webster, by the way.

01:14:18.311 --> 01:14:20.911
I'm waiting for someone.

01:14:20.913 --> 01:14:22.912
For a very long time.

01:14:22.914 --> 01:14:24.685
Perhaps he's found
better things to do.

01:14:25.951 --> 01:14:27.353
And?

01:14:28.987 --> 01:14:31.287
Why don't you come with me?

01:14:31.289 --> 01:14:33.325
You know you want to.

01:14:39.298 --> 01:14:41.966
Excuse me, sir.
My name's Barrow.

01:14:41.968 --> 01:14:45.301
If someone comes looking for me,
could you tell him I've gone?

01:14:45.303 --> 01:14:48.107
- Shall I say where to?
- Never mind that. - Turton's.

01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:54.878
I just cannot understand
where Mr. Wilson has got to.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.947
Never mind him.
What about you?

01:14:56.949 --> 01:14:59.984
Surely, you can't really mean
to leave His Majesty unattended.

01:14:59.986 --> 01:15:02.051
But is it for me to attend him?

01:15:02.053 --> 01:15:03.520
Well, you've got
your breeches on.

01:15:03.522 --> 01:15:05.288
- Well, I have, but...
- Mr. Carson,

01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:07.158
this is your destiny.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.926
You know as much, and so do I.

01:15:09.928 --> 01:15:12.028
Now, accept it proudly.

01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:15.966
And walk into that room
with your head held high.

01:15:15.968 --> 01:15:17.204
You can do it, Mr. Carson.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.207
Please tell me what is going on.

01:15:24.209 --> 01:15:26.310
Mr. Courbet is missing,
ditto Mr. Wilson,

01:15:26.312 --> 01:15:29.113
and your footmen are
on their way up to London.

01:15:29.115 --> 01:15:30.915
I am still in charge here.

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:33.050
No, Mrs. Webb.
These are my people now.

01:15:33.052 --> 01:15:36.386
So please, uh, go back to the
servants' hall and sit down.

01:15:36.388 --> 01:15:38.257
Or would you rather
ruin the evening?

01:15:40.593 --> 01:15:42.292
That's telling her.

01:15:44.463 --> 01:15:46.430
Mrs. Patmore forgot
to send up the sauce.

01:15:46.432 --> 01:15:48.332
- And I've got the chopped egg.
- Oh, that's kind

01:15:48.334 --> 01:15:50.134
- when it's not your job.
- Nonsense.

01:15:50.136 --> 01:15:53.069
We must all pull our weight
tonight for Downton's glory.

01:15:53.071 --> 01:15:55.072
Now, are you ready, boys?

01:15:55.074 --> 01:15:56.306
Ready as we'll ever be.

01:15:56.308 --> 01:15:57.440
We'll be fine, Mrs. Hughes.

01:15:57.442 --> 01:15:59.109
What about you, Mr. Molesley?

01:15:59.111 --> 01:16:00.845
I know I'm
gonna forget my lines.

01:16:00.847 --> 01:16:02.313
You haven't got any lines.

01:16:02.315 --> 01:16:03.850
- You're on.
- Oh. Right.

01:16:05.383 --> 01:16:07.885
And, Mr. Molesley?

01:16:07.887 --> 01:16:09.485
Remember to breathe.

01:16:09.487 --> 01:16:11.287
Breathe, yeah.

01:16:11.289 --> 01:16:13.023
Gentlemen.

01:16:43.422 --> 01:16:45.288
I'm glad you're here,
Mr. Carson.

01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:47.828
I must go
where my king needs me.

01:16:56.268 --> 01:16:58.269
- Hello.
- All right.

01:17:07.612 --> 01:17:09.113
Oh, hello.

01:17:13.218 --> 01:17:15.219
Looks like we've got
some new blood here.

01:17:15.221 --> 01:17:17.020
Hello.

01:17:17.022 --> 01:17:19.592
You're a very charming
young man.

01:17:20.692 --> 01:17:22.158
Hey!

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.561
Stay with me!
Stay with me, Michael!

01:17:25.563 --> 01:17:27.965
I can't believe this.

01:17:27.967 --> 01:17:30.266
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:17:30.268 --> 01:17:32.202
There's a first time
for everything.

01:17:32.204 --> 01:17:33.970
I know, but...

01:17:33.972 --> 01:17:37.076
Here. Come dance with me.

01:17:42.514 --> 01:17:44.415
- What'd you say?
- I said, "There's your friend."

01:17:44.417 --> 01:17:45.683
No, my friend's over there.

01:17:48.553 --> 01:17:52.155
I wish I could tell them how
grateful they should be to you.

01:17:52.157 --> 01:17:54.358
You were every bit as brave
as I was.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.993
Mary,

01:17:55.995 --> 01:17:57.964
you're talking
in the wrong direction.

01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:01.532
Don't worry about Granny.

01:18:01.534 --> 01:18:04.400
She's getting ready
to give Cousin Maud a grilling.

01:18:04.402 --> 01:18:07.104
Mainly, I suspect,
about her maid.

01:18:07.106 --> 01:18:10.274
I think Lady Bagshaw sees her
as more than just her maid.

01:18:10.276 --> 01:18:12.076
Oh, I'm sure she does.

01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:14.411
And that's what
Granny's afraid of.

01:18:14.413 --> 01:18:16.313
I might as well admit...

01:18:16.315 --> 01:18:18.015
I like her.

01:18:18.017 --> 01:18:19.550
Good.

01:18:19.552 --> 01:18:22.353
Don't let them put you off.

01:18:22.355 --> 01:18:24.121
Tom, you're looking
pleased with yourself.

01:18:24.123 --> 01:18:25.689
He was just praising

01:18:25.691 --> 01:18:26.890
Lady Bagshaw's maid.

01:18:26.892 --> 01:18:32.028
Well, uh, how did she contrive
to make your acquaintance?

01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:34.230
She didn't contrive anything.
We met by chance.

01:18:34.232 --> 01:18:37.100
What simpletons men are.

01:18:37.102 --> 01:18:38.568
This is good.

01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:40.738
And I thought
something else was planned.

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.338
But it is excellent.

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.742
So, a well-done to old Courbet.

01:18:44.744 --> 01:18:46.577
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, very delicious.

01:18:46.579 --> 01:18:48.311
This wasn't Monsieur Courbet,
Your Majesty.

01:18:48.313 --> 01:18:49.613
Mrs. Patmore cooked it.

01:18:49.615 --> 01:18:52.149
In fact, it is
the Downton Abbey staff

01:18:52.151 --> 01:18:53.520
who are serving you
this evening.

01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:03.696
Oh.

01:19:07.432 --> 01:19:09.535
Oh.

01:19:11.102 --> 01:19:13.537
I do beg your pardon,
Your Majesty.

01:19:13.539 --> 01:19:16.109
That's quite enough, Molesley.

01:19:17.543 --> 01:19:20.176
You must give our compliments
to Mrs. Patmore

01:19:20.178 --> 01:19:22.512
and all the staff.

01:19:22.514 --> 01:19:24.515
- Molesley.
- Huh?

01:19:24.517 --> 01:19:27.620
Her Majesty is speaking to you.

01:19:31.156 --> 01:19:34.727
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

01:19:49.107 --> 01:19:50.607
That was kind of you, ma'am.

01:19:50.609 --> 01:19:52.676
I suppose he's excited

01:19:52.678 --> 01:19:55.144
that they've had to take over
from our people.

01:19:55.146 --> 01:19:56.747
I wonder what's happened.

01:19:56.749 --> 01:19:59.683
Whatever may have happened
does not excuse his behavior.

01:19:59.685 --> 01:20:01.518
I can assure you,
Lady Grantham,

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.753
we are quite used
to people behaving strangely

01:20:03.755 --> 01:20:05.189
when we are near.

01:20:20.772 --> 01:20:23.308
- Whoa!
- That's it. I've got you.

01:20:29.315 --> 01:20:31.280
The peelers are here!

01:20:31.282 --> 01:20:33.250
It's the police!

01:20:33.252 --> 01:20:35.284
Make sure no one
scarpers. Block all the exits.

01:20:35.286 --> 01:20:36.752
- What's going on?
- All right, gentlemen,

01:20:36.754 --> 01:20:39.723
that's the end of your evening.
Shut that music up now!

01:20:39.725 --> 01:20:41.425
Right!

01:20:41.427 --> 01:20:43.726
You are all coming
to the station with us.

01:20:45.364 --> 01:20:47.163
We're just having a bit of fun,
Officer.

01:20:47.165 --> 01:20:48.465
No one's making any trouble.

01:20:48.467 --> 01:20:49.699
That's for the judge to decide.

01:20:49.701 --> 01:20:50.734
- Judge?
- What did you think?

01:20:50.736 --> 01:20:52.735
We're gonna slap your wrists
and send you home?

01:20:52.737 --> 01:20:54.304
I've never been here before.

01:20:54.306 --> 01:20:55.538
You're here now. Right!

01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:56.907
Gather your things!

01:20:56.909 --> 01:21:00.409
You're coming with us,
you dirty perverts. Out.

01:21:00.411 --> 01:21:02.613
- Get out! Move it!
- Come on, you filthy sods.

01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:10.820
- Come on, you lot.
- Pack it in. Get in the van.

01:21:10.822 --> 01:21:13.293
Sort it out.

01:21:31.744 --> 01:21:33.476
- There we are, my dear.
- Oh, thank you.

01:21:33.478 --> 01:21:35.179
Yes, darling.

01:21:35.181 --> 01:21:36.479
Thank you.

01:21:38.584 --> 01:21:40.520
There might be a moment.

01:21:42.353 --> 01:21:44.287
I met the maid.

01:21:44.289 --> 01:21:46.523
She has Maud wound
around her little finger.

01:21:46.525 --> 01:21:48.625
- Then we need to know why.
- Mm.

01:21:48.627 --> 01:21:50.793
Well, I'll
look forward to it, gentlemen.

01:21:50.795 --> 01:21:53.729
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Milord.

01:21:53.731 --> 01:21:55.565
What is it, Hexham?

01:21:55.567 --> 01:21:57.533
Well, Your Majesty, it's this.

01:21:57.535 --> 01:21:59.769
I've just learned
that Lady Hexham

01:21:59.771 --> 01:22:02.206
is expecting our first child.

01:22:02.208 --> 01:22:03.774
But that's wonderful news.

01:22:03.776 --> 01:22:05.576
We're not telling anyone
quite yet,

01:22:05.578 --> 01:22:07.510
but I thought
you'd be interested.

01:22:07.512 --> 01:22:10.449
And so I am. Congratulations.

01:22:11.517 --> 01:22:13.583
The-the thing is, sir,

01:22:13.585 --> 01:22:15.418
it's due to be born
around the time

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.688
the prince and I
will be setting off on tour.

01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:18.921
Excellent.

01:22:18.923 --> 01:22:21.390
Please make it register
with him.

01:22:21.392 --> 01:22:23.760
Help the prince
to understand what it means

01:22:23.762 --> 01:22:25.429
to have a real family life.

01:22:25.431 --> 01:22:27.463
You can be such an example
to him.

01:22:27.465 --> 01:22:29.466
I know it.

01:22:29.468 --> 01:22:33.269
Very well.
Let's get to the point.

01:22:33.271 --> 01:22:37.006
Robert is my nearest relation
on my father's side.

01:22:37.008 --> 01:22:39.275
He is.

01:22:39.277 --> 01:22:40.943
But he will not be my heir.

01:22:40.945 --> 01:22:44.280
And there we have it.

01:22:44.282 --> 01:22:45.849
Who will be? Can you tell us?

01:22:45.851 --> 01:22:48.585
Lucy Smith, my maid.

01:22:48.587 --> 01:22:51.354
What? Are you out of your mind?

01:22:51.356 --> 01:22:53.489
No. And I know what I'm doing.

01:22:53.491 --> 01:22:55.725
On the contrary,
you're-you're clearly insane.

01:22:55.727 --> 01:22:57.493
You should be in an asylum.

01:22:57.495 --> 01:22:59.262
How like you.
A word of resistance,

01:22:59.264 --> 01:23:01.465
and you slash with your saber.

01:23:01.467 --> 01:23:04.967
It is lucky for Miss Smith
that I do not own a saber.

01:23:04.969 --> 01:23:07.570
So, this is truly your choice?

01:23:07.572 --> 01:23:09.872
Lucy has taken care of me
for many years.

01:23:09.874 --> 01:23:12.042
I wish to show my gratitude.

01:23:12.044 --> 01:23:14.043
With the family house?

01:23:14.045 --> 01:23:15.811
With the family estate?

01:23:15.813 --> 01:23:17.648
You belong in a straitjacket.

01:23:17.650 --> 01:23:21.685
To treat your maid
as a blood relation

01:23:21.687 --> 01:23:25.021
is to unpick every fiber
of the English way of life.

01:23:25.023 --> 01:23:26.422
What piffle you talk.

01:23:26.424 --> 01:23:29.626
- Oh!
- Please, there is no need to argue.

01:23:29.628 --> 01:23:30.793
I never argue.

01:23:30.795 --> 01:23:32.528
I explain.

01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:34.665
Face it, Violet,
I'll outlive you anyway,

01:23:34.667 --> 01:23:36.300
so it need trouble you
no further.

01:23:36.302 --> 01:23:39.706
And now...
I must attend Her Majesty.

01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:47.610
Game, set and match
to Lady Bagshaw.

01:23:47.612 --> 01:23:49.813
Not while I'm the umpire.

01:23:53.785 --> 01:23:55.786
We had a few drinks,
and Mr. Barrow thought

01:23:55.788 --> 01:23:59.389
it'd be fun to play a trick
on the queers, that's all.

01:23:59.391 --> 01:24:00.991
He was only in there
for five minutes.

01:24:00.993 --> 01:24:04.528
Dancing the tango
with another man.

01:24:04.530 --> 01:24:06.898
Come on, Sergeant,
it was a joke.

01:24:09.634 --> 01:24:11.435
Turns your stomach, though.

01:24:11.437 --> 01:24:13.502
- Relieved to hear it.
- Yeah, I'd rather be dead

01:24:13.504 --> 01:24:15.307
if I thought I was one of them.

01:24:18.343 --> 01:24:20.379
But what can I say to the earl?

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.380
What earl?

01:24:23.382 --> 01:24:25.015
The Earl of Grantham.

01:24:25.017 --> 01:24:26.550
Mr. Barrow is his butler.

01:24:26.552 --> 01:24:28.085
Of course,
you'll want to see proof

01:24:28.087 --> 01:24:29.522
of my identity.

01:24:54.512 --> 01:24:57.046
- Was it you who got me out?
- No.

01:24:57.048 --> 01:24:59.051
The good fairy came down
on a moonbeam.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.119
How did you know where I'd gone?

01:25:03.121 --> 01:25:05.122
The landlord told me.

01:25:05.124 --> 01:25:07.123
Waited outside,
followed you here.

01:25:07.125 --> 01:25:09.559
Then I showed the sergeant
my card,

01:25:09.561 --> 01:25:11.731
and that seemed
to settle things.

01:25:14.967 --> 01:25:16.966
"The royal household."

01:25:16.968 --> 01:25:18.904
He must have loved that.

01:25:22.407 --> 01:25:23.739
I'm a...

01:25:23.741 --> 01:25:25.677
I'm afraid
I've been a silly boy.

01:25:27.445 --> 01:25:29.445
You just need to be
a bit more circumspect

01:25:29.447 --> 01:25:31.415
in future, Mr. Barrow.

01:25:45.798 --> 01:25:47.564
Could you please remove it,
milady,

01:25:47.566 --> 01:25:49.565
leaving the pins in place?

01:25:49.567 --> 01:25:52.568
Can you really get it done
before you go?

01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:55.037
- I don't see how.
- She'll finish it.

01:25:55.039 --> 01:25:57.774
- Won't you?
- I'll do my best.

01:25:57.776 --> 01:25:59.975
I'm sure you'll manage.

01:25:59.977 --> 01:26:02.778
By the way, I think I know
what happened to the cupid

01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:04.613
from the drawing room, milady.

01:26:04.615 --> 01:26:06.649
Really? Was it missing?

01:26:06.651 --> 01:26:09.586
Your dress will be ready
in the morning, milady.

01:26:09.588 --> 01:26:10.556
Thank you.

01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:16.158
I don't know how
you persuaded her.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.993
She's nice, really.
When you get to know her.

01:26:19.464 --> 01:26:21.030
Is there anything else?

01:26:21.032 --> 01:26:22.899
Only to say
that you're a genius.

01:26:22.901 --> 01:26:25.805
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:26:33.512 --> 01:26:35.581
I'm afraid
I didn't get anywhere.

01:26:36.682 --> 01:26:38.614
Well, that's that.

01:26:38.616 --> 01:26:40.516
Just because the king
doesn't see that a man

01:26:40.518 --> 01:26:41.885
has any part to play
in childbearing.

01:26:41.887 --> 01:26:43.720
Well, he doesn't.

01:26:43.722 --> 01:26:46.021
But you'd think he'd know
that one likes to be around.

01:26:46.023 --> 01:26:47.858
You can't just tell him no?

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:50.627
Darling, I'm one of
the senior peers in the land.

01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:52.061
What do you think that means?

01:26:52.063 --> 01:26:54.163
What do you think I'm sworn to?

01:27:02.708 --> 01:27:04.908
Lady Bagshaw,
could I have a word

01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:06.846
before you ring for your maid?

01:27:08.914 --> 01:27:12.151
Does Lucy know
that you're her mother?

01:27:14.253 --> 01:27:16.252
She does.

01:27:16.254 --> 01:27:18.555
For years,
I said I was her godmother,

01:27:18.557 --> 01:27:20.857
but I told her the truth
on her 18th birthday.

01:27:20.859 --> 01:27:23.693
How old was she when Jack died?

01:27:23.695 --> 01:27:25.929
Six.

01:27:25.931 --> 01:27:29.198
She'd lived with Jack
and his mother until then.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.800
But I took her into the house,

01:27:30.802 --> 01:27:32.167
and she went
to the village school

01:27:32.169 --> 01:27:34.537
until, eventually,
she became my maid.

01:27:34.539 --> 01:27:36.238
I suppose
if she'd been your ward,

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.841
people would have guessed.

01:27:37.843 --> 01:27:39.208
Exactly.

01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:41.077
Who takes notice of a servant?

01:27:41.079 --> 01:27:42.982
I hid her in plain sight.

01:27:44.115 --> 01:27:45.917
Did you love Jack Smith?

01:27:49.021 --> 01:27:52.588
Everyone should know
a total love at least once.

01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:55.026
Jack was mine.

01:27:58.129 --> 01:28:01.564
My husband was very dull,
you know?

01:28:01.566 --> 01:28:03.600
He wasn't a bad man, but...

01:28:03.602 --> 01:28:06.670
but he wasn't a clever one,
either.

01:28:06.672 --> 01:28:09.905
Then he died,
and Jack came to see me,

01:28:09.907 --> 01:28:11.774
and it began from there.

01:28:11.776 --> 01:28:13.877
How daring.

01:28:13.879 --> 01:28:15.744
I know it sounds reckless,

01:28:15.746 --> 01:28:17.948
but I was 39
when I got pregnant.

01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:20.750
I thought I was barren.

01:28:20.752 --> 01:28:24.787
Of course, I knew I couldn't
tell my father, so...

01:28:24.789 --> 01:28:26.756
I went to America.

01:28:26.758 --> 01:28:28.658
They must have
thought that wild.

01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:32.628
Well, little did they know
how wild it really was.

01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:34.764
But you were happy with Jack?

01:28:34.766 --> 01:28:38.033
Oh, very.

01:28:38.035 --> 01:28:40.806
We had ten years together
before he died.

01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:46.242
I'd have married him
if I'd had the courage.

01:28:46.244 --> 01:28:48.345
I was weak.

01:28:48.347 --> 01:28:50.913
But you never knew my father.

01:28:50.915 --> 01:28:53.750
I suppose royal service
kept you silent on the subject.

01:28:53.752 --> 01:28:54.984
Yes.

01:28:54.986 --> 01:28:57.886
In a way.

01:28:57.888 --> 01:29:00.092
But it was cowardice, really.

01:29:01.826 --> 01:29:04.193
Now, by making Lucy my heir,

01:29:04.195 --> 01:29:06.965
I will have taken
the first step.

01:29:08.667 --> 01:29:10.667
You must tell Violet at once.

01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:12.668
- I couldn't.
- You're wrong.

01:29:12.670 --> 01:29:15.037
As soon as she knows the truth,
she'll fathom your plans

01:29:15.039 --> 01:29:17.774
and cease to fight you.

01:29:17.776 --> 01:29:20.976
The servants seem to be
enjoying themselves tonight.

01:29:20.978 --> 01:29:23.048
Especially Molesley.

01:29:24.782 --> 01:29:27.016
What happened to the royal team?

01:29:27.018 --> 01:29:29.118
It's a long story, milady.

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.988
But you're right.
We did have fun.

01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:35.125
Well, I'm glad it's gone well
for everyone.

01:29:35.127 --> 01:29:37.661
But I don't think
I could face doing it again.

01:29:37.663 --> 01:29:39.662
You're not finished yet.

01:29:39.664 --> 01:29:41.197
You've still got the ball
at Harewood.

01:29:41.199 --> 01:29:43.667
Yes, but it won't be our fault
if anything goes wrong.

01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:45.668
That's not very cheerful.

01:29:45.670 --> 01:29:48.671
The last few days
have made me think.

01:29:48.673 --> 01:29:50.806
Should we really go on with it?

01:29:50.808 --> 01:29:53.275
We're running the house
with too few people as it is,

01:29:53.277 --> 01:29:56.145
and half of those here now
will leave soon.

01:29:56.147 --> 01:29:58.047
What are you saying, milady?

01:29:58.049 --> 01:30:00.917
Isn't it time
to chuck in the towel?

01:30:00.919 --> 01:30:03.155
Lots of people have.

01:30:04.755 --> 01:30:07.323
You mean... leave Downton?

01:30:07.325 --> 01:30:09.926
We could sell it for a school

01:30:09.928 --> 01:30:12.729
or an old people's home
or something.

01:30:12.731 --> 01:30:15.732
And buy a manor house
with a modest estate

01:30:15.734 --> 01:30:17.332
and live a normal life.

01:30:17.334 --> 01:30:19.638
Is that what you want?

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:25.408
I want everything
to stop being such a struggle.

01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:29.045
Will the staff stay?
Will the farms pay?

01:30:29.047 --> 01:30:30.982
What are we going to do
about the roof?

01:30:32.417 --> 01:30:34.451
When I was putting up
the chairs in the rain,

01:30:34.453 --> 01:30:37.453
I kept thinking,
"What am I doing?"

01:30:37.455 --> 01:30:39.456
I'll tell you
what you're doing, milady.

01:30:39.458 --> 01:30:42.759
You're making a center
for the people who work here.

01:30:42.761 --> 01:30:44.426
For this village.

01:30:44.428 --> 01:30:46.162
For the county.

01:30:46.164 --> 01:30:48.965
Downton Abbey is the heart
of this community,

01:30:48.967 --> 01:30:51.904
and you're keeping it beating.

01:30:53.271 --> 01:30:55.270
So you think
we should battle on?

01:30:55.272 --> 01:30:59.208
- While there's blood in your veins.
- Hmm.

01:31:10.387 --> 01:31:12.122
Ah, Miss Smith.

01:31:12.124 --> 01:31:13.790
Is she settled for the night?

01:31:13.792 --> 01:31:15.925
She's more rattled than settled.

01:31:15.927 --> 01:31:17.460
And I was right.

01:31:17.462 --> 01:31:20.395
There was an argument.
It was about me.

01:31:20.397 --> 01:31:22.030
I hear from Lord Grantham
she's planning

01:31:22.032 --> 01:31:23.766
to alter your life
for the better.

01:31:23.768 --> 01:31:25.769
He says Old Lady Grantham
was up in arms.

01:31:25.771 --> 01:31:28.104
I can imagine.

01:31:28.106 --> 01:31:31.073
Are you entitled
to your good luck?

01:31:31.075 --> 01:31:33.275
Do you know why she's doing it?

01:31:33.277 --> 01:31:35.177
I do.

01:31:35.179 --> 01:31:37.180
And I think it's fair.

01:31:37.182 --> 01:31:40.486
Go forward in health,
and use your luck wisely.

01:31:42.788 --> 01:31:44.921
I have such a feeling
that you can understand

01:31:44.923 --> 01:31:48.224
what's going on inside my head
when no one else does

01:31:48.226 --> 01:31:49.962
or ever could.

01:31:53.964 --> 01:31:55.965
I'll miss our talks.

01:31:55.967 --> 01:31:58.268
Would you like to write to me?

01:31:58.270 --> 01:32:00.470
I could always provide
a shoulder.

01:32:00.472 --> 01:32:02.037
May I?

01:32:02.039 --> 01:32:03.341
Really?

01:32:07.478 --> 01:32:10.512
I should be pleased
and flattered if you would.

01:32:28.365 --> 01:32:32.001
And now I think it's time
to say good night, Mr. Branson.

01:32:32.003 --> 01:32:34.503
Good night, Miss Smith.

01:32:44.481 --> 01:32:46.282
Here's to the triumph of Downton

01:32:46.284 --> 01:32:48.016
and my beautiful wife.

01:32:48.018 --> 01:32:50.452
Oh, here's to all of you
who brought it off.

01:32:50.454 --> 01:32:52.988
Here's to Mr. Carson
for swallowing his principles.

01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:54.890
Well, I shan't
sleep a wink tonight.

01:32:54.892 --> 01:32:56.259
And here's to Her Majesty

01:32:56.261 --> 01:32:58.094
for taking pity on Mr. Molesley.

01:32:58.096 --> 01:33:00.630
For a moment there, I thought
I was headed for the Tower.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:04.033
You're not coming round to 'em,
are you?

01:33:04.035 --> 01:33:06.034
Uh, it was decent of her, Daisy,

01:33:06.036 --> 01:33:07.202
when she could have let it
spoil things.

01:33:07.204 --> 01:33:09.204
Not everyone's like Robespierre.

01:33:09.206 --> 01:33:12.007
Let's hear it
for the king and queen.

01:33:12.009 --> 01:33:14.176
The king and queen.

01:33:14.178 --> 01:33:17.079
I've got to tell you
something, Daisy.

01:33:20.084 --> 01:33:22.185
It was me that broke the pump.

01:33:22.187 --> 01:33:24.119
I don't know what I was doing.

01:33:24.121 --> 01:33:25.988
I was just in a jealous rage.

01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:28.323
- Why?
- It was that plumber you made eyes at.

01:33:28.325 --> 01:33:29.893
I just saw red.

01:33:29.895 --> 01:33:31.260
And then when I realized
I'd brought him

01:33:31.262 --> 01:33:32.895
back to the house,
I went nearly mad.

01:33:32.897 --> 01:33:34.463
I did not make eyes.

01:33:34.465 --> 01:33:37.332
I liked him, but there was
nothing more to it.

01:33:37.334 --> 01:33:40.103
Well, I feel a fool now.

01:33:40.105 --> 01:33:43.506
You tried to wreck the visit
of the King of England.

01:33:43.508 --> 01:33:45.207
You risked being sacked,

01:33:45.209 --> 01:33:46.676
you risked ruin...

01:33:46.678 --> 01:33:48.211
...just for the love of me?

01:33:48.213 --> 01:33:50.512
I just...
my feelings took over.

01:33:50.514 --> 01:33:52.515
That's all I can say.

01:33:52.517 --> 01:33:54.016
Can you forgive me?

01:33:54.018 --> 01:33:56.185
Forgive you?

01:33:56.187 --> 01:33:59.255
Oh, Andy, I'd have done it
myself if I'd had the nerve.

01:33:59.257 --> 01:34:02.391
Don't you see what it means?

01:34:02.393 --> 01:34:04.394
We're alike, you and I.

01:34:04.396 --> 01:34:06.930
Full of passion
for what matters.

01:34:06.932 --> 01:34:08.997
I thought
you were easily satisfied,

01:34:08.999 --> 01:34:11.033
but I see now you're not.

01:34:11.035 --> 01:34:14.237
So we can fight our way
to a better world together.

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.306
I'm not sure I've shown

01:34:17.308 --> 01:34:18.975
enough gratitude
for what you did.

01:34:18.977 --> 01:34:20.976
We have to stick
together, men like us.

01:34:20.978 --> 01:34:22.144
That's the point.

01:34:22.146 --> 01:34:23.947
I don't know any men like I am.

01:34:23.949 --> 01:34:26.015
I've never just talked
to someone like me.

01:34:26.017 --> 01:34:27.183
Well, we're talking now.

01:34:27.185 --> 01:34:29.351
And it feels good.

01:34:29.353 --> 01:34:31.287
Just to be two blokes,
having a chat,

01:34:31.289 --> 01:34:33.189
not trying to fit in for once.

01:34:33.191 --> 01:34:36.591
Well, we all have to do
what we must to get by.

01:34:36.593 --> 01:34:39.597
But yeah. Feels good
to be two ordinary blokes.

01:34:41.098 --> 01:34:43.632
Will they ever see it our way?

01:34:43.634 --> 01:34:46.034
I don't know.

01:34:46.036 --> 01:34:48.641
50 years ago, who'd have
thought man could fly?

01:35:19.236 --> 01:35:21.172
Mrs. Bates?

01:35:22.673 --> 01:35:24.208
Well, here's the dress.

01:35:25.276 --> 01:35:26.775
We can try it before you leave.

01:35:26.777 --> 01:35:29.380
No need. It'll fit.

01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:34.987
Those are the things you wanted.

01:35:38.056 --> 01:35:40.355
Why do you do it, Miss Lawton?

01:35:40.357 --> 01:35:42.492
Doesn't it ever worry you

01:35:42.494 --> 01:35:44.193
that on each table
in this house,

01:35:44.195 --> 01:35:45.661
there's an ornament
that you couldn't buy

01:35:45.663 --> 01:35:46.762
with a year's wages?

01:35:46.764 --> 01:35:48.296
And what's your answer?

01:35:48.298 --> 01:35:49.564
Because everyone
can't have them,

01:35:49.566 --> 01:35:51.567
- no one should have them?
- No.

01:35:51.569 --> 01:35:54.436
My answer is,
"Why can't I have them?

01:35:54.438 --> 01:35:56.171
Or some of them."

01:35:56.173 --> 01:35:58.808
Don't worry,
they won't miss what I take.

01:35:58.810 --> 01:36:00.810
I doubt there's more
than one in 100

01:36:00.812 --> 01:36:02.244
would even notice they're gone.

01:36:02.246 --> 01:36:04.247
But they're not yours,
Miss Lawton.

01:36:04.249 --> 01:36:05.715
And they never will be.

01:36:05.717 --> 01:36:07.783
I'd give it up if I were you.

01:36:07.785 --> 01:36:10.653
What if people were to think
Her Majesty was light-fingered

01:36:10.655 --> 01:36:13.359
if things go missing
from every house she stays in?

01:36:15.259 --> 01:36:19.097
Keep your advice for someone
who's interested, Mrs. Bates.

01:36:20.731 --> 01:36:23.399
Those doors play up
something dreadful.

01:36:23.401 --> 01:36:25.301
They jam and stick
for no reason.

01:36:25.303 --> 01:36:26.536
It's happened to everyone.

01:36:26.538 --> 01:36:28.403
Why didn't any of you look
for me?

01:36:28.405 --> 01:36:30.439
I thought I'd seen you go out,
Mr. Wilson.

01:36:30.441 --> 01:36:32.442
I'm afraid I was mistaken.

01:36:32.444 --> 01:36:35.711
Just as you were mistaken
in not waking Monsieur Courbet.

01:36:35.713 --> 01:36:37.715
- We thought he'd gone out and all.
- Oh.

01:36:41.218 --> 01:36:42.618
Thank you, Mrs. Hughes.

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:45.087
Uh, a little more marmalade,
if you please.

01:36:46.691 --> 01:36:47.790
The footmen have
telephoned this morning.

01:36:47.792 --> 01:36:50.693
It seems it was a hoax
that took them up to London.

01:36:50.695 --> 01:36:53.395
- But who would do that?
- Who, indeed?

01:36:53.397 --> 01:36:56.265
We can investigate
when we get to Harewood.

01:36:56.267 --> 01:36:57.867
I should be careful,
Monsieur Courbet,

01:36:57.869 --> 01:37:00.103
unless you enjoy ridicule.

01:37:00.105 --> 01:37:03.271
- What?
- I'd say the dinner was a success.

01:37:03.273 --> 01:37:05.408
They sent down
their compliments,

01:37:05.410 --> 01:37:07.643
so I think it must have been.

01:37:07.645 --> 01:37:10.145
Well, then,
why call attention to it?

01:37:10.147 --> 01:37:13.515
Would you show to advantage
in this story, do you think?

01:37:13.517 --> 01:37:16.118
But what do we say
if we're asked?

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.886
There was a confusion in London.

01:37:17.888 --> 01:37:20.857
Monsieur Courbet was ill.

01:37:20.859 --> 01:37:23.493
If I were you,
I wouldn't mention it.

01:37:23.495 --> 01:37:25.293
Not unless they bring it up.

01:37:25.295 --> 01:37:27.162
Quite right.

01:37:32.169 --> 01:37:34.072
There you are.

01:37:35.572 --> 01:37:37.476
I've been looking everywhere.

01:37:40.311 --> 01:37:42.878
What's the matter, darling?

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:46.349
Is it something I can help with?

01:37:46.351 --> 01:37:49.484
Judging by last night,
I doubt it.

01:37:50.922 --> 01:37:53.689
I just want to own my own life.

01:37:53.691 --> 01:37:56.525
I want to say things that
I think and do what I like.

01:37:56.527 --> 01:37:58.528
- Don't you now?
- No.

01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:01.430
I spend my time entertaining
people who bore me to death

01:38:01.432 --> 01:38:03.698
because they're entitled
to sit at our table.

01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:06.335
I attend committees
that I haven't chosen

01:38:06.337 --> 01:38:08.738
because they've chosen me.

01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:12.308
I used to have a job
that I loved, but not anymore.

01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:14.743
And now my husband won't
be there when I have a baby.

01:38:14.745 --> 01:38:16.746
The woman in the lodge

01:38:16.748 --> 01:38:18.680
is entitled to that,
but I'm not.

01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:31.394
<i>Early warning.</i>

01:38:31.396 --> 01:38:33.229
Their Majesties
are getting ready to leave.

01:38:33.231 --> 01:38:34.829
Very good, milord.

01:38:39.971 --> 01:38:42.971
Darling, what's the matter?

01:38:42.973 --> 01:38:45.440
Nothing you can help with.

01:38:45.442 --> 01:38:47.178
Can't I try?

01:38:49.347 --> 01:38:50.880
Oh, uh, we should go up.

01:38:50.882 --> 01:38:52.480
Their Majesties
are on their way.

01:38:52.482 --> 01:38:54.684
Oh, right.

01:38:54.686 --> 01:38:56.418
Come on.

01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:57.655
Up we go.

01:39:01.726 --> 01:39:03.993
So, you're off to London?

01:39:03.995 --> 01:39:06.796
They'll drop me at the station.

01:39:06.798 --> 01:39:09.232
Well, I hope
we can keep in touch.

01:39:09.234 --> 01:39:11.335
I feel I've finally
found a friend.

01:39:12.603 --> 01:39:14.670
Is that what you found,
Mr. Barrow?

01:39:14.672 --> 01:39:15.871
A friend?

01:39:20.878 --> 01:39:23.514
- Their Majesties are going.
- Thanks.

01:39:27.017 --> 01:39:29.018
I want you to have this.

01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:31.586
It's not much,
but I've had it for years.

01:39:31.588 --> 01:39:34.023
It'll remind you of me.

01:39:34.025 --> 01:39:35.824
That's the point, isn't it?

01:39:35.826 --> 01:39:38.527
So you can think of me
till we meet again?

01:39:41.331 --> 01:39:43.235
Thank you.

01:39:44.334 --> 01:39:45.667
Mr. Ellis,

01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:48.507
you must come!

01:40:01.018 --> 01:40:03.918
I hope you enjoy your time
at Harewood, sir.

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.055
Yes. I hope so, too.

01:40:07.057 --> 01:40:08.457
It isn't really goodbye

01:40:08.459 --> 01:40:10.059
when we'll see you all
this evening.

01:40:10.061 --> 01:40:11.926
We're looking forward
to the ball.

01:40:11.928 --> 01:40:14.764
Harewood
is such a wonderful house.

01:40:14.766 --> 01:40:17.466
Well, let's mount up, shall we?

01:40:19.704 --> 01:40:22.738
- We'll see you later, Grantham.
- Your Majesty.

01:40:50.435 --> 01:40:52.801
Well done, everyone.
Shall we head back in?

01:40:55.572 --> 01:40:57.973
Mary, what are you
wearing to the ball?

01:40:57.975 --> 01:40:59.108
Oh, I don't know.

01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:02.644
Carson, what happened to
the royal servants last night?

01:41:02.646 --> 01:41:04.113
Hard to say, milord.

01:41:04.115 --> 01:41:06.716
They sort of gave up the ghost.

01:41:06.718 --> 01:41:09.452
Well, you managed splendidly.

01:41:09.454 --> 01:41:12.555
Although I could have done
without Molesley's aria.

01:41:12.557 --> 01:41:15.457
But please thank the staff
for saving the day.

01:41:18.463 --> 01:41:20.829
Oh, uh, Mrs. Bates?

01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:23.899
- Excuse me.
- Can I ask you something?

01:41:23.901 --> 01:41:26.635
What did you give
Monsieur Courbet?

01:41:26.637 --> 01:41:29.003
A double dose
of a sleeping draught

01:41:29.005 --> 01:41:31.976
from Mr. Bakewell's...
in his tea.

01:41:36.981 --> 01:41:40.616
I'm afraid I made rather a fool
of myself last night.

01:41:40.618 --> 01:41:43.786
You could never be a fool to me.

01:41:43.788 --> 01:41:45.653
Do you mean that, really?

01:41:45.655 --> 01:41:47.021
I do.

01:41:47.023 --> 01:41:49.660
And I think you know how much.

01:42:00.036 --> 01:42:01.936
You're right, Mrs. Patmore.

01:42:01.938 --> 01:42:04.774
It's time I started
to plan my wedding.

01:42:04.776 --> 01:42:06.775
Well, I don't know
what took you so long.

01:42:06.777 --> 01:42:09.778
I wasn't sure before,
but I am now.

01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:12.448
Well, that's good to hear.

01:42:12.450 --> 01:42:14.850
I'm happy, Mrs. Patmore.

01:42:14.852 --> 01:42:17.853
I don't often say that,
but I am.

01:42:25.695 --> 01:42:28.430
Are you very shocked by it all?

01:42:28.432 --> 01:42:31.033
I should be. Interfering
with the palace staff

01:42:31.035 --> 01:42:33.735
on a royal visit...
and me part of it, to boot.

01:42:33.737 --> 01:42:35.171
I don't know what came over me.

01:42:35.173 --> 01:42:37.473
But?

01:42:37.475 --> 01:42:39.140
They had it coming to them,
Elsie.

01:42:39.142 --> 01:42:42.010
Let's face it,
they had it coming in spades.

01:42:42.012 --> 01:42:43.778
Hello.

01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:45.747
What's this?

01:42:57.527 --> 01:42:59.194
Welcome back, Mr. Talbot.

01:42:59.196 --> 01:43:01.729
Hello, Carson. Mrs. Hughes.

01:43:01.731 --> 01:43:03.466
Do you know where
I'll find Lady Mary?

01:43:03.468 --> 01:43:05.033
After everything that's gone on,

01:43:05.035 --> 01:43:07.536
I should think
she'll be lying down, sir.

01:43:07.538 --> 01:43:09.537
They all will be.

01:43:09.539 --> 01:43:10.905
Sounds ominous.

01:43:14.145 --> 01:43:17.246
That's nice that he's back
in time for the ball.

01:43:17.248 --> 01:43:21.082
And thank the Lord
we don't have to organize it.

01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:38.067
Oh, darling, you don't know
what we've lived though.

01:43:38.069 --> 01:43:39.868
I'm sorry I couldn't
get here sooner.

01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:42.104
It was the first ship after
the last meeting, I promise.

01:43:42.106 --> 01:43:43.805
Oh, never mind.
You're here now.

01:43:43.807 --> 01:43:45.841
And I don't have to go
to the ball alone

01:43:45.843 --> 01:43:47.609
like a sad little wallflower.

01:43:47.611 --> 01:43:49.043
Well, I'll only come
if you promise

01:43:49.045 --> 01:43:52.046
- to dance with me nonstop.
- Oh, it's a deal.

01:44:08.298 --> 01:44:10.165
- Good evening.
- Your Majesty.

01:44:10.167 --> 01:44:12.167
I suppose Maud has brought

01:44:12.169 --> 01:44:14.569
that scheming little minx
with her.

01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:16.271
If you continue in this vein,

01:44:16.273 --> 01:44:18.006
you will only make yourself
look stupid.

01:44:18.008 --> 01:44:20.943
- What-what do you mean?
- What I say.

01:44:20.945 --> 01:44:22.845
Are you keeping something
from me?

01:44:22.847 --> 01:44:24.313
Come with me.

01:44:24.315 --> 01:44:25.784
What?

01:44:27.852 --> 01:44:29.251
Why aren't you happy?

01:44:29.253 --> 01:44:31.019
I thought you'd be delirious.

01:44:31.021 --> 01:44:34.723
Well, we are happy,
if you mean it. Very.

01:44:34.725 --> 01:44:36.792
But how will you manage Henry?

01:44:36.794 --> 01:44:39.761
By altering the way
we manage each other.

01:44:39.763 --> 01:44:41.262
And it may not be easy,

01:44:41.264 --> 01:44:44.033
but I've decided
that I'm staying with him.

01:44:44.035 --> 01:44:46.301
I just don't understand
what changed your mind.

01:44:46.303 --> 01:44:48.304
It was something
Mr. Branson said

01:44:48.306 --> 01:44:50.605
about deciding what matters.

01:44:50.607 --> 01:44:53.609
For me, the Crown matters more
than any of us.

01:44:53.611 --> 01:44:55.210
I can make it work.

01:44:55.212 --> 01:44:57.979
Branson? The Irish republican?

01:44:57.981 --> 01:45:00.181
Oh, you're well-informed.

01:45:00.183 --> 01:45:02.016
I'm better informed
than you know.

01:45:02.018 --> 01:45:04.353
So, he persuaded you to do this?

01:45:04.355 --> 01:45:06.854
Oh, we were talking
after the parade.

01:45:06.856 --> 01:45:08.592
Oh, there he is.

01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:11.225
Ah.

01:45:11.227 --> 01:45:14.762
Say something nice. Please.

01:45:14.764 --> 01:45:17.232
I have to say, it's
been very quiet without you.

01:45:17.234 --> 01:45:19.768
Mr. Branson.

01:45:19.770 --> 01:45:23.973
I wish we had spoken more
while we were at Downton Abbey.

01:45:23.975 --> 01:45:26.074
- Do you, sir?
- Certainly.

01:45:26.076 --> 01:45:29.310
I believe I have more than one
reason to be grateful to you.

01:45:29.312 --> 01:45:31.081
More than one.

01:45:37.855 --> 01:45:39.287
What was that all about?

01:45:39.289 --> 01:45:41.256
I'll tell you when we're alone.

01:45:41.258 --> 01:45:43.257
Why more than one?

01:45:44.395 --> 01:45:45.860
Who is she?

01:45:45.862 --> 01:45:47.261
That's Princess Mary.

01:45:47.263 --> 01:45:49.364
She was at Downton
for the parade yesterday.

01:45:49.366 --> 01:45:50.899
Didn't you see her?

01:45:50.901 --> 01:45:52.301
Not at the parade.

01:45:52.303 --> 01:45:55.173
But I saw her afterwards
at the tea.

01:46:11.288 --> 01:46:13.855
So, you see,
she has Brompton blood,

01:46:13.857 --> 01:46:15.957
albeit from an unusual angle.

01:46:15.959 --> 01:46:18.092
Why did you not say this
long ago?

01:46:18.094 --> 01:46:20.194
It seemed too great a leap
for you.

01:46:20.196 --> 01:46:22.730
Well, who do you think I am?

01:46:22.732 --> 01:46:25.434
Some maiden aunt
who's never left the village?

01:46:25.436 --> 01:46:27.903
Obviously not.

01:46:27.905 --> 01:46:31.974
Well, don't think I approve,
because I don't.

01:46:31.976 --> 01:46:34.810
But at least I understand.

01:46:34.812 --> 01:46:37.712
Does Miss Smith know the truth?

01:46:37.714 --> 01:46:39.715
Yes, she does.

01:46:39.717 --> 01:46:42.150
When I get home,
I will hire another maid,

01:46:42.152 --> 01:46:43.885
and Lucy can be my companion.

01:46:43.887 --> 01:46:45.186
Well, that's much more suitable.

01:46:45.188 --> 01:46:47.189
And I'm afraid
you'll dislike it,

01:46:47.191 --> 01:46:49.390
but she says
that she and Tom Branson

01:46:49.392 --> 01:46:51.126
have agreed to correspond.

01:46:51.128 --> 01:46:52.694
Dislike it?

01:46:52.696 --> 01:46:54.930
I will lick the stamps myself.

01:46:59.270 --> 01:47:02.304
You are amazing, Violet.

01:47:02.306 --> 01:47:04.006
You haven't won, you know.

01:47:04.008 --> 01:47:06.108
I don't believe in defeat.

01:47:06.110 --> 01:47:07.975
But we can hammer this out

01:47:07.977 --> 01:47:10.479
when you come back to stay,
you and Lucy,

01:47:10.481 --> 01:47:13.015
when you've finished
your tour of duty.

01:47:13.017 --> 01:47:16.154
You mean I am once more
a member of this family?

01:47:21.459 --> 01:47:24.193
She's right, you know.
Brompton is gone.

01:47:24.195 --> 01:47:26.862
And you must all learn
to live with it.

01:47:26.864 --> 01:47:29.765
I think we can get it back.

01:47:29.767 --> 01:47:32.234
For Tom, at least.

01:47:32.236 --> 01:47:35.203
That's why we need the girl
back here.

01:47:35.205 --> 01:47:37.405
Oh, Violet.

01:47:37.407 --> 01:47:41.143
After all these years,
you still astonish me.

01:47:41.145 --> 01:47:43.278
Oh, good.
I'm glad I'm a revelation

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.012
and not a disappointment.

01:47:48.319 --> 01:47:50.985
- It's very important.
- Quite right.

01:47:50.987 --> 01:47:53.154
- Oh, there they are now. Do ask.
- Ah, yes.

01:47:53.156 --> 01:47:54.823
There you are, Hexham.

01:47:54.825 --> 01:47:57.926
I'm sad you can't be part
of the prince's tour,

01:47:57.928 --> 01:48:00.095
but we'll find something else
for you to do.

01:48:00.097 --> 01:48:02.363
- What?
- Sir, I-I didn't, um...

01:48:02.365 --> 01:48:04.867
I understood why not, uh,

01:48:04.869 --> 01:48:07.469
as soon as Her Majesty
had explained it to me.

01:48:07.471 --> 01:48:09.537
Congratulations to you both.

01:48:24.888 --> 01:48:26.889
You're looking very sunny tonight.

01:48:26.891 --> 01:48:29.024
I'm happy.
Why? Does it bother you?

01:48:29.026 --> 01:48:31.460
No. But tell me,
what are you playing at

01:48:31.462 --> 01:48:34.195
- with Tom and Cousin Maud's famous maid?
- What do you mean?

01:48:34.197 --> 01:48:35.930
I heard you
at dinner last night.

01:48:35.932 --> 01:48:37.299
What are you up to?

01:48:37.301 --> 01:48:39.568
You know she'll inherit
the Brompton estate.

01:48:39.570 --> 01:48:42.171
- Well, so Mama told me.
- Well, then,

01:48:42.173 --> 01:48:45.541
wouldn't you like Tom
to have a proper establishment?

01:48:45.543 --> 01:48:48.210
Oh, you devious cat.

01:48:48.212 --> 01:48:50.444
Will they be happy?
Do you think they will?

01:48:50.446 --> 01:48:53.247
Oh, I just want a word
with Granny.

01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:08.063
How long were you
planning to wait

01:49:08.065 --> 01:49:10.465
before you told us why
you really went up to London

01:49:10.467 --> 01:49:12.033
on Wednesday?

01:49:12.035 --> 01:49:15.537
Since you ask,
I haven't decided.

01:49:15.539 --> 01:49:17.038
So, if I tell you now,

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:19.073
will you promise
to keep it to yourself?

01:49:19.075 --> 01:49:20.975
I promise.

01:49:20.977 --> 01:49:23.244
Very well. I...

01:49:23.246 --> 01:49:26.314
I had some medical tests
a few weeks ago,

01:49:26.316 --> 01:49:29.952
and I went up to London
to hear the results.

01:49:29.954 --> 01:49:32.386
- Yes?
- And, uh,

01:49:32.388 --> 01:49:36.127
I may not have long to live.

01:49:37.561 --> 01:49:39.560
It won't be too quick.

01:49:39.562 --> 01:49:41.262
But, of course,

01:49:41.264 --> 01:49:43.868
you can never get
a London doctor to be precise.

01:49:44.968 --> 01:49:46.368
- Oh, Granny.
- No.

01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:47.869
No, no.

01:49:47.871 --> 01:49:50.372
My dear, save your tears
for something sad.

01:49:50.374 --> 01:49:53.140
Th-There's nothing sad here.

01:49:53.142 --> 01:49:56.612
I have lived a privileged
and an interesting life,

01:49:56.614 --> 01:49:59.081
and now it's...

01:49:59.083 --> 01:50:00.983
it's time to go.

01:50:00.985 --> 01:50:03.085
I'm leaving the family

01:50:03.087 --> 01:50:06.287
and the place that I treasure

01:50:06.289 --> 01:50:08.392
in talented hands.

01:50:10.127 --> 01:50:12.127
- Well, I know Papa will be...
- Oh, no, no.

01:50:12.129 --> 01:50:13.595
No, I don't mean your father.

01:50:13.597 --> 01:50:15.930
I... No, I-I love him dearly.

01:50:15.932 --> 01:50:18.667
No, I... I mean you.

01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:21.940
You are the future of Downton.

01:50:23.374 --> 01:50:25.540
But I have such doubts, Granny.

01:50:25.542 --> 01:50:27.943
Are we right
to keep it all going

01:50:27.945 --> 01:50:29.978
when the world it was built for

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:32.680
is fading
with every day that passes?

01:50:32.682 --> 01:50:35.516
Will George and Caroline
still be living that life?

01:50:35.518 --> 01:50:37.985
- Are we living it now?
- No, no.

01:50:37.987 --> 01:50:41.924
Our ancestors
lived different lives from us,

01:50:41.926 --> 01:50:44.559
and our descendants
will live differently again,

01:50:44.561 --> 01:50:48.266
but Downton Abbey
will be part of them.

01:50:49.365 --> 01:50:50.933
Won't be the same without you.

01:50:50.935 --> 01:50:52.567
Of course it will.

01:50:52.569 --> 01:50:55.938
You'll take over
from where I left off.

01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:58.140
You'll be
the frightening old lady

01:50:58.142 --> 01:51:00.074
keeping everyone up to the mark.

01:51:00.076 --> 01:51:02.411
Thank you very much.

01:51:02.413 --> 01:51:04.246
You will, my darling.

01:51:04.248 --> 01:51:07.282
And you'll do it wonderfully.

01:51:07.284 --> 01:51:11.552
You're the best of me
that will live on.

01:51:11.554 --> 01:51:13.988
Hurrah.

01:51:15.325 --> 01:51:17.326
Oh, Granny, I love you so much.

01:51:17.328 --> 01:51:20.095
No, shh.

01:51:20.097 --> 01:51:21.563
But should you be here tonight?

01:51:21.565 --> 01:51:23.230
Won't you be worn out?

01:51:23.232 --> 01:51:25.533
Oh, Mary, I can't spend
the rest of my life

01:51:25.535 --> 01:51:27.702
in a shower of
"How are you feeling?"

01:51:27.704 --> 01:51:29.704
and "Are you quite well?"
Oh, no.

01:51:29.706 --> 01:51:33.475
The point is...
I'll be fine until I'm not.

01:51:33.477 --> 01:51:35.176
That's all there is to it.

01:51:35.178 --> 01:51:37.179
Ah, there you are.

01:51:37.181 --> 01:51:39.314
- The dancing's starting.
- Ah.

01:51:39.316 --> 01:51:40.983
You mustn't miss it.

01:51:40.985 --> 01:51:42.717
No. Thank you.

01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:49.056
Thank you.

01:51:49.058 --> 01:51:52.496
You know, you'll always be
with us, Granny.

01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:55.997
Staring from every picture,

01:51:55.999 --> 01:52:00.202
talking from every book,
as long as the house stands.

01:52:00.204 --> 01:52:02.537
Sounds very exhausting.

01:52:02.539 --> 01:52:05.239
Do you know, I think...

01:52:05.241 --> 01:52:07.743
I should prefer
to rest in peace.

01:52:09.445 --> 01:52:11.345
Come on.

01:52:51.054 --> 01:52:53.055
Darling.

01:53:02.732 --> 01:53:04.198
What is it you want?

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.201
We have things in common.

01:53:06.203 --> 01:53:08.269
The boys, horses, racing.

01:53:08.271 --> 01:53:11.206
And there must be more
if we look for it.

01:53:11.208 --> 01:53:13.574
I want us to be friends.

01:53:13.576 --> 01:53:15.676
Well, we'll have to see.

01:53:15.678 --> 01:53:17.378
No, dear.

01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:19.146
We'll have to change.

01:53:19.148 --> 01:53:20.448
Both of us.

01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:22.184
How did that happen?

01:53:22.186 --> 01:53:23.452
Was it you, Mama?

01:53:23.454 --> 01:53:24.653
How did you do it?

01:53:24.655 --> 01:53:26.121
Simple.

01:53:26.123 --> 01:53:27.855
Bertie asked the king.

01:53:27.857 --> 01:53:29.591
I asked the queen.

01:53:35.632 --> 01:53:37.765
I do love our adventures.

01:53:37.767 --> 01:53:40.668
But isn't it fun
when they're over?

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.185
What are you doing here?

01:53:58.187 --> 01:54:01.122
I wanted to see the dancing,
so I thought I'd pretend

01:54:01.124 --> 01:54:03.390
I was bringing Lady Bagshaw
a handkerchief.

01:54:03.392 --> 01:54:05.393
I can give it to her,
if you'd like.

01:54:09.866 --> 01:54:11.835
I wish you could dance with me.

01:54:48.605 --> 01:54:50.337
I've got a question for you.

01:54:50.339 --> 01:54:51.540
Hmm?

01:54:51.542 --> 01:54:53.207
You'd never want
to leave Downton

01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:55.710
and start up somewhere else,
would you?

01:54:55.712 --> 01:54:57.345
And tell me truthfully.

01:54:57.347 --> 01:54:58.412
What brought this on?

01:54:58.414 --> 01:54:59.680
Just tell me.

01:54:59.682 --> 01:55:01.416
Leave Downton?

01:55:01.418 --> 01:55:04.155
I think we're stuck with it,
aren't we?

01:55:05.222 --> 01:55:06.590
Yes.

01:55:07.691 --> 01:55:10.692
Yes, I believe we are.

01:56:34.343 --> 01:56:36.344
We shouldn't come out this way.

01:56:36.346 --> 01:56:38.613
Oh, they won't mind.

01:56:38.615 --> 01:56:41.049
Not this once.

01:56:41.051 --> 01:56:44.985
Well, they've gone,
and Downton is still standing.

01:56:44.987 --> 01:56:47.721
Elsie, a hundred years from now,

01:56:47.723 --> 01:56:49.991
Downton will still be standing.

01:56:49.993 --> 01:56:53.231
And the Crawleys
will still be here.

01:56:54.498 --> 01:56:57.532
And that is a promise.

01:56:57.534 --> 01:56:59.833
We'll see, Charlie.

01:56:59.835 --> 01:57:01.635
We'll see.

01:57:32.189 --> 01:57:37.189
