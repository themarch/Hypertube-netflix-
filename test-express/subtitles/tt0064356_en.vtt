00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:17.022
Catch him, don't let him get away.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.572
Hit him, hit him!

00:04:56.444 --> 00:04:59.711
What's going on, why are you doing that?
Get out of here.

00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:03.521
- Why are you hurting him, huh?
- We didn't do anything to him.

00:05:03.847 --> 00:05:05.570
Oh no?
Why did you through him in the water?

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.708
Who will take care of him
if something happens?

00:05:08.828 --> 00:05:15.434
It's all Saffar's son's fault, he's
always playing with kids half himself.

00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:19.359
It's my fault? Ok then,
Guys...lets show him

00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:35.784
- Hello chief.
- Hello.

00:05:36.478 --> 00:05:38.098
I wonder, chief

00:05:38.858 --> 00:05:45.080
This son of Saffar has been a trouble
ever since he came back from city.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.274
He has learned these well.

00:06:13.113 --> 00:06:17.774
Are you going to buy milk?
Hasan's pasturing his cow

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:21.989
And one cow is all we have
in this village.

00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:30.330
- Hi Hassan.
- Get out of the way, hi.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:38.131
Come and sit have a tea with
us, Come give it a break.

00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:47.079
Keep away, Come hold this kid.

00:10:52.646 --> 00:10:55.076
Go away, don't stand here,
Keep away from her.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:58.911
Go on, Get out of here.

00:11:00.337 --> 00:11:02.453
- Here you are.
- Thank you chief.

00:11:03.974 --> 00:11:06.106
Where have you been?

00:11:07.147 --> 00:11:10.870
This poor man has been
waiting for a little milk.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.870
I took her gazing.

00:11:13.581 --> 00:11:16.341
- Don't give her that, she will be sick
- Get away kid.

00:11:16.678 --> 00:11:20.959
What is it Hasan?
You are so touchy today.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.951
The damn bolouries are here again.

00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:29.209
What? Bolouri? Where?

00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:33.374
- For god's sake, keep away!
- I told you to get away.

00:11:37.346 --> 00:11:39.263
I saw them on top of the hill
on my way back.

00:11:39.544 --> 00:11:40.982
How many were there?

00:11:41.606 --> 00:11:44.201
Those three...as always.

00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:53.821
See? Chief, I keep telling you we should
do something about it, but nobody listens.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.534
- Now what do we do?
- There is nothing we can do.

00:12:00.266 --> 00:12:07.496
These bolouries don't believe in anything.
We have to leave it to god.

00:12:11.046 --> 00:12:15.075
They'll get worse if
we don't do anything.

00:12:15.195 --> 00:12:17.953
They have taken three of my sheeps.

00:12:18.685 --> 00:12:23.604
They ruined me and no
one did anything about it.

00:12:23.724 --> 00:12:26.796
And now Hassan's cow is next I suppose.

00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:30.074
Huh?... My turn?

00:12:30.194 --> 00:12:34.312
No... God forbid.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:43.103
Let me tell you this. My blood
boils when I hear their name.

00:12:43.223 --> 00:12:45.929
I'll take my revenge no matter what.

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:50.167
-  What can you do?
-  I'll do something.

00:12:50.287 --> 00:12:56.132
Right! You're scared of them like hell.
What in the world can you do to?

00:12:57.702 --> 00:13:01.312
The boy has no manners.

00:13:04.609 --> 00:13:11.673
Hassan, don't take your cow out.
You don’t need her to gaze all day long.

00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:15.440
He's right.
Why do you take the pregnant cow out?

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.149
Leave her in the cowshed.
It's almost time for her.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.783
Where to? Stay a little.

00:13:28.903 --> 00:13:30.667
I have to take her to the cowshed.

00:13:30.787 --> 00:13:36.004
I want to sleep early.
I must take off to work early in the morning.

00:13:36.124 --> 00:13:39.615
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:53.586
Woman! Give me that lamp.

00:13:57.039 --> 00:13:58.452
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:14:28.216 --> 00:14:36.065
Let's make sure there
is nothing to harm her.

00:14:47.995 --> 00:14:48.623
Give it.

00:15:14.053 --> 00:15:18.605
-I'll sleep in the cowshed tonight.
-why what's the matter?

00:15:18.725 --> 00:15:22.844
Blories are hanging around.
Give me the lamp.

00:18:10.686 --> 00:18:18.378
My life... my dear.

00:19:17.715 --> 00:19:19.285
- Is it Bolour's?
- Yes.

00:19:19.405 --> 00:19:21.639
- Did you steal it?
- Yes.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.483
Oh God.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.013
Why did this happen to me? Oh God.

00:23:10.498 --> 00:23:12.729
What is it? What's wrong?

00:23:16.674 --> 00:23:20.168
Move aside, move aside.

00:23:20.288 --> 00:23:23.964
Get out of there.

00:23:27.385 --> 00:23:29.319
Run Esmayil

00:23:33.187 --> 00:23:35.865
Breath, Breath.

00:23:35.985 --> 00:23:39.732
- Breath!
- Give her some water.

00:23:39.852 --> 00:23:42.261
Shake her arms...

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:48.360
God help her.

00:23:50.146 --> 00:23:53.567
Eat, Eat,
In the name of God.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.559
Eslam?  Eslam?

00:24:01.303 --> 00:24:04.575
- Is something wrong?
- Mind your own business.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.195
Why did this happen to me?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.749
It's terrible...I'm ruined.

00:24:14.493 --> 00:24:19.550
- What is it?
- Tell us what happened, say something!

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.842
Hasan's cow died.

00:24:41.065 --> 00:24:48.949
I took her some water and found her lying
on the ground, with blood everywhere.

00:24:50.635 --> 00:24:56.214
But why? She wasn't ill, was she?

00:24:56.746 --> 00:25:03.589
No, she was fine this morning.
She was eating nonstop.

00:25:04.234 --> 00:25:06.664
It must be the evil eye!

00:25:08.223 --> 00:25:12.587
What evil eye?
She says blood came from her mouth.

00:25:13.876 --> 00:25:20.521
There you have it!
God save us all from evil eye.

00:25:21.165 --> 00:25:23.956
Eslam? Eslam? Is there something wrong?

00:25:26.497 --> 00:25:30.636
Leave me be for god's sake.

00:25:33.215 --> 00:25:37.678
What am I to do now? Tell me what to do.

00:25:39.314 --> 00:25:45.887
Nothing. What could you do?
She's dead, and she'll never be back!

00:25:49.358 --> 00:25:52.780
What should we do now, Eslam?

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:35.078
Poor Hasan, poor Hasan...

00:26:35.198 --> 00:26:37.756
Maybe it was a snake.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:45.690
Believe it or not, I
say Bolouries did this!

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:51.590
- How could the bolouries have done it?
- It's clear they did this.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:55.359
Any person or animal dies
it’s their fault?

00:26:55.479 --> 00:27:03.094
Yes those heathen's steal
what ever they can, and kill the rest.

00:27:03.214 --> 00:27:07.095
What good does arguing do us?

00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:11.310
Let’s be calm
and think of what we can do.

00:27:14.037 --> 00:27:17.260
See? chief, What am I to do now?

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:23.938
Can you imagine how Hasan
would react to finding his cow is dead?

00:27:24.483 --> 00:27:28.054
She's right, she's right...

00:27:29.392 --> 00:27:36.136
I know how he'd feel when he finds out.

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:40.153
What should we do chief?

00:27:40.897 --> 00:27:43.971
I can’t come up with anything.

00:27:54.165 --> 00:27:55.256
Listen!

00:27:55.376 --> 00:28:01.751
When Hasan comes back
nobody tells him his cow is dead, ok?

00:28:01.871 --> 00:28:08.247
Don't tell him, but when he doesn’t
find his cow, He'll figure it out.

00:28:08.892 --> 00:28:10.429
Won’t he chief?

00:28:12.165 --> 00:28:20.297
He's right, Eslam, When he doesn't
find the cow he'll figure it out

00:28:25.154 --> 00:28:31.799
Listen, nobody tells him that his cow
is dead, His wife tells him that the cow....

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:33.981
...That the cow is dead.

00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:39.683
- Would you let him finish?
- I'm not stopping him!

00:28:41.865 --> 00:28:45.038
His wife will tell him
that the cow ran away.

00:28:45.158 --> 00:28:49.600
Hassan won't believe that.
He knows his cow would never ran away.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:56.377
He's right, Eslam.
A pregnant cow would never run away.

00:28:56.497 --> 00:29:01.237
You want to tell him his cow
is dead? That would kill him!

00:29:04.311 --> 00:29:11.402
His wife will tell him that his cow
ran away and Esmayil went after her!

00:29:11.522 --> 00:29:16.212
But Eslam, I'm here.
I haven't gone anywhere.

00:29:16.812 --> 00:29:19.886
We'll just suppose you've gone
after the cow, Let’s just suppose.

00:29:20.006 --> 00:29:22.415
Thank god, It's solved

00:29:25.043 --> 00:29:31.192
Tell me, Eslam.
What are we to do with the cow, now?

00:29:31.787 --> 00:29:38.332
We must hide her somewhere,
So Hassan doesn't find her.

00:29:38.452 --> 00:29:43.588
How about skinning the cow
before hiding it?

00:29:43.708 --> 00:29:46.464
No, We won’t do that.

00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:50.800
First of all it's a sin
to use the skin of a dead animal

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:56.304
Secondly, What if Hassan
shows up and finds out?

00:29:56.424 --> 00:29:59.874
How about using Eslam's cart
and dumping it in the valley?

00:30:03.048 --> 00:30:10.734
No people would hear and
Hassan would hear of it sooner or later

00:30:11.428 --> 00:30:13.312
Then what can we do?

00:30:14.849 --> 00:30:16.832
I really don't know

00:30:57.446 --> 00:31:02.344
May god help us.
It's such a tragedy

00:31:04.824 --> 00:31:07.964
May god help us.

00:31:45.264 --> 00:31:46.851
Turn her around

00:34:07.189 --> 00:34:12.643
Now...Everyone be careful
not tell Hassan about this.

00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:14.920
Hopefully no one would say anything

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.234
Even if nobody tells anything, He will.

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:22.507
Hey boy.

00:34:23.598 --> 00:34:25.631
I'm talking, Listen carefully.

00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:28.705
Don't you tell Hassan anything!

00:34:35.746 --> 00:34:38.424
Come here, come!

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:40.953
Move it!

00:34:46.895 --> 00:34:51.953
Don't Hassan his cow is dead, got it?

00:34:57.705 --> 00:34:59.986
Right.

00:35:01.473 --> 00:35:04.449
He won't tell anything.
He's not that stupid.

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:10.399
Wait a second! You'll tell Hassan
that his cow is dead, wont you?

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.297
Yes.

00:35:20.875 --> 00:35:23.454
There is an easy solution to this.

00:35:23.574 --> 00:35:28.165
We'll tie him in the old mill
until it colls down.

00:35:29.156 --> 00:35:30.892
Yes that's right.

00:35:32.592 --> 00:35:34.146
- Esmayil?
- Yes.

00:35:34.592 --> 00:35:37.617
You'd better go hide
so that Hassan doesn’t see you.

00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:44.754
- Well...I'll just stay home.
- No, it's better if you come to our place.

00:35:44.874 --> 00:35:48.142
He's right, go to Abbas's place!

00:37:24.808 --> 00:37:32.941
Dear god and savior,
help us...save us from this evil!

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.175
Sit down

00:39:40.529 --> 00:39:41.273
Let’s go

00:40:56.941 --> 00:41:00.958
- Hassani? Hassani?
- What?

00:41:01.078 --> 00:41:03.735
- My brother is going to Bolour.
- So?

00:41:05.322 --> 00:41:08.892
- It’d be good if you go along.
- Why?

00:41:09.012 --> 00:41:11.817
Well, you know the way better
than he does.

00:41:12.611 --> 00:41:16.528
- Why does he want to go to Bolour?
- He says he wants to get even.

00:41:16.648 --> 00:41:20.446
If you go with him you can sleep over
at our place when you come back.

00:41:20.566 --> 00:41:22.330
He won't let me spend the night.

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:27.487
He wouldn't know, he's a heavy sleeper.
I'd call you once he's asleep.

00:41:31.548 --> 00:41:33.978
Why are you sitting there Abbas?

00:41:34.098 --> 00:41:38.440
Eslam told me to stay watch
till Hassan shows up.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.068
It's late, he won't come this late.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:50.391
Where are you two going?

00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:44.480
Is this all you got?

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.116
Yes.

00:43:46.236 --> 00:43:49.984
What about the sheep, then?
I thought you had gone after the sheep.

00:43:52.414 --> 00:43:54.546
As hard as we looked
we couldn't find them.

00:43:59.651 --> 00:44:01.784
You and your stealing.

00:44:33.515 --> 00:44:35.152
He's near!

00:44:36.573 --> 00:44:39.300
Hasan is coming! Hassan is coming!

00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:42.163
Hasan is coming! Hassan is coming!

00:44:44.411 --> 00:44:46.411
Hasan is coming! Hassan is coming!

00:44:47.105 --> 00:44:49.122
Hasan is coming! Hassan is coming!

00:44:49.402 --> 00:44:52.195
Eslam, Hassan is coming!

00:44:52.315 --> 00:44:53.831
- He's coming?
- Yes.

00:44:55.815 --> 00:45:01.021
Don't stand here!
Get to your work everyone.

00:45:01.733 --> 00:45:04.576
Go away, go!

00:45:14.463 --> 00:45:15.571
Hello!

00:45:27.531 --> 00:45:29.299
Hassan? Hassan?

00:45:30.307 --> 00:45:31.597
Hassan? Hassan?

00:45:32.137 --> 00:45:34.566
Go home, your wife has news for you.

00:46:41.066 --> 00:46:44.091
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:46:46.121 --> 00:46:48.286
Nice to see you here.

00:46:50.898 --> 00:46:53.856
I came to see how Ms. Nasrin is doing.

00:46:54.567 --> 00:46:55.575
That's so kind of you.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.480
Did you give her water?

00:47:29.062 --> 00:47:30.715
I asked if you gave the cow water!?

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:38.781
For god's sake, one day away from home
is enough for the cow to die of thirst.

00:48:33.584 --> 00:48:36.758
Well, Hassan, how is everything?

00:48:43.055 --> 00:48:44.344
Eslam...

00:48:48.196 --> 00:48:48.559
Come here.

00:48:54.808 --> 00:48:57.754
- Is something going on?
- What do you mean?

00:49:00.895 --> 00:49:04.349
Everybody is avoiding me!

00:49:05.019 --> 00:49:07.201
No, there's nothing wrong,
Don’t worry!

00:49:25.637 --> 00:49:26.662
What is it Hassan?

00:49:27.703 --> 00:49:34.117
It’s an amulet I bought for her,
to hang around her neck.

00:49:35.456 --> 00:49:41.479
- Hang around whose neck?
- The cow, of course, see like this.

00:49:51.875 --> 00:49:55.148
Hassan, hey Hassan, Listen to me!

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:08.714
Hassan? Listen, didn't your wife tell you?

00:50:08.834 --> 00:50:11.177
Didn’t say what?

00:50:11.297 --> 00:50:14.830
- That Esmayil went after her.
- After whom?

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:19.834
- After the cow, didn't she tell you?
- The cow? What cow?

00:50:19.954 --> 00:50:21.603
She ran away.

00:50:25.669 --> 00:50:28.446
Who?...Who ran away?

00:50:31.783 --> 00:50:34.923
Your cow, your cow ran away!

00:51:01.939 --> 00:51:07.824
Don't worry, it's nothing, she must be around.
Esmayil will find her and bring her back.

00:51:15.514 --> 00:51:16.305
Hassan...

00:52:10.179 --> 00:52:12.344
Hassan? Hassan?

00:52:12.962 --> 00:52:15.722
Come, listen to me...Hassan.

00:52:20.086 --> 00:52:24.330
Hassan? Esmayil is after her.
He'll find her.

00:52:30.908 --> 00:52:34.677
Hassan? Esmayil is after her
he'll find her.

00:52:40.338 --> 00:52:44.503
It's nothing to worry about, Hassan.

00:53:59.056 --> 00:54:01.618
My cow didn't run away, Eslam!

00:54:11.447 --> 00:54:14.554
My cow wouldn't run away!

00:54:59.944 --> 00:55:02.241
What a crazy situation

00:55:03.713 --> 00:55:08.183
Every time I hear a sound
I think it might be Hassan.

00:55:08.993 --> 00:55:11.390
He's home, he's not feeling well.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:16.002
- Have they told him his cow is dead?
- Yes, he thinks it's still in the cowshed.

00:55:18.509 --> 00:55:20.591
- That the cow is in cowshed?
- Yes.

00:55:25.847 --> 00:55:29.583
I'd better go, then.

00:55:29.703 --> 00:55:32.132
They told him
you were gone after the cow.

00:55:35.389 --> 00:55:38.118
So...what am I supposed to do?

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:42.382
Nothing...just stay here.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:19.101
- He's broken loose.
- Leave him alone, let him be.

00:56:23.481 --> 00:56:27.138
- Hello ma'am.
- Hi.

00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:30.229
- We're here to see Hassan.
- Quiet.

00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:31.213
What's going on?

00:56:31.824 --> 00:56:35.097
He's up on the roof.

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:37.543
What's he doing up there?

00:56:37.973 --> 00:56:44.915
He says my cow don't run away
she's right here.

00:56:46.568 --> 00:56:49.130
What should we do, Eslam?

00:56:49.563 --> 00:56:52.026
Yes, Eslam, what can we do?

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:58.188
We should try to talk to him.

00:57:09.735 --> 00:57:15.930
- Hello Hassan.
- Hello.

00:57:25.826 --> 00:57:30.220
Eslam, why did you do that?

00:57:32.171 --> 00:57:33.113
Why?

00:57:34.766 --> 00:57:37.559
Chief, you ask him.

00:57:38.667 --> 00:57:43.221
What did I ever do to him?
Why did he lie to me?

00:57:46.791 --> 00:57:49.915
The truth is...I...

00:57:51.624 --> 00:57:59.178
Hassan, Eslam never lied to you.
It's true, you cow did run away.

00:58:02.945 --> 00:58:06.036
My cow wouldn't run away.

00:58:07.127 --> 00:58:11.973
If she were to run away,
where could she go?

00:58:12.093 --> 00:58:14.569
Your cow ran away, Hassan.

00:58:14.689 --> 00:58:19.586
Hassan, you went to the cowshed
and looked for yourself this morning.

00:58:20.528 --> 00:58:22.859
I didn't lie to you.

00:58:23.222 --> 00:58:25.900
My cow is right here, in the cowshed.

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.080
If she's right here
why don't you go to her?

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.865
Yes, just go to the cowshed then.

00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:34.104
- Go on!
- Yes go on!

00:58:35.906 --> 00:58:38.621
I'm here watching.

00:58:39.778 --> 00:58:41.018
Watching what?

00:58:43.337 --> 00:58:48.395
The Bolouries want to come
and steal my cow tonight.

00:58:55.778 --> 00:58:56.803
How do you know?

00:59:02.202 --> 00:59:09.227
If Bolouries want to steal your cow,
Why are you sitting here? go stay near her.

00:59:10.979 --> 00:59:12.728
No, the moon will be out any time now.

00:59:15.158 --> 00:59:16.431
There it is.

00:59:18.266 --> 00:59:20.745
It's rising over Bolour.

00:59:26.835 --> 00:59:31.347
Hassan you are sitting here,
what if she gets thirsty.

00:59:31.886 --> 00:59:35.587
I'll take her water, when the moon is out.

00:59:35.707 --> 00:59:38.073
What if the moon doesn't come out?

00:59:40.166 --> 00:59:45.142
The moon will come out
when my cow is thirsty.

01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:28.333
Eslam, is there something wrong?

01:01:45.872 --> 01:01:48.682
- Eslam, what's this noise?
- I don't know.

01:02:01.538 --> 01:02:05.191
- What's going on?
- It was a Bolouri.

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:43.769
I saw them with my own eyes.
They went this way. There were two of them.

01:03:08.424 --> 01:03:11.508
Let’s go, let’s go back.

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:26.991
We have to do something about it.

01:03:27.111 --> 01:03:29.404
- Hello chief.
- Hello ma'am.

01:03:29.524 --> 01:03:32.307
- How's Hassan?
- He is not well chief.

01:03:32.654 --> 01:03:39.761
After I fell asleep he went out. He came
back near dawn, soaking in blood.

01:03:48.215 --> 01:03:49.355
What's he doing now?

01:03:49.475 --> 01:03:53.035
He's making cow sound
ever since he came back.

01:03:55.894 --> 01:03:59.977
- What should we do Eslam?
- I don't know.

01:04:00.097 --> 01:04:03.001
- Let’s go and see what we can do?
- Let’s go.

01:04:16.013 --> 01:04:20.443
- Hello Hassan.
- Hello... Hi...

01:04:28.353 --> 01:04:29.246
Hassan?

01:04:30.551 --> 01:04:33.990
Hoy Hassan!

01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:40.119
Yes, Esmayil is back and
he brought your cow back.

01:04:40.239 --> 01:04:43.392
Yes Esmayil is back, here he is.

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:45.787
Hello, uncle Hassan.

01:04:45.907 --> 01:04:49.010
I finally found your cow.

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:54.217
You know where she was? She was
pasturating in the valley near Khatonabad!

01:04:54.337 --> 01:04:56.981
She's fatter than ever!

01:04:57.101 --> 01:05:03.874
Thank god she's fine, Healthy and strong.

01:05:26.882 --> 01:05:29.295
Is there something wrong with him, Eslam?

01:05:35.758 --> 01:05:38.422
Let’s go in and see what we can do.

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:57.321
Why are you stepping back?

01:05:58.097 --> 01:05:59.337
I'm not coming in.

01:06:00.212 --> 01:06:03.650
- Why not?
- I can't watch this.

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:11.286
Are you scared? Don't be
It’s just Hassan, our good old Hassan!

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:18.379
Hello, Hassan.

01:06:19.536 --> 01:06:21.586
How are you? Are you well?

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:32.575
Hey? Hassan? I'm talking to you!

01:06:43.662 --> 01:06:45.000
Are you alright? Hassan?

01:06:53.453 --> 01:06:55.453
I'm not Hassan.

01:07:03.472 --> 01:07:08.348
Don't say that, Hassan,
you are Hassan.

01:07:08.468 --> 01:07:10.646
I'm not Hassan.

01:07:13.644 --> 01:07:15.660
I'm his cow.

01:07:23.892 --> 01:07:25.825
Don't say that Hassan.

01:07:27.445 --> 01:07:31.528
You're Hassan, our old Hassan.

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:34.800
Yes, you're our old Hassan.

01:07:40.429 --> 01:07:41.834
I'm not Hassan.

01:07:46.336 --> 01:07:48.088
I'm his cow.

01:07:48.601 --> 01:07:50.287
Don't say that.

01:07:51.411 --> 01:07:56.022
God forbid if Bolouries find out.
They'd come and steal you!

01:07:56.142 --> 01:08:00.558
- Yes, they'd steal you.
- They'd cut your head off!

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:05.947
Hassan is standing watch on the roof.
He's looking after me.

01:08:08.439 --> 01:08:13.067
Cut it out, for god's sake.
What kind of a cow are you, anyway?

01:08:13.187 --> 01:08:16.843
Where's you tail,
where's your horn if you're a cow?

01:08:16.963 --> 01:08:20.761
He's right!
What do you have to say to that?

01:08:32.372 --> 01:08:37.579
Ok, stop! Calm down!
Ok, alright, just calm down.

01:08:37.699 --> 01:08:41.657
Ok, ok Hassan, calm down, calm down.

01:08:43.261 --> 01:08:47.476
Oh god, what should we do?

01:08:47.596 --> 01:08:50.847
Get it in his head, somehow!

01:08:58.543 --> 01:09:00.014
Listen to me.

01:09:02.179 --> 01:09:06.460
Yesterday, your wife came to us in panic
and said that your cow was dead.

01:09:08.047 --> 01:09:12.796
We threw your cow in the old well.

01:09:13.623 --> 01:09:16.019
- Isn't that right, Chief?
- No, it's all true!

01:09:16.139 --> 01:09:21.140
If you really were Hassan's cow,
you would have been in the well right now!

01:09:21.702 --> 01:09:24.248
And if you're not,
then you're Hassan himself

01:09:24.744 --> 01:09:29.140
Yes, I swear to god!
I swear you are Hassan!

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.363
You tell him, is this Hassan or cow?

01:09:32.483 --> 01:09:39.768
Of course it's Hassan.
It's our old Hassan...

01:09:39.888 --> 01:09:43.043
If you don't believe us,
just go look in the old well yourself.

01:09:45.241 --> 01:09:47.390
Hassan...

01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:57.824
Hassan? The Bolouries are here!

01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:04.284
They want to steal me!
They want to through me into the old well!

01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:08.036
They want to cut my head!

01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:11.854
Hassan!

01:10:13.053 --> 01:10:19.698
Come save your cow!
Come save your cow!

01:10:47.854 --> 01:10:51.441
We're not Bolouri, we are not...

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:59.918
I'm Eslam, he's the chief.

01:11:00.629 --> 01:11:03.968
That's Saffar's son, and this is Abbas.

01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:07.182
We're all from this village, friend.

01:11:10.124 --> 01:11:14.223
We're not Bolouri...let’s go...

01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:33.048
Do you want to get you anything?

01:11:38.035 --> 01:11:41.192
Water...water.

01:12:08.022 --> 01:12:08.567
Come in.

01:12:10.402 --> 01:12:13.691
- I want to go home.
- But I made lunch.

01:12:33.797 --> 01:12:34.508
Here.

01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:52.013
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

01:12:54.889 --> 01:12:57.285
I don't know how he will end up

01:12:59.745 --> 01:13:02.571
- Why aren't you eating?
- I don't feel hungry.

01:13:03.745 --> 01:13:07.877
- Do you want tea?
- No I have to go.

01:13:07.997 --> 01:13:09.315
Where to?

01:13:11.757 --> 01:13:13.625
I want to go see how everything goes.

01:13:14.005 --> 01:13:15.261
Will you be back?

01:13:17.724 --> 01:13:20.782
No, I'll go home.

01:13:35.684 --> 01:13:38.478
By the way...I told my sister.

01:13:39.007 --> 01:13:39.965
About what?

01:13:42.034 --> 01:13:44.024
Everything.

01:13:45.967 --> 01:13:52.120
After everything is back to normal, she'll
be here to ask for your hand on my behalf.

01:15:25.966 --> 01:15:30.082
Which way is it?
Do you know his house?

01:16:11.474 --> 01:16:14.350
- Who are they?
- The Bolouries.

01:16:24.657 --> 01:16:27.146
- What's going on?
- The Bolouries are here.

01:16:27.411 --> 01:16:29.527
I'll fix them.

01:16:32.832 --> 01:16:36.419
My sheep...my sheep!

01:16:37.015 --> 01:16:41.081
- Why are you shouting?
- They took my sheep!

01:16:55.416 --> 01:16:58.094
It's right here!

01:16:58.689 --> 01:17:02.011
- You stand watch we'll go in.
- Ok.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:53.109
- What happened?
- It wasn't his cow, he was there himself!

01:18:06.235 --> 01:18:08.102
Get them!

01:19:42.705 --> 01:19:46.457
What happened?
What's going on?

01:19:47.303 --> 01:19:52.543
- It's nothing, Bolouris had come to steal Hassan!
- What?

01:20:19.625 --> 01:20:23.526
- How is Hassan?
- He hasn't touched his food.

01:20:53.039 --> 01:20:53.815
Hassan...

01:25:31.185 --> 01:25:35.223
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.546
Here.

01:25:41.001 --> 01:25:41.447
Thank you.

01:25:42.406 --> 01:25:45.827
So...Eslam, how is everything?

01:25:48.651 --> 01:25:53.792
He ate everything there was in
the cowshed, last night, he ate hey!

01:25:54.221 --> 01:25:57.428
How can his stomach take it?

01:25:57.548 --> 01:26:00.669
I really don't understand.
I can only wonder!

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:03.826
It sure amazes me!

01:26:05.297 --> 01:26:09.920
I don't know how he will end up.
He's getting worse everyday

01:26:10.284 --> 01:26:13.259
He has wounds and scars
all over his body now.

01:26:14.218 --> 01:26:20.141
Eslam, you know better than any of us,
Think of a solution.

01:26:25.777 --> 01:26:28.885
I think...
How about taking him to the city?

01:26:30.489 --> 01:26:31.762
What for?

01:26:31.882 --> 01:26:34.919
We can take him to the hospital
they might be able to help him.

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:40.357
You mean they can convince him
that he's not a cow?

01:26:41.023 --> 01:26:44.990
I don't know.
But they might be able to do something.

01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:48.015
What if the hospital doesn't take him?

01:26:48.593 --> 01:26:51.353
- Why wouldn't they take him?
- What if they don't?

01:26:51.859 --> 01:26:55.909
If Eslam is suggesting it,
It must be a good idea.

01:27:07.707 --> 01:27:10.362
Who's going to take him, anyway?

01:27:13.242 --> 01:27:15.671
Me, you and Jabbar.

01:27:15.791 --> 01:27:18.514
I can't come.
I can't leave my sister by herself.

01:27:19.846 --> 01:27:24.854
Alright then, I'll go with them,
Is that alright?

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.631
Ok that's fine.

01:27:36.285 --> 01:27:39.971
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:27:41.557 --> 01:27:42.913
Have you told his wife?

01:27:43.033 --> 01:27:46.830
Yes. She's going to stay at our house,
So my sister won't be alone.

01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:50.669
That's better, You can't leave
a young woman all alone in the house.

01:28:03.632 --> 01:28:05.605
We're here to take Hassan.

01:28:50.423 --> 01:28:51.233
Hassan...

01:28:52.902 --> 01:28:58.364
Get up, get ready to go.
Come on, Get up.

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:35.505
There you go...Good!

01:29:35.625 --> 01:29:37.290
Let's go, Hassan go on.

01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:39.733
Hassan? Let's go, get going.

01:29:39.853 --> 01:29:45.560
Get moving...

01:30:27.132 --> 01:30:30.140
Come here...Get the rope.

01:30:35.852 --> 01:30:36.993
Tie him.

01:30:37.113 --> 01:30:41.257
Calm down, Easy!

01:30:46.745 --> 01:30:49.009
Abbas, tie him.

01:31:50.978 --> 01:31:55.887
We can't take him with the cart.
We must drag him to the road...

01:31:56.892 --> 01:31:58.214
Pull him.

01:33:39.734 --> 01:33:42.201
Eslam? Eslam?

01:33:44.664 --> 01:33:45.705
Eslam...

01:33:47.259 --> 01:33:49.423
Bolouries..

01:33:53.389 --> 01:33:55.736
- Let's gove faster.
- Let's go.

01:34:09.027 --> 01:34:11.743
Come on....pull!

01:34:12.586 --> 01:34:14.652
Come on guys...Pull!

01:34:45.085 --> 01:34:47.184
Come on, come.

01:34:58.886 --> 01:35:02.523
Hold on the rope chief and pull hard.

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.385
Move it, animal!

01:35:29.854 --> 01:35:31.491
Eslam!

01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:06.424
Eslam...Catch him!

01:38:08.188 --> 01:38:11.279
Hey Eslam? Eslam?

01:38:12.469 --> 01:38:14.882
Didn't you go to town with the others?

01:38:16.179 --> 01:38:16.873
I did.

01:38:17.650 --> 01:38:19.551
Then, Why are you back?

01:38:21.799 --> 01:38:23.204
I came to take my cart.

01:38:24.758 --> 01:38:26.577
What did you do with Hassan?

01:38:28.726 --> 01:38:34.858
Hassan? I'm going to bring him.

01:38:34.978 --> 01:38:37.691
So you are not taking him
to the city anymore?

01:40:00.958 --> 01:40:07.718
The End.
