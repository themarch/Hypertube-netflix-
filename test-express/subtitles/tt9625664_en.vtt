WEBVTT

00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:03.155
Goddamn it! Careful.

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:08.194
It's gotta be here
somewhere.

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:10.662
Give me your knife.

00:02:17.872 --> 00:02:19.571
Damn it!

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.387
We're in business.

00:02:36.457 --> 00:02:37.457
Let's go.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.229
And this is for you,
asshole.

00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:06.132
Here's for you.
Thank you.

00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:11.356
Here's for you.
<i>Gracias.</i>

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.595
Your dessert, sir.

00:03:17.298 --> 00:03:18.964
What is this?

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:20.832
The special pie
you ordered.

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:24.269
Apple pie.
I ordered apple pie.

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:29.354
I'll fix that right away
for you, sir. Sorry.

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:34.813
- Hey.
- Oh. Hey.

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:36.248
So, are you coming tonight?

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:41.787
Dude, she's not your mom.
She can't tell you what to do.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.356
She's not gonna even know.
Besides...

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.759
I raided my parents' cabinet.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.695
We'll have real fun tonight.

00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:52.531
I'll see
if I can sneak out.

00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:01.440
Hey, girl. You good?

00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:05.777
Yeah. Sorry.
Just daydreaming.

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:07.813
How's she treating you?

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:12.884
She's a good kid.
There's no problems.

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:16.321
She hates me.

00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:19.858
Well, you're her sister.
That's her job.

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.463
Everything's gonna
be okay, Maddie.

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:27.866
But she's going through a really
hard time right now, you know.

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:31.670
I don't know why I said that.
Of course you know.

00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:35.008
All right.

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.319
What's that?

00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.621
It's pie. You eat it.

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:53.426
You're welcome.

00:04:57.298 --> 00:04:59.765
Honey, you know
you can talk to me.

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:02.734
Like he did?

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:07.572
The customer?
Honey, some people are just rude.

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:09.374
He's an asshole.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:11.856
Don't use that language, honey.
Why not?

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.312
'Cause you don't?

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:16.581
Maybe we shouldn't have
moved here.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.785
Maybe you should quit this crappy job
where assholes get to push you around...

00:05:19.787 --> 00:05:21.653
Somebody has to
pay the bills, Emmy.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.824
I want to go home.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:29.695
Okay. My shift is nearly over.
Oh, come on.

00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:31.797
I'm already a teenager.
I can take care of myself.

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:33.732
You're 16.
Whatever.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.701
Lori is 16,
and she can do whatever she wants.

00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:37.569
She is not you.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.372
Well, you're not Mom.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.581
Okay, let me get you
some milk.

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:50.615
Finish your homework.

00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:55.987
Hey, you okay?

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:57.022
Emmy.

00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:00.125
Emmy, you okay?

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:02.794
Hey.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:04.363
Where's your inhaler?

00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:06.465
It's at home.
It's okay.

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:08.767
It's okay.

00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:23.482
We got bigger problems
than your face.

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:27.152
This thing
needs a pass code.

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:30.856
Well, what about this?

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:33.592
I don't know. Toss it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:40.465
About that phone...

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.100
Good thing
I got an app for that.

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:47.172
Boom, boom...

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:48.807
Unlocked.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.910
The hell?
All this shit's in code.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.746
Nothing but initials.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:55.781
Look.

00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:58.116
You see? There.

00:06:58.118 --> 00:07:02.754
He sent the message
to a 596 prefix.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.589
That's the police department.
Fuck!

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:07.726
Motherfucking snitch!

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.462
What's it say?

00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:13.304
I don't know. It's just an address.
Maybe a meeting spot.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.467
We need to find him

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.836
before that son of a bitch
lets them know where we are.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.038
Maybe we should let him.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.040
What?

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.744
Look, I'm gonna send him
a new meeting spot.

00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:30.515
That way, we don't have to find him.
He'll find us.

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:47.132
Hey, Steve.

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:49.634
Lieutenant, come on.

00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.939
- I'm ignoring you, Tony.
- Not today, Steve.

00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:57.242
What are you, my stalker?
I just finished a double. Can't this wait?

00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:00.245
It can't. I just got a text from Gonzales,
our CI in the flatlands.

00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:03.148
Jimmy fucking Gonzo?

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
It doesn't make sense.

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:06.785
I talked to him today.

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:10.021
He said
he was going radio silent.

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:13.191
He's not radio silent.
He just sent me a text to a meeting place.

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:14.993
And why was he
going off-grid?

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:17.662
- He wanted to lie low.
- Do you believe him?

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.869
Of course not.
He's a dealer and a CI.

00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:26.705
Paranoia
is his second nature.

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:29.074
He reached out.
Maybe it's an emergency.

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:31.042
Maybe.

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:33.545
Yeah, maybe
he was really made.

00:08:33.547 --> 00:08:35.280
Well, we need to
check it out, Steve.

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:40.018
You check out
the meeting.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.187
I'm gonna run by
his place.

00:08:58.005 --> 00:09:00.772
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I had no idea that she had left it at home.

00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:04.054
You've got to double-check. This is the
third time she's been in this month.

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:08.747
Uh, yes. No, I'm sorry.
I won't let it happen again.

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:10.181
Your sister's young.

00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:14.019
Too much excitement or trauma
can make her hyperventilate.

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:16.288
That will trigger
the asthma.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.758
The more mature she is, the less prone
she'll be to triggering these attacks.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.794
Until then, she depends on you.
Okay? Yes.

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:26.631
So how are you doing?
Are you enjoying Puerto Rico?

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.967
Yeah.
Keeping busy? Work?

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:32.771
I just want you to know,
if you're overwhelmed,

00:09:32.773 --> 00:09:35.340
you need someone to speak to,
we've got professionals here.

00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:38.109
Thank you, Doctor. I'm good.
I just want to make sure my sister's okay.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.256
This is stupid.

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:55.860
No, stupid is
leaving your inhaler at home.

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:58.964
I hate it. All the other kids
make fun of me because of it.

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.366
Why do they make fun
of you?

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:03.668
They're kids.
What kids do.

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:10.742
- When do we get to go home?
- They want to keep you overnight.

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:11.810
Again?

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.079
Yeah.

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:18.083
Stay with me.

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:22.287
Honey, I can't.
I've got to get back to work.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:25.249
Visiting hours are already over,
and I've gotta get back to my second shift.

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:28.860
I don't want to stay here
alone.

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:32.063
You'll be okay. I'll be back in the morning,
and you've got this.

00:10:36.003 --> 00:10:38.169
Hey. Hey, hey.

00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:41.673
Please?

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:57.188
Honey, I... Honey, I can't.

00:10:58.358 --> 00:11:00.859
Just because
you hate hospitals.

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:03.094
Nobody likes hospitals.

00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:06.164
Except maybe sick people.

00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:09.167
Sick people
hate them the most.

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:43.935
- Maddie, is she okay?
- Hey.

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:45.770
Yeah, she's fine.

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:48.139
<i>Scaring the bejesus
out of me.</i>

00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:49.908
Listen, I'm on my way.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.276
Yeah, baby. No rush.

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:54.312
<i>Are you doing okay?</i>
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:56.074
They're, uh...
They're keeping her overnight.

00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:58.249
And you're not gonna stay?

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:01.720
I don't know.

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:03.788
Just, after my mom's accident,
it just...

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:07.425
Spending time in hospitals,
you know?

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:12.263
Well, if you're not doing anything after
your shift, come over to my place.

00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:14.265
We could drink some boxed wine,

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.234
<i>maybe watch some trash TV.</i>

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.769
Okay.
I'll see how I feel.

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:21.272
<i>God! When did I
get so old?</i>

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:24.476
<i>Oh, I feel the same way.</i>

00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:26.745
<i>But all right.
I'll see you in a little bit.</i>

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:28.012
Thanks, honey. Bye.

00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:11.156
Goddamn it!

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:16.995
Open up, Jimmy. It's me.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.430
Jimmy!

00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:21.099
Come on! Get off your ass!

00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:30.241
Oh, fuck. Jesus Christ.

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:37.282
<i>Hello.
We are not available now. Please...</i>

00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:51.296
Oh, shit.

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:01.873
Come on, pick up, goddamn it.

00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:02.941
Pick up, I...

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:08.179
Get out of there!

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.448
Get out of there!
It's a setup!

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.084
Pierce, we gotta go.

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:26.324
Go.

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:34.132
We gotta go now!

00:15:37.637 --> 00:15:39.938
Oh! Hey, stop.

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:41.639
Stop!

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:53.451
Oh!

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.254
Oh, fuck!

00:16:00.226 --> 00:16:01.359
Oh, no.

00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:04.128
Oh, Christ.

00:16:27.253 --> 00:16:29.320
Don't move. Don't move.
You've got a gunshot wound.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:30.989
Wait, what?

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:33.124
You're gonna be okay, honey.
What's your name? Do you know?

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:34.425
Madison Taylor.

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:39.998
Why are there cops?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.066
Just standard procedure
when someone's been shot, okay?

00:16:42.068 --> 00:16:44.002
- Who's been shot?
- You. But don't worry.

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.004
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay.

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:56.214
<i>Fractured clavicle,
grazed liver.</i>

00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:58.483
Biggest complication
was the blood loss.

00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:00.651
It took four units
to try to stabilize him.

00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:06.257
I'm sorry, Detective.

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:10.261
Have you guys gotten
the guys who did this?

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:13.331
Not yet.

00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:16.634
Where's the girl?

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:20.571
What the hell
were you thinking?

00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:23.533
I saw a witness.
What the hell do you want me to do?

00:17:23.743 --> 00:17:26.411
Your gun. Your gun!

00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:29.213
Do you realize
what type of mess we're in?

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.249
I didn't see any solutions
flying out of your ass.

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:33.217
Your ballistics
are in the system!

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:36.187
We need that bullet.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.331
Now what?

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:49.300
We find her and lose her.

00:17:57.677 --> 00:17:59.610
Now, this...

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:02.513
this is the bullet buried
in your thigh muscle,

00:18:02.515 --> 00:18:04.315
about an inch
below your skin.

00:18:05.485 --> 00:18:07.485
You're quite lucky,
Madison.

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:09.687
It's actually not much more
than a puncture wound.

00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:14.692
All things considered,
it could've been much worse.

00:18:14.694 --> 00:18:19.397
You could've shattered your femur or
severed your femoral artery or...

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:21.599
Okay, I... I get it. Um...

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.469
When are you taking this
out of me?

00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:27.471
Not tonight.
Everything else checks out okay.

00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:31.409
Our surgeons are out for tonight.
We're trying to fit you in.

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.446
Probably in a day or two.
How are you feeling?

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.614
Uh...

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:40.218
A little sore.
Mostly tired.

00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:42.620
Um...

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.323
What happened
to the other man?

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:49.861
We did all we could.

00:18:49.863 --> 00:18:53.231
Which reminds me... Are you up for a visitor?
The police are here.

00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:55.867
I-I really don't remember anything.
I know.

00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:58.503
They still want
to speak with you.

00:18:58.505 --> 00:19:00.805
The detective
is quite insistent.

00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:19.191
Hi, Madison.

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.459
I'm Lieutenant Wakes.

00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:25.163
Heard you had
a pleasant night.

00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:27.231
Ah.

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:29.433
Yeah, it was wonderful.

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:35.206
You feeling up to this?

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:37.742
Up to what?

00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:39.710
Just a few questions.

00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:42.446
Just about what you saw,
who you might have seen,

00:19:42.882 --> 00:19:44.649
and what happened.

00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:47.418
Uh, I really don't
remember anything.

00:19:48.788 --> 00:19:50.354
Nothing?

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:53.691
I have to ask.
It's my job.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.661
I blacked out,
so I-I really can't help you.

00:19:56.663 --> 00:19:59.430
I'm so sorry. I-I...
I don't remember anything.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:05.503
Madison, you have to try.

00:20:05.505 --> 00:20:07.371
You have to help me.

00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:10.775
I can't help you
unless you help me.

00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:12.677
I know it's frightening.
I'm sorry.

00:20:18.818 --> 00:20:21.319
- Madison?
- Jesus, someone tried to kill me.

00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:27.291
Did you see the shooter?

00:20:27.293 --> 00:20:29.594
No, um...

00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:33.297
There were just some shadows
in the dark.

00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:36.834
Shadows?

00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:39.870
As in plural?

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:41.472
Yeah.

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:42.673
You sure?

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:47.945
Mm-hmm.
I only saw one guy by the Dumpster.

00:20:49.649 --> 00:20:50.881
No. Um...

00:20:52.652 --> 00:20:54.885
No, there were two of them.
There was...

00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:58.356
one at the, um...
at the end of the alley.

00:20:58.358 --> 00:21:01.392
Did you hear anything?
Any voices?

00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:02.893
Anything, really.

00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:04.996
I just heard, um...
heard gunshots.

00:21:06.633 --> 00:21:09.867
They sounded, um,
really sharp, small.

00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:14.438
That's a .40-caliber bullet.

00:21:16.676 --> 00:21:19.877
Doc confirmed it.
You're a very lucky girl.

00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:25.349
Do you remember anything else at all?
A name?

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:28.319
You can help me.

00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:30.955
I'm sorry.

00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:33.391
Can I ask...

00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:37.461
Who was that guy?
What is this about?

00:21:39.866 --> 00:21:41.532
He was my partner.

00:21:44.904 --> 00:21:46.837
These guys
killed a cop.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.540
They're dangerous,

00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:51.575
and you're a witness.

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.378
Are they gonna
come after me?

00:21:55.615 --> 00:21:56.714
Possible.

00:22:17.904 --> 00:22:21.038
<i>Members of the Wi family,
please report to reception,</i>

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.341
<i>located on the first floor.</i>

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:34.719
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:38.789
Sergeant Tull, Vice Division.

00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:40.791
What happened to the girl
that was here earlier,

00:22:40.793 --> 00:22:42.727
the one that was shot
in the leg?

00:22:42.729 --> 00:22:44.028
I'm not sure.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.063
They rushed her
out of here,

00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:49.033
took her somewhere else,
all hush-hush.

00:22:50.503 --> 00:22:51.769
Take us to Security.

00:23:00.446 --> 00:23:04.014
This is the seventh floor.
Infectious diseases.

00:23:04.884 --> 00:23:06.550
Not as bad as it sounds.

00:23:07.987 --> 00:23:11.789
Half the floor
is disease labs.

00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:14.658
The other half
is the isolation ward.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.995
Isolation ward?
This just gets better and better.

00:23:17.997 --> 00:23:20.030
It's where they quarantine
those patients.

00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:26.570
Don't worry. We haven't had
any outbreaks of Ebola. Yet.

00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:29.740
Am I the only one
on this floor?

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.709
Yes.

00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:34.145
This is the safest
place for you.

00:23:34.147 --> 00:23:37.548
Sorry, sir.
I, uh, just finished clearing the floor.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.750
This is Officer Jacobs.

00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:43.921
He'll be keeping an eye on you tonight,
just in case.

00:23:45.491 --> 00:23:47.825
You sure I'm gonna
be safe here?

00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:50.861
We gave you an alias.

00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:53.864
Even if the killer
could find you,

00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:57.802
there's a cop, an armed cop,
right outside your door.

00:23:58.838 --> 00:24:00.704
Wait, what about my sister?

00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:03.746
I dropped her here earlier at the
hospital before everything happened.

00:24:04.844 --> 00:24:06.477
She'll be fine.

00:24:09.982 --> 00:24:12.216
I'm really sorry
I'm a lousy witness.

00:24:13.152 --> 00:24:15.019
Oh, no, don't be.

00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:18.222
You've been a great help.

00:24:18.224 --> 00:24:19.457
Really?

00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:22.693
Well, yeah.

00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:29.600
But you did get me out of poker night,
which is really cool.

00:24:32.772 --> 00:24:36.807
Detective,
can I ask what you're doing in San Juan?

00:24:38.177 --> 00:24:40.077
Why everybody comes
to the island.

00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:43.013
Running from ghosts.

00:24:44.484 --> 00:24:45.816
You didn't know that?

00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:50.554
So, no family, huh?

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:53.157
Guys like me...

00:24:56.262 --> 00:24:57.795
don't stick around.

00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:05.202
The officer
will be outside the door.

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:08.873
If you need anything,
the nurses will be on duty.

00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:10.274
Just hit the button.

00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:14.179
That your phone?

00:25:14.914 --> 00:25:16.180
Uh, yeah.

00:25:18.217 --> 00:25:19.984
I'll put my phone in, okay?

00:25:21.254 --> 00:25:24.054
Um, my cell's on here.

00:25:24.056 --> 00:25:26.657
If you have any problems,
just call me directly.

00:25:28.261 --> 00:25:29.660
Yeah.

00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:33.531
Call Lieutenant Wakes,
not 911.

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:36.066
Perfect.

00:25:36.836 --> 00:25:37.902
Except one thing.

00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:41.238
I'd like you
to call me Steve.

00:25:43.743 --> 00:25:45.175
"To serve and protect."

00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:49.313
Let's see. Madison Taylor.

00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:53.317
And, uh, Emily Taylor.

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:56.086
Her sister, I believe.
Staying at the children's ward.

00:25:56.088 --> 00:25:58.989
Uh, no, just... just Madison.

00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:01.592
And the officer that,
uh, came by

00:26:01.594 --> 00:26:03.594
and wanted to move her,
his name was?

00:26:03.596 --> 00:26:06.630
Uh, Wakes. Lieutenant Wakes.

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:08.098
Wakes.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.968
And you said they moved her
to the seventh floor?

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.270
Yes. Quarantine room 707.

00:26:13.272 --> 00:26:16.206
That's been closed
due to Hurricane Maria's damage.

00:26:16.208 --> 00:26:19.677
Is she some kind of witness or something?
Not exactly.

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:23.047
We believe she's a person of interest
with new information that came in.

00:26:25.117 --> 00:26:27.885
Well, I can round up staff
if you need backup.

00:26:27.887 --> 00:26:29.753
No, no,
we can't involve civilians.

00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:32.990
But what you can do is lock
down that seventh floor.

00:26:32.992 --> 00:26:34.325
Well,

00:26:34.327 --> 00:26:37.094
I can initiate
an elevator lockdown

00:26:37.096 --> 00:26:41.832
that will restrict the elevators
to key-card access only.

00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:45.135
Now, the stairs, I can lock those
from here only on the stairwell side.

00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:46.837
Thanks.

00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:50.140
And do me a favor.
Alert the staff.

00:26:50.142 --> 00:26:52.977
Let them know to report
anything that's suspicious.

00:26:52.979 --> 00:26:55.679
And keep them out of our way
for their own safety.

00:26:57.817 --> 00:27:00.851
Wakes is in charge of special
projects for major crimes, right?

00:27:00.853 --> 00:27:02.653
Now we know
who's pulling the strings.

00:27:02.655 --> 00:27:05.155
Marcos and Williams
clean up the scene?

00:27:06.993 --> 00:27:08.726
Yeah.

00:27:08.728 --> 00:27:11.028
You know, Wakes is one
of those diligent fucks.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.130
He's not gonna stop at this.

00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:15.766
I'm gonna put Marcos
and Williams on him.

00:27:15.768 --> 00:27:16.834
Good idea.

00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:38.222
Yeah, we see him posted.
We'll let him know we're taking over.

00:27:38.224 --> 00:27:42.893
Whoa, hey. You guys can't be up here.
This area is off limits.

00:27:42.895 --> 00:27:45.929
Hey, relax, kid.
We're here to relieve you.

00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:49.066
Lieutenant Wakes didn't say
anything about a relief shift.

00:27:49.068 --> 00:27:52.202
Consider yourself lucky.
Why don't you take a break?

00:27:52.204 --> 00:27:54.438
I, uh, got to check with Wakes.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.441
Yeah, <i>no problemo.</i>
I have him right here.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.016
You should've taken
the night off, kiddo.

00:28:07.053 --> 00:28:08.053
Let's go.

00:28:44.423 --> 00:28:46.663
I'll lock up the stairwells.
You disable the switchboard.

00:29:43.916 --> 00:29:45.249
Officer Jacobs?

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:25.649
Is this the right room?

00:31:30.322 --> 00:31:33.457
Yeah. This is it.
Then where in the hell is she?

00:31:33.459 --> 00:31:35.626
That door's
locked from the inside.

00:31:39.398 --> 00:31:41.431
Goddamn it!
There's another door!

00:31:41.433 --> 00:31:42.499
Shit!

00:33:36.215 --> 00:33:38.115
Did you...
Yeah.

00:33:38.117 --> 00:33:39.216
Locked them out.

00:33:42.421 --> 00:33:44.087
She's near the elevator.

00:35:55.888 --> 00:36:00.223
<i>Paging Dr. Hanover.
Please report to trauma room three.</i>

00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:35.825
Open the fucking door!

00:36:43.702 --> 00:36:45.268
Open the door!

00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:51.942
Somebody... Somebody help me.

00:36:51.944 --> 00:36:53.910
<i>Somebody please help me.</i>

00:36:57.916 --> 00:36:59.816
No one's gonna help you,
Princess.

00:36:59.818 --> 00:37:03.486
I've already called the police.

00:37:03.488 --> 00:37:05.589
We are the fucking police.

00:37:05.591 --> 00:37:07.257
Open the door!

00:37:12.331 --> 00:37:14.497
Pierce, put that down.

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:25.408
<i>Madison?</i>

00:37:29.948 --> 00:37:31.748
How do you know my name?

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.351
We are the police, Madison.
We're the good guys.

00:37:34.353 --> 00:37:36.853
Everything is okay.
It's just a misunderstanding.

00:37:36.855 --> 00:37:38.855
But he was chasing me
with a gun.

00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:43.393
<i>Yeah, that was a mistake.</i>

00:37:43.395 --> 00:37:45.762
You see, my partner here
thought that you were, um...

00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:47.664
someone else.

00:37:48.834 --> 00:37:52.269
Listen.
My name is Sergeant Tull.

00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:55.338
We were responding to a call
made by Protective Services.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.574
<i>That's the police guard
that was protecting you earlier.</i>

00:37:57.576 --> 00:38:01.411
When we arrived to the scene,
we found him dead and you missing.

00:38:02.681 --> 00:38:04.281
<i>Somebody killed him.</i>

00:38:05.784 --> 00:38:08.718
- It was you. You killed him.
- No.

00:38:09.855 --> 00:38:11.554
<i>It was someone
who was after you.</i>

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.760
We secured the floor
room by room,

00:38:16.762 --> 00:38:19.296
<i>and that's when you popped up
out of nowhere.</i>

00:38:19.298 --> 00:38:21.931
My partner...

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:25.935
Detective Pierce, well,
you can tell that you spooked him pretty bad.

00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:27.604
<i>He thought you were the perp.</i>

00:38:28.407 --> 00:38:29.973
You know, it's dark,

00:38:29.975 --> 00:38:33.476
the adrenaline is pumping,
you're not thinking straight.

00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:37.580
<i>Now, yes, he did have his gun out,
but we were looking for the perp.</i>

00:38:40.018 --> 00:38:43.953
You know, this whole thing is
really one big misunderstanding.

00:38:43.955 --> 00:38:47.691
<i>But we are both relieved
that you are okay.</i>

00:38:50.796 --> 00:38:51.796
Come on.

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:53.964
Open the door.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.334
We're all on
the same team here.

00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:08.078
Okay.
<i>You made the right decision, Madison.</i>

00:39:09.481 --> 00:39:10.481
Stand by.

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:16.553
My guard,
Officer, um, Davidson.

00:39:16.555 --> 00:39:18.655
<i>What happened
to his body?</i>

00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:22.959
Officer Davidson?

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:26.896
Yes, we found his body in a...
in an empty patient room.

00:39:28.367 --> 00:39:30.367
<i>Poor kid.</i>

00:39:30.369 --> 00:39:33.470
Poor kid. His name was,
um, Officer Jacobs.

00:39:34.806 --> 00:39:36.039
Fuck.

00:39:40.112 --> 00:39:42.579
Right.
No, that's-that's what I said.

00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:43.813
<i>Officer Jacobs.</i>

00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:53.690
Can I see your badge again?
<i>Of course.</i>

00:40:05.003 --> 00:40:06.836
That's not a cop's gun.

00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:08.405
It has a silencer.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.411
<i>Madison, open the door.</i>

00:40:14.413 --> 00:40:16.045
<i>This really is the only way.</i>

00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:19.749
<i>Open the door now.</i>

00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:21.451
So much for good cop,
bad cop.

00:41:02.494 --> 00:41:04.194
No!

00:41:16.107 --> 00:41:18.007
Please leave me alone!

00:41:18.009 --> 00:41:20.543
<i>I didn't see anything!</i>

00:41:20.545 --> 00:41:23.646
It's not what you saw.
It's what you have.

00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:25.114
I don't have anything.

00:41:26.751 --> 00:41:28.618
What I want
is not on you.

00:41:29.154 --> 00:41:30.487
<i>It's in you.</i>

00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:38.661
Madison, you're bleeding.
You're dying.

00:41:38.663 --> 00:41:41.564
Open the door
so I can help you.

00:42:38.657 --> 00:42:40.297
<i>Analyzing heart rhythm.</i>

00:42:42.661 --> 00:42:44.741
<i>Do not touch the patient.</i>

00:42:47.332 --> 00:42:49.732
<i>Charging.
Stay clear of the patient.</i>

00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:57.340
<i>Press the orange button now.</i>

00:43:00.845 --> 00:43:02.679
<i>Shock delivered.</i>

00:43:26.838 --> 00:43:29.205
- Hey, Steve.
- What do you got?

00:43:29.207 --> 00:43:31.007
Got something.
Another shell.

00:43:31.009 --> 00:43:33.376
Projectile mark says
may be a Glock. Look.

00:43:33.378 --> 00:43:35.912
The lab will have to
verify, so...

00:43:36.848 --> 00:43:38.181
Tag it and bag it.

00:43:40.285 --> 00:43:42.852
Goddamn. Any bullets?

00:43:42.854 --> 00:43:46.222
Yeah. In the primary,
there are six impacts in total.

00:43:46.224 --> 00:43:49.826
Couple in Dumpster, two in asphalt,
and two right there in the wall.

00:43:49.828 --> 00:43:52.161
All hard-impact fragments.
No ballistics.

00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:54.897
Tight groups of two?

00:43:54.899 --> 00:43:58.134
Yeah, sure.
Three inches on the tarmac.

00:43:58.136 --> 00:44:00.203
And a break over there,
maybe inch, inch and a half.

00:44:00.205 --> 00:44:03.673
Right there in the Dumpster,
there's a foot between them.

00:44:03.675 --> 00:44:05.274
They got sloppy.

00:44:09.014 --> 00:44:10.213
Got something.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.149
Got two somethings.

00:44:16.788 --> 00:44:20.256
Definitely two shooters.
One forward, one behind to cover.

00:44:24.729 --> 00:44:27.063
There's gotta be
another fragment close by.

00:44:27.065 --> 00:44:28.097
I'm on it.

00:44:29.434 --> 00:44:31.668
There's a problem.
They need us at the warehouse.

00:44:32.437 --> 00:44:35.738
The other crime scene?

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.620
That's the problem.
It doesn't appear to be a crime scene.

00:46:12.971 --> 00:46:14.003
Come on.

00:46:24.182 --> 00:46:25.281
Damn it!

00:46:37.495 --> 00:46:39.529
Lori is 16,
and she can do whatever she wants.

00:46:39.531 --> 00:46:42.131
She is not you.
Well, you're not Mom.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.290
I don't want to
stay here alone.

00:46:57.048 --> 00:46:58.247
Stay with me.

00:47:04.088 --> 00:47:05.454
Hey, hey, hey.

00:47:08.126 --> 00:47:09.126
Not here.

00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:11.894
Not gonna die here.

00:47:36.955 --> 00:47:39.222
Come on. Come on.

00:48:12.991 --> 00:48:15.524
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Hello?

00:48:15.526 --> 00:48:17.326
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:48:17.328 --> 00:48:20.429
You need to help me, please.
There are two men chasing me.

00:48:23.902 --> 00:48:25.434
Wait. No. Shush!

00:48:25.436 --> 00:48:28.104
Shh! Please. I need help.

00:48:50.161 --> 00:48:51.594
Help!

00:48:51.596 --> 00:48:54.330
Security! The <i>señorita.</i>

00:49:03.174 --> 00:49:06.042
The girl! Over there!
Okay, thank you.

00:49:06.044 --> 00:49:07.076
Okay. Thank you.

00:49:54.392 --> 00:49:56.292
- This one's locked.
- They're all locked.

00:50:19.384 --> 00:50:20.583
What the hell?

00:50:50.715 --> 00:50:53.282
Goddamn.
How'd she open that?

00:50:53.284 --> 00:50:55.351
It doesn't matter.
It's a service elevator.

00:50:55.353 --> 00:50:57.119
It only goes down
to one floor.

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:00.290
Come on.

00:51:18.476 --> 00:51:21.310
Patience. CSS is packing up.
We'll get him while he's alone.

00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:31.120
But just in case.

00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:41.430
What the hell?
You guys are packing up?

00:51:41.432 --> 00:51:44.633
Yes, we are. There's no
crime scene here, Steve.

00:51:44.635 --> 00:51:46.569
No crime scene?
Yep.

00:51:46.571 --> 00:51:49.438
I saw the body myself.
I'm not saying there wasn't a crime.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.807
There's just no scene.

00:51:51.809 --> 00:51:54.143
Look, K-9 says
there was drugs.

00:51:54.145 --> 00:51:57.513
There's not even enough trace to
tell us what kind. Latents? None.

00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:00.716
Your victim was about here,
right?

00:52:00.718 --> 00:52:02.852
Right? Right here. Okay.

00:52:02.854 --> 00:52:04.820
Yeah, I saw him.
Right here.

00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:06.856
Okay.
Right here!

00:52:06.858 --> 00:52:08.824
So luminol
showed blood here,

00:52:08.826 --> 00:52:11.227
trace amounts,
and decreasing.

00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:12.661
Decreasing?
Yep.

00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:14.830
Somebody cleaned up
with hydrogen peroxide.

00:52:14.832 --> 00:52:18.367
It degrades the hemoglobin to a
point that luminol can't pick it up.

00:52:18.369 --> 00:52:20.903
And here...

00:52:20.905 --> 00:52:23.372
We saw this when we were
black-lighting the luminol.

00:52:23.374 --> 00:52:26.775
Bills marked with
UV ink injection violet.

00:52:26.777 --> 00:52:28.744
Nearly $200,000?

00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:30.613
One hundred and eighty-two.

00:52:32.183 --> 00:52:33.249
Is it yours?

00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:37.653
Yeah.
Jimmy Gonzo was my snitch.

00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:40.589
Given me seven busts.

00:52:41.692 --> 00:52:44.927
We hit a wall.
Deals got canceled.

00:52:44.929 --> 00:52:48.631
Jimmy said there was a
protection racket going around.

00:52:48.633 --> 00:52:50.566
Did you hear about any of that?

00:52:50.568 --> 00:52:53.836
So I had some guys plant
some traceable cash.

00:52:53.838 --> 00:52:56.872
Next thing I know,
he thinks he's been made.

00:52:56.874 --> 00:52:58.507
Sounds like he was right.

00:52:58.509 --> 00:53:00.342
Whoever's running the racket
killed him.

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.947
We're talking someone
who can take busts...

00:53:06.851 --> 00:53:08.617
and spot marked money.

00:53:08.619 --> 00:53:10.519
You're saying a cop
did this?

00:53:12.223 --> 00:53:13.856
Not "cop."

00:53:13.858 --> 00:53:15.858
Cops. More than one.

00:54:10.781 --> 00:54:13.716
Miss!
What are you doing here?

00:54:15.786 --> 00:54:18.420
They're trying to kill me.
You've got to get me out of here.

00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:20.756
Calm down.
This is a service floor.

00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:22.992
Okay.
It's off limits to patients.

00:54:22.994 --> 00:54:25.794
I'm not a patient. I mean, I am.
But they've locked down the elevators.

00:54:25.796 --> 00:54:26.996
You've gotta get me out.

00:54:31.402 --> 00:54:33.936
Front desk,
this is Officer Carroll.

00:54:33.938 --> 00:54:36.772
I'm gonna need some backup.
I've, uh... I've got the patient.

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.092
She took his damn keys.

00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:49.598
The memory card.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.067
I lost
the goddamn memory card.

00:57:53.904 --> 00:57:55.637
What the hell
are we gonna do now?

00:57:57.541 --> 00:57:59.208
It's time to
take it up a notch.

00:58:04.215 --> 00:58:06.615
<i>Attention all staff.</i>

00:58:06.617 --> 00:58:09.184
<i>Escaped patient
on quarantine floor.</i>

00:58:09.186 --> 00:58:12.254
<i>Please report to Security
as soon as possible.</i>

00:58:28.873 --> 00:58:30.873
Hello? Anyone here?

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:27.330
Maddie.

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:33.275
<i>Just a minute.</i>

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:35.911
<i>Who is it?</i>

01:03:35.913 --> 01:03:38.079
<i>Talk about the damn money.</i>

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:44.486
<i>What's up, man?</i>

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:47.022
<i>I don't know. You tell us.
Is there a problem?</i>

01:03:47.024 --> 01:03:49.524
<i>A problem?
Who's your contact?</i>

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:51.993
<i>Don't have a contact.
Who's stringing you?</i>

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.528
<i>What are you
talking about?</i>

01:03:55.532 --> 01:03:58.099
<i>You know, you're a fucking idiot.
You know that?</i>

01:03:58.101 --> 01:04:00.035
<i>We're cops.</i>

01:04:00.037 --> 01:04:03.505
<i>Do you really think that we
wouldn't notice marked bills?</i>

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:05.440
<i>I don't have
any marked bills.</i>

01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:10.405
<i>Hey, man, I thought we were friends.</i>

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:13.081
<i>Hey, hey, man, I'm sorry.</i>

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.292
<i>Got to be somewhere.</i>

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:26.161
<i>We'll find it, man.
We'll find it.</i>

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:28.430
Come on.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.466
Come on.

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:35.938
Okay.

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:50.585
- Wakes, Major Crimes.
- Lieutenant, listen to me.

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:53.421
The guys that are chasing me,
they're the shooters.

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:56.458
Madison?
Madison, are you okay?

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.394
Where are you now?
Are you safe?

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:02.597
Listen. You have to listen to me.
They're cops.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:05.467
I know, I know.
I just don't know who.

01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:09.170
O-Okay. Their names are, uh, Tull.
Tull and Pierce.

01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:10.939
<i>Of course. From Vice.</i>

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:13.174
Wait. How do you know?

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:15.243
Because they're here,
and they're chasing after me.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.479
Madison, listen to me.
Where are you?

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.347
Uh, I... I'm in the morgue.

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:20.916
<i>What? The morgue?</i>

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.417
Just stay there!

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.519
Just stay there, Madison.
I'm on my way.

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:26.087
I have to get my sister.

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:28.657
Listen, don't worry.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.159
<i>Just stay there, Madison.</i>

01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:32.193
Emily.

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:33.962
<i>Madison?</i>

01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:36.598
Emily.
<i>Madison!</i>

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.933
Jesus.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:39.567
<i>Maddie!</i>

01:05:42.406 --> 01:05:44.239
Madison!

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:33.154
Williams, Vice.

01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:37.592
Yeah.
I guess that makes you...

01:06:38.562 --> 01:06:39.995
the other partner.

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:43.598
Leech.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.534
The whole goddamn department
must be in on it.

01:06:50.107 --> 01:06:52.674
Hundred bucks says
there's a gallon in the trunk.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:56.077
Along with Jimmy's body.

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:12.260
I need units at Midtown General.
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:14.362
Code Three.
Repeat, Code Three.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.165
<i>Copy.
We'll have units proceed to the location.</i>

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:18.800
<i>Ten minutes ETA. Over.</i>

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:20.235
Ten minutes?

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:50.532
She's here. I know it.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:53.601
<i>Perfect. Put her on.</i>

01:07:55.806 --> 01:07:57.205
<i>Madison?</i>

01:07:58.475 --> 01:07:59.741
<i>Madison.</i>

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:05.613
I have someone here who, um,

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:07.115
wants to say hello.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.591
Maddie,
why are the police here?

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:22.097
It's real simple, Maddie.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:25.467
Come on out,
and I'll let her go.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:30.839
<i>Madison,
this is your last chance.</i>

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:35.110
<i>Don't make this harder
than it already is.</i>

01:08:37.114 --> 01:08:39.114
<i>Maddie.</i>

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.269
Now you can't run.

01:09:16.219 --> 01:09:17.752
It's okay.

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:19.454
Everything is just fine.

01:09:28.498 --> 01:09:29.564
<i>Madison?</i>

01:09:41.478 --> 01:09:44.512
We're keeping
her body alive, but...

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:45.947
but it's just her body.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.317
How, uh... How long?

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:54.389
Your parents' insurance
only covers 30 days

01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:56.424
of life support
in these situations.

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:59.260
But you're gonna have to
make a decision soon.

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:07.202
I'm so sorry, Madison.

01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:12.941
Did you ask him,
Maddie?

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:16.978
Did you ask him
if she's gonna wake up?

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:32.360
Wake up.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.830
Maddie, wake up.

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:39.634
Wake up!

01:10:44.808 --> 01:10:46.374
I think that one worked.

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:54.582
What do you want from me?

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:57.285
Well, at first we wanted
that bullet out of your leg.

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:02.423
But, you see,
my partner here, the genius,

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.593
he shot you with his service gun,
and he's a cop.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.595
Which means his ballistics
are in the system,

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.631
which puts us
at the scene of the crime.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:16.671
We really need to know,
where did you put that video card?

01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:19.474
- If you touch my sister...
- Shh. Stop.

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:21.776
You are in no position
to make any threats.

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:25.713
I've already called the cops.
They're on their way.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.649
You mean your buddy,
Wakes?

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:30.785
He ain't coming
to save you.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:34.355
There's no one coming.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:36.491
It's just you and us.

01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:39.794
Come on, Madison.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:44.299
Tell us where the card is,
and I promise I'll make this quick.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:47.502
It'll only hurt a little bit.
Scout's honor.

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.737
Fuck you.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.907
Still need to
get that bullet out.

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:54.942
Why don't we start
by digging?

01:11:57.047 --> 01:11:58.613
Wait.

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:01.049
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:04.319
If you do that, we're not gonna be able
to find it. She's gonna bleed out.

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:10.358
Madison, I have to say I'm very,
very disappointed in you.

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:14.362
But maybe
I should go get your sister.

01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:16.898
Maybe that will speed the
process up a little bit.

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:19.934
I'll be right back.

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:21.969
Let's play around with these again.

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:24.472
<i>Sterilizing now.
Stand clear.</i>

01:12:37.954 --> 01:12:40.421
Doctor, where's that girl
I brought in earlier?

01:12:40.423 --> 01:12:42.657
- The shooter?
- What? Not...

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:44.959
No. No, no.
The girl, Madison.

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:48.830
The other cops are searching for her now.
They said she was the shooting suspect.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.998
Security had to close off
most of the floors.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.469
- Close off what?
- All of it. Come with me.

01:12:59.476 --> 01:13:02.410
- How does that jolt your memory?
- I barely felt it.

01:13:03.747 --> 01:13:07.448
Really?
Now you want to play?

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:10.585
Let's turn this up to a thousand.

01:13:12.822 --> 01:13:14.756
<i>Pierce. Pierce, pick up.</i>

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:17.425
What?

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:20.962
Stop it. Leave her alone.
That's an order.

01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:23.898
Damn it.
I had the information almost from her.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.900
Give me a second.

01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:29.670
<i>I haven't heard
from Williams and Marcos.</i>

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:32.673
Wakes is onto us.
You need to get out of there. Now.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.510
All right.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.147
Oh, shit!

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:46.821
<i>Analyzing now.</i>

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:49.991
<i>Check for pulse.</i>

01:13:55.098 --> 01:13:56.664
Pierce.

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:58.534
<i>Pierce?</i>

01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:02.970
I'm on my way.

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:06.007
Shit.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:09.477
My sister's okay, right?

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.017
What's gonna happen to her?

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:18.986
Why don't we, um...

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:21.622
go find out together?

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.114
I'm not gonna hurt you
though.

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:36.772
Let's go.

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:02.997
Come on.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:05.633
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:08.102
Stop that.

01:15:16.613 --> 01:15:19.847
Let her go, asshole.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:23.951
- Stevie.
- I should've fucking known.

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:26.687
You were always
a shitty cop.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:30.258
Oh. Now, you're no fun.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:34.695
You just had to go the officer route,
leave us poor grunts behind.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.731
You give grunts a bad name.

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:40.268
How is that shoulder,
by the way?

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:42.236
I'd be happy
to snap it again.

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:44.305
It's been 20 years.

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:46.874
You think
you can handle it now?

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.710
Let the kid go first.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:54.248
Go.

01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:39.060
Maddie. Maddie!

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:54.875
It's okay. Honey. No, no, no.
It's okay. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

01:16:54.877 --> 01:16:57.144
Listen to me.
We have to get out of here, okay?

01:16:57.146 --> 01:16:58.946
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

01:17:40.957 --> 01:17:42.323
Madison.

01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:53.701
Are you...
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.016
Quick, quick.
Go, go, go. Go!

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:18.893
Honey. Go. Go.

01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:19.927
Go, Emmy.

01:18:21.731 --> 01:18:23.197
Go. Emmy, you go.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:54.962
I'm gonna kill your little sister first,
bitch.

01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:58.833
It'll be the last thing you see
before I cut your eyes out.

01:18:58.835 --> 01:19:01.135
Come on, Maddie. Get up.

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:02.137
Get up.

01:19:03.372 --> 01:19:06.207
You ain't running no more.
Come on!

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:08.175
I got your sister.
What are you gonna do?

01:19:09.112 --> 01:19:10.112
Get up.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080
Get up!

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:20.454
Put her down.

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:23.858
Or what?
Are you gonna shoot?

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:26.927
Have you ever fired
a weapon before, Maddie?

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:30.131
Don't worry, Emily.
It's all gonna be over quick.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:33.167
Emmy.

01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:34.335
Maddie. Maddie.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:36.371
Emily.

01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:39.507
Maddie.

01:19:39.509 --> 01:19:41.809
Come on. Come on.

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:08.435
Shh. It's okay.

01:20:08.437 --> 01:20:11.038
Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.
You're safe. It's okay.

01:20:13.543 --> 01:20:15.176
Shh.

01:20:19.182 --> 01:20:21.515
It's okay. It's okay.

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:24.985
Just breathe. It's okay.

01:20:33.396 --> 01:20:35.029
I told you you'd make it.

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:44.439
You okay?

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:58.352
What's this?

01:20:58.354 --> 01:20:59.854
Your evidence.

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:03.057
Thanks for coming back.

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:10.998
You're gonna be all right.

01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:13.601
You're gonna be all right.

01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:18.472
Behave yourselves.

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:21.041
I'll be back
with some help.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:26.146
It's okay. You're safe now.
It's okay.
