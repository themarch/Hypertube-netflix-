[screaming]

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.150
[Mike] Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.820
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.860
- It is almost here.
- What is it?

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.280
What if it's the Demogorgon?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.410
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.530
It's not the Demogorgon.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.870
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.080
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya. [chuckling]

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.960
- [snorts]
- [all chuckling]

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.960
[softly] Wait a minute.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.590
Did you hear that?

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.090
That... that sound?

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.840
Boom... boom...

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.680
- [yells] Boom!
- [slams table]

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.696
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.390
That came from something else.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.850
- The Demogorgon!
- [all groaning]

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.456
- We're in deep shit.
- Will, your action!

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.770
- I don't know!
- Fireball him!

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.150
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.070
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.690
- Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
- Cast Protection.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.490
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.360
It stomps towards you.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.450
- Boom!
- Fireball him!

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.830
- Another stomp, boom!
- Cast Protection.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.750
- He roars in anger!
- [all clamoring]

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.330
- Fireball!
- [die clattering]

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.040
- Oh, shit!
- [Lucas] Where'd it go?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.830
[Lucas] Where is it?
[Will] I don't know!

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.460
- Is it a 13?
- [Will] I don't know!

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.776
[Lucas] Where is it?
[Dustin] Oh, my God!

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.436
[Karen] Mike!
[Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.606
[Karen] Mike!
[Lucas] Can you find it yet?

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.720
[Will] No, I can't find it!

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.470
- Mike!
- [Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.340
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.550
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.810
[Lucas] Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
[Will] Why do we have to go?

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.600
- Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
- It's a school night, Michael.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.150
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.830
- But that'll ruin the flow!
- Michael...

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.110
I'm serious, Mom.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.650
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.716
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.610
You've been playing for ten hours?

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.740
- Dad, don't you think that 20 more...
- I think you should listen to your mother.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.290
- [static crackling on TV]
- [grunts] Dang dumb piece of junk.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.290
[Will] Oh, I got it!

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.250
- Does the seven count?
- It was a seven?

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.460
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.260
[Dustin] Yo, hey, guys.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.220
- Does anyone want this?
- [both] No.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.850
[Nancy] Yeah.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.230
No, I don't think...

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.940
Yeah, he's cute.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.360
Barb, no, I don't think so.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.900
- Barb, you're not...
- Hey, Nancy.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.216
There's a slice left if you want it.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.580
- Sausage and pepperoni!
- Hold on.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.380
- There's something wrong with your sister.
- What are you talking about?

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.316
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- [Lucas] Yeah.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.860
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.720
[Dustin] Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.090
She's always been a real jerk.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.050
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.576
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.810
[Mike] Four years ago!

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.350
[Dustin] Just saying.
[Lucas] Later.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.980
- It was a seven.
- Huh?

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.810
The roll, it was a seven.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.110
The Demogorgon, it got me.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.150
[grunts] See you tomorrow.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.840
[Lucas] Good night, ladies.
[Dustin] Kiss your mom 'night for me.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.260
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.010
- Any comic?
- Yeah.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.010
[Dustin] Hey! Hey!

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.060
I didn't say "go"!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.150
Get back here!

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.360
I'm gonna kill you!

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.860
[Will] I'll take your <i>X-Men 134!</i>

- Check the couch!

Ugh, I did.

Oh... Got them.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.840
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

- Yeah, see you later.
- Where's Will?

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.970
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.196
- He's probably still sleeping.
- [sighs]

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.350
- Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
- Mom, I'm making breakfast.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.270
I told you this a thousand times.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.980
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.740
- He came home last night, right?
- He's not in his room?

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.120
- Did he come home or not?
- I don't know.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.450
- You don't know?
- No.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.580
[stammering] I got home late.
I was working.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.700
You were working?

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.710
Eric asked if I could cover.
I said yeah.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.306
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.040
- Jonathan, we've talked about this.
- I know, I know.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.050
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.356
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.050
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- [sighs] I can't believe you.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.720
I can't believe you sometimes.

- [phone ringing]
- That's disgusting.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.560
- [Mike] You're disgusting!
- Hello?

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.400
Hi, Karen.
It's Joyce.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.520
- [Karen] Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:12.780
- [Ted] Hey!
- Quiet!

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.570
- Language.
- Are you kidding?

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.030
Was that Will I heard back there?

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.610
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.110
Will didn't spend the night?

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.620
[Karen] <i>No, he left here</i>
<i>a little bit after 8:00.</i>

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.040
Why? He's not home?

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.960
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.040
- Thank you so much. Bye.
<i>- Okay. Bye.</i>

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.390
[school bell ringing]

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.900
That's weird.
I don't see him.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.586
[Lucas] I'm telling you, his mom's right.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.440
He probably just
went to class early again.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.086
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.030
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.370
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.080
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.750
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.010
[sighs]

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.340
[mimicking Dustin]
I'd go with Toothless.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.890
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.720
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.810
[mimicking Dustin]
"I told you a million times."

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.930
- [chuckles]
- Do the arm thing.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.060
Do it, freak!

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.320
- [bones cracking]
- [both groaning]

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.650
[Troy] God, it gets me every time.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.820
- Assholes.
- [Mike] I think it's kinda cool.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.080
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.040
Like Mr. Fantastic.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.370
[Dustin] Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.460
[bell ringing]

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.510
[Barbara] So, did he call?

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.140
Keep your voice down.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.800
Did he?

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.640
I told you, it's not like that.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.980
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:12.980
We just...

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.610
made out a couple times.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.070
"We just... made out a couple times."

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.490
Nance, seriously,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.650
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.160
No, I'm not.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.910
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.790
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol...

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.160
Oh, that's gross!

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.420
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.340
- Two-time thing.
- [chuckles]

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.470
You were saying?

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.350
- Steve...
- Mmm-hmm?

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.110
- I have to go.
- In a minute.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.480
[bell ringing]

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.860
Steve.
I really, like...

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.780
Seriously, I have to go.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.240
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.200
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.200
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.540
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.330
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.580
- Well, then, just let me help.
- You failed chem.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.670
- C-minus.
- Well, in that case...

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.090
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.130
- Are you crazy? My mom would not...
- I'll climb through your window.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.446
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.720
You are crazy.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.696
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.010
We can just...

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.020
We can just, like, chill in my car.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.060
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.560
Steve... I have to study.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.360
I'm not kidding.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.730
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.490
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.120
[sighs]

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.040
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.250
To study.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.420
[bell ringing]

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.760
Good of you to show.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.520
[Hopper slurring] Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.270
- Hey, Chief.
- Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.416
- Oh, yeah?
- [chuckles] Yeah.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.040
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.070
[officers laughing]

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.690
While you were drinking or sleeping,

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.740
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.820
Phil Larson called.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.580
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.120
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.460
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.080
On a more pressing matter,

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.210
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.050
[muffled] Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.340
- Just give me a minute.
- Joyce is very upset.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.300
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.720
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.680
- Chief, she's already in your...
- Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.940
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.610
[sighs deeply] And I apologize again.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.070
I'm going out of my mind!

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.740
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.830
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.516
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well, you never know.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.306
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.976
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.670
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.710
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.300
He's not like... most.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.260
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.180
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.310
- They laugh at him, his clothes...
- His clothes?

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.350
- What's wrong with his clothes?
- I don't know.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.730
- Does that matter?
- Maybe.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.860
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.650
Lonnie... [sighs]
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.070
[softy] Called him a fag.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.070
- Is he?
- He's missing is what he is.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.950
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.080
[scoffs]

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.420
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.316
- But he has nothing to do with this.
- Why don't you give me his number?

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.276
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.510
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.720
the kid is with a parent or relative.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.310
[stammers] What about the other time?

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.730
- What?
- You said, "99 out of 100."

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.850
- What about the other time, the one?
- Joyce.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.060
The one!

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.980
- Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
- [sighs]

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.876
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.046
in the four years I've been working here?

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.296
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.450
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.250
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.990
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.790
He will talk to me before he talks to...

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.830
- What, a pig?
- A cop!

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.920
[voice breaking] Just find my son, Hop.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.880
Find him!

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.640
[man] Dr. Brenner.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.270
[scientist] This way, gentlemen.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.190
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.110
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.950
[air hissing]

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.170
[guns cocking]

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.930
[elevator humming]

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.060
[elevator thuds]

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.980
[squelching]

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.660
[low growling]

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.540
[indistinct growling]

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.930
[man 1] This is where it came from?
[man 2] Yes.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.010
[man 1] And the girl?

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.760
She can't have gone far.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.600
[growls]

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.430
[music playing faintly]

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.740
[Ben] All right, and one more.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.676
[man] Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.240
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.660
[man] I don't know,
37 points per game average...

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.620
[Ben] Thirty-seven now, but...
[man] Mr. Basket.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.060
[indistinct chatter]

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.110
Hey!

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.320
Come here!

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.360
Hey, come here!

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.080
You think you can steal from me, boy?

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.750
What in the hell?

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.130
- [bell ringing]
- [Mr. Clarke] Remember, finish chapter 12

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.010
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.220
and other forms of science investigation.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:07.180
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.310
[trailing off] It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.350
So, did it come?

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.810
Sorry, boys.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.770
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.980
it came.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.490
Yes!

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.360
The Heathkit ham shack.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.966
[Mike] Whoa.
[Mr. Clarke] Ain't she a beaut?

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.030
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.290
Think bigger.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.370
- California?
- Bigger.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.830
Australia?

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.370
- [boys exclaiming]
- [Lucas] Oh, man!

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.340
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.500
Lucas!

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.960
- Sorry.
- [Dustin chuckles]

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.420
[radio tuning]

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.930
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.720
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.470
[Lucas] What are you doing?

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.786
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Dustin,

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.810
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.060
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.150
- [Mike laughs]
- [knock on door]

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:06.070
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.820
[overlapping chatter]

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.620
Okay, okay, okay.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.660
One at a time, all right?
You.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.380
- You said he takes what?
- Mirkwood.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.040
- Mirkwood?
- Yeah.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.630
- Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
- I have not. That sounds made up to me.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:26.510
No, it's from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.470
- Well, <i>The Hobbit.</i>
- It doesn't matter.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.390
- He asked!
- [mockingly] "He asked!"

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.060
- [Mike] Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.100
- What'd I just say?
- Shut up.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.480
One at a damn time.
You.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.770
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.296
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.876
- Yeah, all right, I think I know that...
- We can show you, if you want.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.240
I said that I know it!

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.240
- We can help look.
- Yeah.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.240
- No.
- [boys clamoring]

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.450
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.750
Immediately.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.620
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:00.790
no nonsense.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.840
This isn't some <i>Lord of the Rings</i> book.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.710
<i>- The Hobbit.</i>
- Shut up!

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.170
- Hey!
- [Mike] Stop it!

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.380
[boys bickering]

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.390
[softly] Do I make myself clear?

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.150
Do I make myself... clear?

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.940
[Mike and Dustin] Yes, sir.
[Lucas] Yeah.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.490
Ring-a-ding-ding!

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.290
Anybody home?

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.000
[Will] Password?

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.040
Uh, Rada...

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.880
[stammering] Radaga... Radagast?

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.380
[Will] Yeah. You may enter.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.930
[Joyce] Thank you, sir.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.550
So, guess what?

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.100
I got off early and...

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.850
Ta-da!
<i>Poltergeist.</i>

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.536
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.940
I changed my mind.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.860
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.400
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.490
Oh, yeah?

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.240
Not even of clowns?

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.400
No.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.870
What about my witch?

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.370
- No. Mom...
- Ooh...

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.290
- I'm not five anymore.
- But Will Byers...

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.970
- I'm going to cook you up in my...
- Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.120
[sighs]

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.290
[Jonathan] Will?

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.960
- [shouting] Will?
- Will?

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.760
Will?

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.300
- Will?
- Will!

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.100
- [Jonathan] Will!
- Will?

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.720
[Joyce] Will!

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.480
Where are you?

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.070
Geez.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.700
Your parents forget to feed you?

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.200
Is that why you ran away?

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.870
They, uh...

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.040
They hurt you?

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.630
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.390
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.640
All right.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.850
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.960
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.380
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.440
We got a deal?

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.070
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.530
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.330
See? Like this. Here.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.330
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.880
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.000
[sighing]

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.260
[sighs]

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.260
Eleven?

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.600
What's that mean?

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.220
What's it mean?

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.560
- No.
- Well, I'll be damned.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.350
She speaks.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.110
"No"? No, what?

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.900
[clicks tongue] All right.
I guess no more food, then.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.150
Eleven.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.570
Yeah.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:20.450
What's it mean?

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.620
Eleven.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.500
All right, then.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.330
[chuckles] Here you go.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.170
Take it easy, take it easy.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.460
[sighs]

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.170
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.380
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.090
kidnapped or something.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.180
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:48.730
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.610
[fan rattling]

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.490
[rattling continues]

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.450
[rattling intensifies]

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.380
[Callahan] Will Byers?

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.550
[Powell yelling] Will!

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.060
[Callahan] Will Byers?

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.680
[hooting]

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.060
Come on, kid!

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.400
[Powell] Will?

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.320
- [Powell whistles]
- Hey! I got something.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.290
- That his bike?
- Yeah, he must have crashed.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.340
[Callahan] You think
he got hurt in the fall?

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.620
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.630
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.340
He would've walked it home.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.430
[static]

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.220
[radio frequencies tuning]

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.366
[woman 1] <i>...get off work if I win.</i>

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.060
[woman 2] <i>Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...</i>

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.996
[woman 3] <i>...but we will cover</i>
<i>whatever the damages are to your property.</i>

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.746
<i>- It's just, um...</i>
- [woman 4] <i>That's for sure.</i>

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.400
- [overlapping conversations]
- [line ringing]

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.200
[Joyce] <i>Is Lonnie there?</i>

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.636
[woman] <i>Lonnie isn't here right now.</i>
[Joyce] <i>Can you please...</i>

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.540
<i>- I told you, Lonnie's not here.</i>
- Who is this?

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.620
<i>- His girlfriend, Cynthia.</i>
- Cynthia.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.420
<i>- Who the hell is this?</i>
- Cynthia, this is Joyce.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.250
<i>- Who?</i>
- Lonnie's ex-wife.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.436
- I really need to speak to him...
<i>- Lonnie's not here.</i>

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.396
- Can you please put... No!
<i>- Why don't you call back later?</i>

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.630
No, not later. Now!

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.880
- Can...
- [line disconnects]

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:43.380
- Bitch!
- [Jonathan] Mom.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.930
- What?
- You have to stay calm.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.350
[chuckles]

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.430
[Joyce muttering]

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.600
[phone ringing]

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:55.786
[Lonnie] <i>Hey, you've reached Lonnie.</i>

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.020
<i>Leave a message
and I'll holler right back at ya.</i>

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.860
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.450
Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.700
[voice breaking] I need...

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.370
I just need you to call me back,
please, just...

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.950
- [answering machine beeps]
- [line disconnects]

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.790
- Damn it! Damn it!
- [car approaching]

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.540
- [sighs deeply]
- Mom?

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.630
What?

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:18.840
Cops.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.230
- It was just lying there?
- Yeah. Cal?

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.820
- Did it have any blood on it, or...
- No, no, no, no, no...

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.400
Phil?

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.910
If you found the bike out there,
why are you here?

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.830
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- [Jonathan] Yeah.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.250
So...

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.370
maybe he came home.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.500
[stammers] You think I didn't check
my own house?

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.380
I'm not saying that.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.050
- Has this always been here?
- [Joyce] What? I don't know.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.970
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:07.760
You're not sure?

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.930
- [Joyce sighs]
- [dog barking]

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:13.850
[barks]

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:20.730
Hey.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.110
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.700
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.010
[indistinct squelching]

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.310
[squelching stops]

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.320
- [Callahan] Hey!
- Jesus!

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.990
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.530
- [exhales]
- What's going on?

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.830
Hello?

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:59.000
- Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
- Listen, I want you to call Flo.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.476
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.630
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.000
[Callahan] Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.866
[Mike] We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:17.770
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says...

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.406
- I don't care what the chief said.
- Michael!

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:21.166
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:22.400
More reason to stay put.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.520
- Mom!
- End of discussion.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.660
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:35.160
- That's cool, right?
- No, not cool.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.490
What? Why not?

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.790
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.920
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.790
- This is such bullshit.
- Language.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.290
So we're under house arrest?

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.356
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.670
- Wait, this is Will's fault?
- Nancy, take that back.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.300
- No!
- You're just pissed off

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.340
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:57.220
- Steve?
- Who is Steve?

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.720
- Her new boyfriend.
- You are such a douchebag, Mike!

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:01.600
- Language!
- [groans]

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:04.690
Nancy, come back.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.770
Come back!

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.280
[sighs] It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:12.030
You see, Michael?

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.466
- You see what happens?
- [shouting] What happens when what?

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:18.080
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.200
That is really unfair, son.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.500
We care.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.290
[sighs]

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.170
- Mike!
- Let him go.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.300
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:35.590
What did I do?

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.510
Hey! What'd I do?

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.600
[boy] Will!
[man 1] Will Byers!

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:46.730
[man 2] Will!

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.650
[woman] Will, we're here for you, bud!

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.520
[volunteers shouting indistinctly]

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.740
[Mr. Clarke] He's a good student.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.240
- [Hopper] What?
- Will. He's a good student.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.950
Great one, actually.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.370
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.750
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.830
[Hopper] I always had
a distaste for science.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.880
[Mr. Clarke] Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.300
[Hopper] Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.010
[Mr. Clarke chuckles] Ratliff?
You bet.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.260
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.140
[Hopper] Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.260
Sarah, my daughter...

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.810
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.360
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.190
I never needed to look elsewhere.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:34.530
[Mr. Clarke] Your daughter,
what grade is she?

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:37.360
- Maybe I'll get her in my class.
- No, she, uh...

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.990
She lives with her mom in the city.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.540
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.620
- She died a few years back.
- Sorry?

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:49.960
His kid.

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:03.970
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.890
<i>- Lucas?</i>
- Hey, it's Lucas.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.980
I know it's you.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.230
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.940
I'm done. Over.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.440
I'm worried about Will. Over.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.570
[sighs] Yeah.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.320
This is crazy. Over.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.030
I was thinking...

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.370
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.460
He cast Fireball.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.290
<i>- Over.</i>
- What's your point? Over.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:37.090
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.050
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:40.260
<i>Over.</i>

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.470
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.356
[whispers] What are you doing here?

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.670
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.590
- I figured we'd just study here.
- No. No way.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.930
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.810
So just... bear with me.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.180
[window rattles]

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.850
What'd I tell you?

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.400
Ninja.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.020
[scoffs]

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.980
[hose running]

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:48.910
You like that ice cream, huh?

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.580
Smile looks good on you.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.000
You know, smile?

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.880

[knocking on door]

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.760
All right.
You just sit tight.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.220
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:13.100
- [knocking continues]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.730
- Hey, can I help you?
- Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.126
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.900
- So try back tomorrow morning.
- Connie Frazier. Social Services.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.860
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:27.780
- That's a heck of a drive.
- Not too bad this time of night.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.176
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.160
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.880
- Children I work with usually are.
- Right, right.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.300
- So, where is she?
- Right. She's in the kitchen.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.210
- Come on up. I'll introduce you.
- Thank you.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.100
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.276
- It's fine.
- You know, it's funny.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.860
- Your, uh, voice sounds different on the...
- [silenced gunshot]

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.060
Hey, guys.
You feel that?

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.770
- I think maybe we should go back.
- No.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.480
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:40.690
Come on.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.150
Just stay on channel six.
Don't do anything stupid.

[thunder rumbling]

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.160
Hey, guys, wait up.

Wait up!

[Steve] "Which polymers occur naturally?"

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.670
Starch and cellulose.

Wow.
Jesus, how many of these did you make?

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.390
You said you wanted to help.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.650
How about this? How about...

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.336
How about every time
that you get something right,

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.880
I have to take off
an item of clothing.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.586
But every time
that you get something wrong...

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:26.820
- Uh, pass.
- Oh, come on.

- Come on.
- No.

Ooh, it's boiling points.

That's what I meant.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.960
Yeah, that's not what you said.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.670
- No.
- No?

Do you need help, or...

No.

Are you crazy?
My parents are here.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.660
That's weird, I... don't see them.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:28.170
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.840
- get another notch on your belt.
- No. Nancy, no.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.050
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

You mean, you're not a slut.

That's not what I'm saying.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.470
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:40.230
Shut up.

Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

These are great.

I should've been there for him.

[hoarsely] No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:56.680
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.430
He is... close.
I know it. [stammers] I...

missing because he ran into something bad?

And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

- And we have no weapons or anything?
- Dustin, shut up.

does that seem smart to you?
