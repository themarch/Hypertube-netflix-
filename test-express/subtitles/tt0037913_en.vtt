00:01:56.913 --> 00:01:58.906
Mildred.

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.074
What's on your mind, lady?

00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:28.917
You know what I think? I think maybe
you had an idea you'd take a swim.

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.749
That's what I think.

00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:32.466
Leave me alone.

00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:36.299
If you take a swim, I'd have
to take a swim. Is that fair?

00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:39.140
You feel like bumping yourself off,
I gotta get pneumonia.

00:03:39.307 --> 00:03:44.183
Never thought about that, did you?
Okay. Think about it.

00:03:44.354 --> 00:03:46.014
Go on, beat it now.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.356
Go on home before we both take a swim.

00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:23.716
Mildred. What are you doing
around this pigeon perch? Slumming?

00:04:23.893 --> 00:04:25.803
- What?
- You sick or something?

00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:29.690
No. I don't think so.

00:04:29.858 --> 00:04:35.065
If you're feeling weak, come inside
and have a drink on the house. For free.

00:04:35.238 --> 00:04:36.981
Come on.

00:04:37.157 --> 00:04:40.490
You know, buying this joint was
the smartest move I ever made.

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:49.327
- Give us a couple drinks, will you, Tony?
- Yes, sir.

00:04:58.136 --> 00:05:02.216
I hope you're not sore at me about
this afternoon. Strictly business, see?

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.435
I mean, it might just as well have been you
selling me out. You can't expect-

00:05:07.854 --> 00:05:10.012
What are you looking
at me like that for?

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.309
You can talk your way out of anything.
You're good at that.

00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:16.439
In my business you have to be.

00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:21.524
Only right now, I'd rather talk myself
into something. Know what I mean?

00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:23.493
- Still trying?
- It's a habit.

00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:25.321
I've tried once a week
since we were kids.

00:05:25.497 --> 00:05:27.785
- Twice a week.
- Okay, twice.

00:05:27.957 --> 00:05:30.745
Anyhow, I'm still drawing blanks.

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.624
You never used to drink it
straight like that.

00:05:33.797 --> 00:05:37.794
I've learned how these last few months.
I've learned a lot of things.

00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:41.052
- Like, for instance?
- Like, for instance, that's rotten liquor.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.048
There's better stuff to drink
at the beach house, Wally.

00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:49.974
- Is that a dare?
- Could be.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.976
All right. I'll take it.

00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:57.274
You know I like good stuff.

00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:01.110
- Maybe this is my lucky day.
- Maybe.

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.376
- Come in.
- How about your husband?

00:06:15.547 --> 00:06:19.379
Is he getting broad-minded
all of a sudden?

00:06:22.178 --> 00:06:27.339
Monte isn't here. Besides, you can talk
your way out of anything, can't you?

00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:29.225
I get by all right.

00:06:29.394 --> 00:06:32.181
- You keep saying that.
- Do I?

00:06:35.358 --> 00:06:40.483
- Nervous, Wally?
- No, I'm cold. Temporarily.

00:06:43.366 --> 00:06:47.281
- Isn't this more comfortable?
- Yeah, I guess so, but....

00:06:47.454 --> 00:06:49.530
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

00:06:49.706 --> 00:06:52.541
- You don't seem very happy here.
- Oh, I'm happy. Believe me.

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:54.867
Inside, my heart is singing.

00:06:55.045 --> 00:07:00.086
- That's pretty corny, Wally.
- Well, I'm a corny guy, but I'm smart too.

00:07:02.802 --> 00:07:05.673
- I wonder about things.
- What things?

00:07:05.847 --> 00:07:08.136
Well, I wonder why
you brought me here tonight.

00:07:08.308 --> 00:07:13.978
I mean, all of a sudden, husband gone,
soft lights, quiet room, opportunity.

00:07:14.147 --> 00:07:17.931
- Why?
- Maybe I find you irresistible, Wally.

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:21.395
Yeah? You make me shiver, Mildred.
You always have.

00:07:21.571 --> 00:07:24.144
You make love so nicely, Wally.
You always have.

00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:29.829
You know, all my life when I've wanted
something, I've gone after it. I get it too.

00:07:29.996 --> 00:07:32.831
It may take me a little time, okay,
but I get what I want.

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:38.242
- Do you? It must be nice.
- Yeah. It is.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.376
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, what's the score?

00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:46.885
I feel sticky.
I think I'd better change my dress.

00:07:47.055 --> 00:07:49.094
Yeah, sure, Mildred.
It's a good idea.

00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:52.432
I'll only be a minute.

00:07:55.438 --> 00:07:58.558
- Leave the door open so we can talk.
- I like to hear you talk.

00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:04.688
Yeah? So do I. Something about the sound
of my own voice that fascinates me.

00:08:04.864 --> 00:08:08.364
I'm glad you didn't get sore,
the way I took you over the hurdles.

00:08:08.535 --> 00:08:13.909
I didn't mean to cut up your business the
way I did. I got started and couldn't stop.

00:08:14.082 --> 00:08:18.958
I see an angle, I start cutting myself
a piece of throat. It's an instinct.

00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:22.829
With me, being smart's a disease.
Know what I mean?

00:08:24.217 --> 00:08:25.842
Hm?

00:08:27.804 --> 00:08:29.464
Hey, Mildred!

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:32.308
Hurry up!
You know I don't like to drink alone.

00:08:32.475 --> 00:08:37.303
Hey. Say something. This one-sided
conversation is beginning to bore me.

00:08:45.238 --> 00:08:47.112
Huh?

00:08:51.328 --> 00:08:53.700
Hey, Mildred.

00:08:54.914 --> 00:08:56.539
Mildred.

00:08:57.625 --> 00:08:59.417
Come on, Mildred, don't play games.

00:08:59.586 --> 00:09:05.042
I'm a nice guy up to a certain point,
but don't get me sore. Mildred.

00:09:18.104 --> 00:09:19.682
Hey.

00:09:19.856 --> 00:09:21.683
What's the matter?

00:09:21.858 --> 00:09:24.693
What kind of business is this, anyway?

00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:31.359
Mildred!

00:09:36.873 --> 00:09:38.913
Mildred!

00:10:55.535 --> 00:10:57.943
Hit that house with the light.

00:11:03.293 --> 00:11:06.045
Hey, stop, you!

00:11:06.212 --> 00:11:07.956
Okay, okay.

00:11:13.219 --> 00:11:15.093
What's the hurry, pal?

00:11:15.263 --> 00:11:17.754
- No gun.
- Better take a look in that house.

00:11:17.932 --> 00:11:21.633
This guy came through that window
like he was shot out of a cannon.

00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:25.434
- Get that from the window?
- No, I cut myself shaving.

00:11:25.607 --> 00:11:28.145
Get going, smart guy.
You need some fixing.

00:11:28.318 --> 00:11:31.070
Oh, brother.
I'm so smart, it's a disease.

00:11:31.237 --> 00:11:33.313
All right, go ahead.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.868
What were you doing in there, pal?
Picking up souvenirs?

00:11:39.037 --> 00:11:42.157
No, pal. Nothing petty.
This is a pretty big night for you.

00:11:42.332 --> 00:11:44.408
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Lots of excitement.

00:11:44.584 --> 00:11:46.209
There's a stiff in there.

00:11:46.378 --> 00:11:47.836
Is that so?

00:11:48.004 --> 00:11:51.919
And I suppose you were running
right to the station to report it?

00:11:52.092 --> 00:11:54.665
He says there's a dead guy
in the house.

00:11:54.844 --> 00:11:58.344
- You never saw deader.
- Better call headquarters.

00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:03.638
Car 93 calling K-Q-V-B.

00:12:03.812 --> 00:12:06.433
Car 93 calling K-Q-V-B.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.295
Mother, where have you been?
They won't tell me anything.

00:12:30.463 --> 00:12:34.082
- Who won't tell you? Who's "they"?
- These men.

00:12:36.261 --> 00:12:39.215
Mrs. Beragon? We're from headquarters.

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:42.888
The inspector would like you
to have a little talk with him.

00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:45.052
- Why? What's the matter?
- I'm sorry.

00:12:45.228 --> 00:12:49.142
We only ask the questions. Besides,
we don't know what the trouble is.

00:12:49.315 --> 00:12:53.728
- It's probably something about the car.
- At this time of night?

00:12:55.655 --> 00:12:59.238
Whatever it is, I'll take care of it.
You're not to think about it at all.

00:12:59.409 --> 00:13:01.366
- Now, go to bed.
- Mother.

00:13:01.536 --> 00:13:03.410
Please, go on.

00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:10.332
- Can't you tell me what's happened?
- We'd better go.

00:13:18.053 --> 00:13:19.251
What's wrong?

00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:21.967
Didn't want to say anything
in front of her. It's your husband.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.007
- He's been murdered.
- Murdered?

00:14:04.599 --> 00:14:08.217
- Hi, Joe, what'd you get?
- This is Mrs. Pierce. I mean, Beragon.

00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:10.683
Which? Pierce or Beragon?
Make up your mind.

00:14:10.855 --> 00:14:14.900
- Mildred Pierce Beragon.
- Okay. Wheel her in.

00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:20.443
Right over there, please.

00:14:20.615 --> 00:14:23.071
Mrs. Beragon just came in.

00:14:23.243 --> 00:14:25.781
Sit down. He'll be right with you.

00:14:33.795 --> 00:14:36.167
Look. I bruise easy.

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:37.750
- Ida, what are you-?
- No talking.

00:14:40.927 --> 00:14:42.469
Yeah?

00:14:42.637 --> 00:14:44.511
Ida Corwin.

00:14:49.686 --> 00:14:54.099
- Well, what is this, a class reunion?
- Looks like it.

00:14:56.526 --> 00:14:58.815
I'll have a tough time
talking my way out of this.

00:14:58.987 --> 00:15:01.229
- Keep moving.
- All right, all right.

00:15:09.581 --> 00:15:11.657
Hi, Ed.

00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:15.167
- Charley, what's the good word?
- My feet hurt. That's the good word.

00:15:15.337 --> 00:15:18.503
You got me crying. How about a nice,
juicy item for the morning edition?

00:15:18.673 --> 00:15:21.591
- Nope. Not today.
- What's she in for?

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.879
Parking gum under her seat
in a movie. Satisfied?

00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:27.676
Okay, Charley. Okay.

00:15:34.439 --> 00:15:37.642
- I'm sorry, Mildred. I just couldn't help it.
- No talking.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.027
Take a seat.

00:15:44.741 --> 00:15:46.734
You know that guy?

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.579
Yes. We were married once.

00:15:59.172 --> 00:16:01.129
Paper, lady?

00:16:01.299 --> 00:16:03.208
No, thank you.

00:16:27.283 --> 00:16:29.110
Yeah?

00:16:29.285 --> 00:16:30.910
Okay.

00:16:32.372 --> 00:16:35.907
He wants you now.
Now you can talk.

00:16:46.052 --> 00:16:47.926
Inspector Peterson, Mrs. Beragon.

00:16:48.096 --> 00:16:50.005
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:52.174
Won't you sit down?

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:57.059
Sorry about your husband.
It must be a shock to you.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.139
Well, I....

00:17:00.191 --> 00:17:04.403
I'm afraid I don't quite know
how to begin.

00:17:05.488 --> 00:17:09.735
You see, the fact of the matter is,
Mrs. Beragon, we don't need you.

00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:11.154
You don't need me?

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:14.281
I don't know how to apologize for
bringing you down here for nothing.

00:17:14.456 --> 00:17:19.663
But, you understand, we had to be sure.
Well, now we are sure.

00:17:19.836 --> 00:17:22.920
Aren't you going to ask me questions?
I thought you would.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:27.798
I know. Everybody thinks detectives
do nothing but ask questions...

00:17:27.969 --> 00:17:31.883
...but detectives have souls,
the same as anyone else.

00:17:32.057 --> 00:17:35.176
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

00:17:35.352 --> 00:17:37.889
Go ahead. It's all right.

00:17:38.063 --> 00:17:43.104
Mrs. Beragon, being a detective is like,
well, like making an automobile.

00:17:43.276 --> 00:17:46.230
You take all the pieces
and put them together one by one.

00:17:46.404 --> 00:17:50.188
First thing you know, you got
an automobile. Or a murderer.

00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:51.446
And we got him.

00:17:51.618 --> 00:17:55.034
You're in the clear, Mrs. Beragon.
The case is on ice.

00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:57.032
Well, you can go now.

00:17:57.207 --> 00:17:59.034
All right, men.

00:18:01.378 --> 00:18:03.204
Could you-?

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.215
- Would you tell me who-?
- Who did it?

00:18:06.383 --> 00:18:08.921
Sure. You're entitled to know.

00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:21.094
No.

00:18:21.272 --> 00:18:22.767
No!

00:18:27.112 --> 00:18:29.235
Yes, he did it.

00:18:29.406 --> 00:18:33.818
- Your first husband. Pierce.
- No, Bert, I won't let you do this.

00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:36.070
Wally Fay.
How do you know he didn't do it?

00:18:36.246 --> 00:18:38.618
Fay had no motive. This man had.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.079
You see, we start out with nothing.

00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:44.501
Just a corpse,
if you'll pardon the expression.

00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:47.458
We look at the corpse and we say,
"Why? What was the reason?"

00:18:47.632 --> 00:18:52.424
And when we find the reason,
we find the man that made the corpse.

00:18:52.595 --> 00:18:55.549
In this case, him.

00:18:55.724 --> 00:18:57.597
Come on.

00:19:03.398 --> 00:19:07.561
- But he didn't do it. I know he didn't.
- Do you?

00:19:07.736 --> 00:19:10.440
The murder was committed with this.

00:19:10.613 --> 00:19:13.947
- Do you know who it belongs to?
- No. I don't know.

00:19:14.117 --> 00:19:17.533
We do. It belongs to Pierce.
That's fact number one.

00:19:17.704 --> 00:19:20.456
Fact number two:
He doesn't deny killing Beragon.

00:19:20.623 --> 00:19:24.158
He seems to think it was a good idea.
If there's one thing we know...

00:19:24.336 --> 00:19:30.125
...it's that an innocent man always
denies the crime, loud and often.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.423
Pierce doesn't.

00:19:32.594 --> 00:19:36.010
So do you blame us for feeling
fairly confident that he's the man...

00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:38.636
...who put four shots
out of six into Beragon?

00:19:38.808 --> 00:19:41.595
But he didn't. He couldn't.
He's too gentle and kind.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.439
Okay. He's kind and gentle.
He's wonderful.

00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:48.354
But if he's so wonderful, Mrs. Beragon,
why did you divorce him?

00:19:53.573 --> 00:19:55.779
Because I was wrong.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.363
It's taken me four years to find
that out, but now I know I was wrong.

00:20:00.538 --> 00:20:04.488
Let's see. Four years ago he was
in the real-estate business, wasn't he?

00:20:04.668 --> 00:20:09.294
Yes. He and Wally Fay were partners.
For a long time they made good money.

00:20:09.464 --> 00:20:13.414
They built a lot of houses.
Suddenly, everybody stopped buying.

00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:15.337
- The boom was over.
- Yes?

00:20:15.512 --> 00:20:19.461
Then one day they split up.
Wally was in and Bert was out.

00:20:19.641 --> 00:20:21.847
<i>They weren't partners anymore.</i>

00:20:22.018 --> 00:20:25.352
<i>That day when Bert came home,
he was out of a job.</i>

00:20:25.522 --> 00:20:28.476
- Here's the mail for you, Mr. Pierce.
- Thanks, Jack.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.101
- Have you got a change-of-address card?
- Why, yes.

00:20:32.278 --> 00:20:33.773
Thank you.

00:20:36.366 --> 00:20:39.651
<i>We lived on Corvalis Street
where all the houses looked alike.</i>

00:20:39.828 --> 00:20:42.319
<i>Ours was number 1143.</i>

00:20:42.497 --> 00:20:44.324
<i>I was always in the kitchen.</i>

00:20:44.499 --> 00:20:47.785
<i>I felt as though I'd lived
in a kitchen all my life...</i>

00:20:47.961 --> 00:20:51.128
<i>...except for the few hours
it took to get married.</i>

00:20:51.297 --> 00:20:54.002
- That you, Bert?
- Yeah. Who else?

00:20:54.175 --> 00:20:58.387
- I thought it might be Mrs. Whitley.
- Well, it isn't.

00:20:58.555 --> 00:21:02.220
<i>I married Bert when I was 17.
I never knew any other kind of life.</i>

00:21:02.392 --> 00:21:04.764
<i>Just cooking and washing
and having children.</i>

00:21:04.936 --> 00:21:07.308
<i>Two girls, Veda and Kay.</i>

00:21:12.986 --> 00:21:16.521
I pressed your pants. Though you might
want to see McLary about that job.

00:21:16.698 --> 00:21:20.149
It might be nice if you left me alone once
for just five minutes.

00:21:20.327 --> 00:21:22.118
When the time comes, I'll get a job.

00:21:22.287 --> 00:21:24.445
I know you will, Bert.
I was just trying to help.

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:32.671
Good afternoon.
Package from E. Langlin.

00:21:36.801 --> 00:21:39.043
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:21:40.221 --> 00:21:41.680
- What's that?
- A dress.

00:21:41.848 --> 00:21:43.259
- For Veda?
- Mm-hm.

00:21:43.433 --> 00:21:45.390
I thought so.
Where'd you get the money?

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.395
Making cakes and pies
for the neighbors. I earned it.

00:21:48.563 --> 00:21:51.766
Right, throw it up to me that
I can't support my own family.

00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:56.438
I don't say half as much as most women
would say with nothing but bills to pay.

00:21:56.613 --> 00:21:58.689
Keep it up. Maybe there'd be less bills...

00:21:58.865 --> 00:22:01.700
...if you didn't raise the kids
like I was a millionaire.

00:22:01.868 --> 00:22:04.786
No wonder they're so fresh
and stuck up. That Veda.

00:22:04.954 --> 00:22:09.451
I'm so fed up with her high-hatting me,
one of these days I'll slap her face.

00:22:09.626 --> 00:22:12.496
Bert, if you ever dare
touch Veda, I'll-

00:22:16.716 --> 00:22:19.124
All right. All right.

00:22:19.302 --> 00:22:22.303
Trouble is, you're trying
to buy love from them, and it won't work.

00:22:22.472 --> 00:22:25.508
I make enough to get by,
but no, that isn't good enough.

00:22:25.684 --> 00:22:27.972
Veda needs a piano, lessons
and fancy dresses...

00:22:28.144 --> 00:22:32.224
...so she can smirk her way through
a piece a talented 5-year-old could play.

00:22:32.399 --> 00:22:35.518
Veda has talent.
Just ask any of the neighbors.

00:22:35.694 --> 00:22:37.770
She plays the piano like I shoot pool.

00:22:37.946 --> 00:22:42.157
And Kay, a nice, normal kid who wants
to skip rope and play baseball.

00:22:42.325 --> 00:22:46.654
But she has ballet lessons. She has to
be a ballerina so you can feel proud.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.324
All right. What of it?

00:22:48.498 --> 00:22:50.989
What if I do want them
to amount to something?

00:22:51.167 --> 00:22:53.409
I'd do anything for those kids,
understand? Anything.

00:22:53.586 --> 00:22:57.169
- You can't do their crying for them.
- I'll do that too.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.674
- They'll never cry if I can help it.
- There's something wrong.

00:23:00.844 --> 00:23:03.928
I don't know what. I'm not smart
that way. But I know it isn't right to-

00:23:09.477 --> 00:23:11.434
<i>- Hello?
I just wanted to know if-</i>

00:23:11.604 --> 00:23:15.139
Yes? Yes, he is.

00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:17.854
<i>- Who's calling?
- Mrs. Biederhof.</i>

00:23:18.028 --> 00:23:20.316
Just a moment.

00:23:20.488 --> 00:23:23.692
It's for you. Mrs. Biederhof.

00:23:25.076 --> 00:23:27.401
Maggie, I can't talk now.
I told you not to-

00:23:27.579 --> 00:23:31.162
<i>- I tried to call you at the office.
- I can't talk to you now. Later.</i>

00:23:31.333 --> 00:23:33.658
So the noble Mr. Pierce
can't talk right now.

00:23:33.835 --> 00:23:36.504
He's busy telling his wife
what's wrong with their married life...

00:23:36.671 --> 00:23:38.213
...is the way she treats the children.

00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:40.421
Maggie means nothing to me.
You know that.

00:23:40.592 --> 00:23:42.051
I wish I could believe it.

00:23:42.218 --> 00:23:45.919
You'd better apologize, or she won't
play gin rummy with you anymore.

00:23:46.097 --> 00:23:48.671
- It is gin rummy, isn't it?
- Now, look, don't go too far.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.468
- One day, I'll call your bluff.
- You're not calling me. I'm calling you.

00:23:52.645 --> 00:23:54.555
You might as well get this straight.

00:23:54.731 --> 00:23:58.942
Those kids come first in this house.
Before either one of us.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.978
Maybe that's right and maybe
it's wrong. But that's the way it is.

00:24:03.156 --> 00:24:07.617
I'll do the best I can for them. If I
can't do it with you, I'll do it alone.

00:24:07.786 --> 00:24:10.787
You're looking for an excuse
to heave me out on my ear.

00:24:10.955 --> 00:24:12.414
- I didn't say-
- I'm fed up.

00:24:12.582 --> 00:24:16.117
Let's see you get along without me. You
want me, you know where to find me.

00:24:16.294 --> 00:24:18.086
Bert.

00:24:18.797 --> 00:24:21.667
You go to that woman's house,
you're never coming back here.

00:24:21.841 --> 00:24:24.083
I go where I want to go.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.880
Then pack up, Bert.

00:24:27.055 --> 00:24:29.261
All right, I will.

00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:36.601
- Kids haven't come home yet, huh?
- No, not yet.

00:24:36.773 --> 00:24:41.980
I don't want you to tell them I said
goodbye or anything like that.

00:24:42.153 --> 00:24:44.858
- You can just say-
- I know. I'll take care of it.

00:24:45.031 --> 00:24:48.068
Okay, then I'll leave it to you.

00:24:50.787 --> 00:24:53.029
Goodbye, Mildred.

00:24:53.206 --> 00:24:57.749
Go on, Bert. There's nothing
more to say. Just go on.

00:25:05.719 --> 00:25:07.711
One, two, three, hike!

00:25:07.887 --> 00:25:09.465
Pass it, pass it!

00:25:09.639 --> 00:25:11.632
Come on!
Pass it!

00:25:14.561 --> 00:25:17.312
- Kay, for goodness' sake!
- What's eating you?

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.315
- You're coming home with me.
- I ain't done nothing.

00:25:20.483 --> 00:25:24.184
- You never let anybody have fun.
- Look at your clothes.

00:25:24.362 --> 00:25:27.778
Honest, Kay, you ought to take
more pride in the way you look.

00:25:27.949 --> 00:25:31.116
- You act like a peasant.
- Oh, pretzels, what do I care?

00:25:31.286 --> 00:25:35.034
You'll care someday, Miss Smarty!
Wait till you get interested in boys.

00:25:35.206 --> 00:25:37.994
I got over that when I was 8.

00:26:00.523 --> 00:26:04.106
- All right, I'll try. Hello, Mom.
- Hello, darling.

00:26:04.277 --> 00:26:06.353
- Good afternoon, Mother.
- Hello, darling.

00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:08.855
- Who's the cake for?
- Eddie Whitley. It's his birthday.

00:26:09.032 --> 00:26:11.238
Oh, that goon.

00:26:11.409 --> 00:26:14.031
- How was your lesson?
- I'm learning a new piece.

00:26:14.204 --> 00:26:15.947
- Are you?
- "Valse Brilliante. "

00:26:16.122 --> 00:26:19.207
- That means "brilliant waltz. "
- Does it really?

00:26:19.376 --> 00:26:20.704
Mm-hm.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.333
I saw Father go out.

00:26:23.505 --> 00:26:27.799
Did you? Why don't you play your
new piece for me? I'd love to hear it.

00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:29.166
All right.

00:26:29.344 --> 00:26:30.589
When do we eat?

00:26:30.762 --> 00:26:32.589
Now you stop that
or you'll spoil your dinner.

00:26:32.764 --> 00:26:34.887
- Okay.
- Look at your clothes.

00:26:35.058 --> 00:26:37.216
I know. I should have been a boy.

00:26:37.394 --> 00:26:39.932
Come on, bring me those dishes
off the sink, will you, darling?

00:26:40.105 --> 00:26:41.765
Okay.

00:26:44.567 --> 00:26:48.897
- Father had a suitcase with him.
- Did he? That's a lovely piece, Veda.

00:26:49.072 --> 00:26:51.527
- Where was he going?
- I don't know.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.985
- How long will he be gone?
- That's hard to say.

00:26:55.161 --> 00:26:56.620
Don't stop playing, darling.

00:26:56.788 --> 00:27:00.655
Is he coming back?
Has he gone for good?

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.039
Look, you might as well know it now.

00:27:07.215 --> 00:27:09.421
Your father and I
have decided to separate.

00:27:09.592 --> 00:27:12.262
You mean, Dad's not
coming home anymore?

00:27:12.429 --> 00:27:16.841
- Doesn't he like us?
- It has nothing to do with you, honey.

00:27:17.017 --> 00:27:20.717
It just couldn't be helped. We'll have
to get along by ourselves now.

00:27:20.895 --> 00:27:23.813
What did you and Father quarrel about?

00:27:23.982 --> 00:27:26.899
I can't tell you now.
Someday I will, but not now.

00:27:27.068 --> 00:27:30.817
If you mean Mrs. Biederhof,
I must say my sympathy is all with you.

00:27:30.989 --> 00:27:34.939
- She's distinctly middle class.
- Please, Veda. It wasn't Mrs. Biederhof.

00:27:35.118 --> 00:27:37.787
It was little things.
Mostly about your dress.

00:27:37.954 --> 00:27:39.069
My dress?

00:27:39.247 --> 00:27:41.240
- It came?
- Yes, it's upstairs in your room.

00:27:41.416 --> 00:27:45.283
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, okay.

00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:49.377
You ought to do something
about your sit-down.

00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:52.005
- What's wrong with it?
- Sticks out.

00:27:52.177 --> 00:27:56.673
It's the dress. It's awful cheap
material. I can tell by the smell.

00:27:56.848 --> 00:27:59.304
What do you expect,
want it inlaid with gold?

00:27:59.476 --> 00:28:02.642
It seems to me if you're buying
anything, it should be the best.

00:28:02.812 --> 00:28:07.190
- This is definitely not the best.
- Quit. You're breaking my heart.

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:09.150
Oh, it's impossible.

00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:12.273
Look at it. Ruffles.

00:28:12.447 --> 00:28:16.112
I wouldn't be seen dead
in this rag. It's horrible.

00:28:16.284 --> 00:28:19.368
How could she have bought me
such a thing?

00:28:23.333 --> 00:28:27.165
<i>It didn't take me long that night
to figure out that I was dead broke.</i>

00:28:27.337 --> 00:28:30.920
<i>And with Bert gone,
it looked as though I'd stay broke.</i>

00:28:31.091 --> 00:28:35.135
<i>I felt all alone. For the first time
in my life, I was lonely.</i>

00:28:35.303 --> 00:28:40.179
<i>There was so much to remind me of Bert.
How things used to be with us.</i>

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.102
<i>And what great hopes we had.</i>

00:29:00.537 --> 00:29:02.031
- Hi, Mildred!
- Hello, Wally.

00:29:02.205 --> 00:29:04.447
- Bert around?
- Not right now, he isn't.

00:29:04.624 --> 00:29:08.492
He left things a mess at the office.
I thought he could straighten them out.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.537
- Ask him to drop over, will you?
- lf it's important, find him yourself.

00:29:12.716 --> 00:29:15.041
He isn't living here anymore.

00:29:16.344 --> 00:29:19.131
- You mean you've busted up?
- Something like that.

00:29:19.305 --> 00:29:22.840
- For good?
- As far as I know.

00:29:23.018 --> 00:29:26.137
If you don't know,
I don't know who does know.

00:29:26.312 --> 00:29:30.013
- You here all alone?
- No, I have the children.

00:29:30.191 --> 00:29:31.816
Bert must be crazy.

00:29:31.985 --> 00:29:35.650
You know, I never did mind
being around you, Mildred.

00:29:35.822 --> 00:29:38.147
You don't hear opportunity knocking,
do you?

00:29:38.324 --> 00:29:41.575
Me? I'm conscientious.

00:29:41.745 --> 00:29:45.742
Not too much ice in that drink
you're about to make for me.

00:29:45.915 --> 00:29:47.458
- You're moving in?
- Maybe.

00:29:47.625 --> 00:29:50.662
Anyhow, I won't cry my eyes out
about you and Bert splitting up.

00:29:50.837 --> 00:29:54.502
I like the idea.
It makes me feel good.

00:29:54.674 --> 00:29:57.248
I wish it made me feel good too.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.636
- I like Scotch.
- I know what you like.

00:30:01.806 --> 00:30:03.431
With soda.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.435
I've always been soft in the head
where you're concerned.

00:30:06.603 --> 00:30:08.595
- You surprise me.
- This is on the level.

00:30:08.772 --> 00:30:12.105
Bert's gone. Okay. I figure maybe
there's a chance for me now.

00:30:12.275 --> 00:30:14.731
I wouldn't drop dead
at the idea of marrying you.

00:30:14.903 --> 00:30:16.065
Quit kidding, will you?

00:30:16.237 --> 00:30:18.526
I figured maybe one day
you might have a weak moment.

00:30:18.698 --> 00:30:22.032
If I do, I'll send you
a telegram, collect.

00:30:23.787 --> 00:30:26.788
Easy on the ice for this, will you?
No soda?

00:30:26.956 --> 00:30:30.622
- Sorry. Bert never had it around.
- We'll take care of that.

00:30:30.794 --> 00:30:33.664
- Say when.
- Not for me. I'm not used to it.

00:30:33.838 --> 00:30:35.831
We'll take care of that too.

00:30:36.007 --> 00:30:39.341
- You're sure of yourself, aren't you?
- You gotta be educated.

00:30:39.511 --> 00:30:41.634
You just joined
the world's biggest army.

00:30:41.805 --> 00:30:44.759
The great American institution
never mentioned on the Fourth of July.

00:30:44.933 --> 00:30:48.053
A grass widow
with two children to support.

00:30:50.313 --> 00:30:52.353
Why don't you make an effort
to grow up?

00:30:52.524 --> 00:30:54.232
You make an effort to forget Bert.

00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:56.856
- Maybe I don't want to.
- But you'll be lonesome.

00:30:57.028 --> 00:30:59.733
- You can't get along by yourself.
- Well, I can try.

00:30:59.906 --> 00:31:02.990
- Come on, get wise.
- Wally, you should be kept on a leash.

00:31:03.159 --> 00:31:05.733
- Why can't you be friendly?
- I am being friendly.

00:31:05.912 --> 00:31:08.581
I mean it. Friendship's much more
lasting than love.

00:31:08.748 --> 00:31:11.322
Yeah, but it isn't as entertaining.

00:31:11.501 --> 00:31:14.502
Cut it out. You make me feel
like Little Red Riding Hood.

00:31:14.671 --> 00:31:16.082
And I'm the Big Bad Wolf?

00:31:16.256 --> 00:31:19.625
You got me wrong.
I'm a romantic guy, but I'm no wolf.

00:31:19.801 --> 00:31:22.636
Then quit howling!
I know you romantic guys.

00:31:22.804 --> 00:31:25.591
One crack about the moon
and you're off to the races.

00:31:25.765 --> 00:31:29.810
- Especially when it looks like a sure thing.
- Here we go again.

00:31:29.978 --> 00:31:32.101
Did I do something wrong?

00:31:32.272 --> 00:31:34.015
You'd better go, Wally.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.349
- No dice, huh?
- Good night.

00:31:36.526 --> 00:31:38.768
Well, no dice, no dice.

00:31:38.945 --> 00:31:41.353
You can't shoot a guy for trying.

00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:45.315
I just thought maybe that-
Oh, Mildred, I was only kidding.

00:31:45.493 --> 00:31:47.652
I wouldn't pull any cheap tricks
on you.

00:31:47.829 --> 00:31:49.454
- You know that.
- Yes, I know.

00:31:49.622 --> 00:31:50.951
Why-

00:31:52.542 --> 00:31:56.540
- I said good night, Wally.
- Okay. Round one goes to Mildred.

00:31:56.713 --> 00:32:00.046
- There won't be any round two.
- I'll keep on trying.

00:32:00.216 --> 00:32:04.214
- I know, once a week.
- Twice a week.

00:32:10.018 --> 00:32:11.892
- Veda! You awake?
- Yes, Mother.

00:32:12.062 --> 00:32:17.352
- Shh. You'll wake Kay.
- No. She's tired out.

00:32:17.525 --> 00:32:21.060
- She cried herself to sleep.
- Was it about her father?

00:32:21.237 --> 00:32:25.899
Yes.
Is he going to marry Mrs. Biederhof?

00:32:26.076 --> 00:32:29.409
- I don't know.
- I do.

00:32:29.579 --> 00:32:32.913
I do know that you should be asleep.

00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:35.870
- I've been thinking.
- What about?

00:32:36.044 --> 00:32:40.089
- I heard you and Wally talking.
- Well?

00:32:40.256 --> 00:32:43.590
- You could marry him if you wanted.
- I'm not in love with him.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.595
But then maybe we could have
a maid like we used to...

00:32:46.763 --> 00:32:51.555
...and a limousine.
And maybe a new house.

00:32:51.726 --> 00:32:53.434
I don't like this house.

00:32:53.603 --> 00:32:58.099
Neither do I. But that's no reason
to marry a man I'm not in love with.

00:32:58.274 --> 00:32:59.603
Why not?

00:33:00.735 --> 00:33:06.240
Veda, does a new house mean so much
to you that you would trade me for it?

00:33:06.408 --> 00:33:08.447
I didn't mean it, Mother.

00:33:08.618 --> 00:33:12.117
I don't care what we have,
as long as we're together.

00:33:12.288 --> 00:33:15.076
It's just that there's
so many things that l-

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.788
That we should have and haven't got.

00:33:17.961 --> 00:33:21.211
I know, darling. I know.

00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:26.541
I want you to have nice things.
And you will have. Wait and see.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.800
I'll get you everything.
Anything you want. I promise.

00:33:30.974 --> 00:33:32.717
How?

00:33:32.892 --> 00:33:35.300
I don't know.

00:33:35.478 --> 00:33:40.721
- But I will, I promise.
- You darling.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.985
- Come on, go to sleep.
- All right.

00:33:44.154 --> 00:33:46.727
- Happy dreams, sweetie.
- Thank you.

00:33:46.906 --> 00:33:51.901
- I love you, Veda.
- I love you, Mother. Really, I do.

00:33:52.078 --> 00:33:54.652
But let's not be sticky about it.

00:33:59.336 --> 00:34:00.664
Good night.

00:34:07.052 --> 00:34:09.803
<i>I had to get a job, any kind.</i>

00:34:09.971 --> 00:34:13.672
<i>I had no experience in the business world,
but I had to get a job.</i>

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:17.599
<i>I walked my legs off. Getting a job
wasn't as easy as I thought.</i>

00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:22.183
<i>Days seemed like weeks, and everywhere
I went I heard the same thing:</i>

00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:24.517
Sorry, we need people with experience.

00:34:24.694 --> 00:34:27.897
<i>I was sick at heart
when I saw the restaurant.</i>

00:34:28.073 --> 00:34:30.279
<i>I decided to go in for a cup of tea.</i>

00:34:35.497 --> 00:34:37.370
Good afternoon.

00:34:42.379 --> 00:34:43.707
Sit here?

00:34:44.798 --> 00:34:46.043
Menu.

00:34:47.634 --> 00:34:52.212
Clear the dirty dishes
off number three. Pick up your feet!

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:55.306
- Roast chicken is nice.
- No, thank you. I'll....

00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:57.266
I caught you red-handed.

00:34:57.435 --> 00:34:59.475
I didn't take your rotten tip.

00:34:59.646 --> 00:35:03.394
- What's the trouble?
- She's lifting tips. I've seen her.

00:35:04.567 --> 00:35:07.105
Go into the kitchen.
You keep out of it.

00:35:07.278 --> 00:35:10.730
How about some service?
- Someone will take care of you right away.

00:35:10.907 --> 00:35:15.119
- I hope so. I have-
- You mind your own business.

00:35:15.286 --> 00:35:19.236
Sorry to leave you like that,
but we're so short-handed.

00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:21.871
- You wanted tea?
- No, I want a job.

00:35:22.043 --> 00:35:25.080
- What?
- Well, you seem to need help....

00:35:25.255 --> 00:35:27.129
I want a job.

00:35:27.298 --> 00:35:31.925
- You ever work in a restaurant before?
- No.

00:35:33.513 --> 00:35:34.888
Follow me.

00:35:37.892 --> 00:35:41.096
- Kind of a nervous gal, aren't you?
- I'm just a little anxious.

00:35:41.271 --> 00:35:44.272
You want to watch that.
It's tough on dishes.

00:35:44.441 --> 00:35:49.103
I don't think you're the type for
the work, but I'll give you a trial.

00:35:49.279 --> 00:35:53.608
You need white shoes. Ask for nurses'
regulation in any store. $2.95.

00:35:53.783 --> 00:35:56.986
We furnish the uniform, but it
comes off your check. $3.95.

00:35:57.162 --> 00:35:59.285
You get it at cost.
Keep it laundered.

00:35:59.456 --> 00:36:04.034
If you don't suit us, we charge you 25
cents. That comes off your check too.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.870
Keep your own tips.

00:36:06.046 --> 00:36:07.919
Here, have your tea.

00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:09.252
Thank you.

00:36:09.424 --> 00:36:12.259
- What's your name?
- Ida, what's yours?

00:36:12.427 --> 00:36:14.669
Mildred Pierce.

00:36:14.846 --> 00:36:17.302
Chef's salad. Hold the mayonnaise.

00:36:17.474 --> 00:36:20.759
- Two plates, hold the potatoes.
- Two chops, medium and rare.

00:36:20.935 --> 00:36:22.928
Two chicken dinners.
One without gravy.

00:36:23.104 --> 00:36:25.891
Two chickens. Hold one gravy.
Not "without," say hold.

00:36:26.066 --> 00:36:29.102
<i>I learned the restaurant business
the hard way.</i>

00:36:29.277 --> 00:36:31.234
<i>In three weeks,
I was a good waitress.</i>

00:36:31.404 --> 00:36:33.527
- One chicken. Hold veg.
Chicken. Hold veg.

00:36:33.698 --> 00:36:37.992
Steak, medium. Club san. Roast beef.
Hold one. Combin salad.

00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:41.495
<i>In six weeks, I felt like I'd
worked in a restaurant all my life.</i>

00:36:41.665 --> 00:36:44.369
<i>In three months, I was one
of the best waitresses there.</i>

00:36:44.542 --> 00:36:46.582
<i>I took tips and was glad to get them.</i>

00:36:46.753 --> 00:36:49.326
<i>And at home I baked pies
for the restaurant.</i>

00:36:49.506 --> 00:36:54.631
Those'll be done in minutes.
We have a dozen peach, a dozen berry...

00:36:54.803 --> 00:36:58.847
...a dozen pumpkin, a dozen cherry.
After we finish the apple, we can quit.

00:36:59.015 --> 00:37:02.431
I don't know how you keep it up.
Honest, I don't.

00:37:02.602 --> 00:37:07.229
I sleep all morning, but you go to
that restaurant and work and work.

00:37:07.399 --> 00:37:10.684
Just like you been sleeping all night,
only you ain't.

00:37:11.027 --> 00:37:14.479
- It keeps me thin.
- Beg pardon?

00:37:14.656 --> 00:37:17.408
It don't do nothing for me.

00:37:17.575 --> 00:37:20.861
<i>I was doing all right.
I was doing fine.</i>

00:37:21.037 --> 00:37:24.702
<i>I was able to afford an expensive
singing teacher for Veda...</i>

00:37:24.874 --> 00:37:26.914
<i>...and a good dancing school for Kay.</i>

00:37:27.085 --> 00:37:31.711
<i>One thing worried me. That some day
Veda would find out I was a waitress.</i>

00:37:31.881 --> 00:37:34.717
- Good afternoon.
- Everything go all right?

00:37:34.884 --> 00:37:38.384
- Oh, I had a busy day today.
- That's good.

00:37:39.681 --> 00:37:42.551
- Where did you get that uniform?
- Miss Veda.

00:37:42.726 --> 00:37:46.059
She makes me wear it in case
I have to answer the doorbell.

00:37:46.229 --> 00:37:47.972
Miss Veda gave it to you?

00:37:48.148 --> 00:37:51.682
I told her you wouldn't like it.
I told her right off.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.525
But she hollered and went on,
so I put it on just to keep her quiet.

00:38:15.842 --> 00:38:18.594
- Is that what you learned at ballet?
- Do you like it?

00:38:18.762 --> 00:38:20.470
- What have you got on your face?
- Well, l-

00:38:20.638 --> 00:38:22.181
It's just some lipstick.

00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:23.594
- Lottie!
- Yes?

00:38:23.767 --> 00:38:27.266
Take Kay upstairs and wash her face
and give her a good scrubbing.

00:38:27.437 --> 00:38:30.391
My face don't need scrubbing.
I washed it this morning.

00:38:30.565 --> 00:38:34.266
- Go on, hurry up.
- It can stand more soap and water.

00:38:40.784 --> 00:38:43.239
- Veda.
- Yes, Mother, what is it?

00:38:43.411 --> 00:38:46.946
- Where did you find the uniform?
- I was looking for a handkerchief.

00:38:47.123 --> 00:38:49.032
- In my closet?
- I looked everywhere.

00:38:49.209 --> 00:38:53.289
Your handkerchiefs are always in your
top drawer. Why were you in my closet?

00:38:53.463 --> 00:38:57.461
You're making quite a fuss about
something which doesn't matter.

00:38:57.634 --> 00:39:02.130
If you bought the uniform for Lottie, and
I can't imagine who else it would be for...

00:39:02.305 --> 00:39:04.132
...then why shouldn't she wear it?

00:39:04.307 --> 00:39:08.435
You've been snooping since I got this
job trying to find out what it is.

00:39:08.603 --> 00:39:10.809
And now you know, don't you?

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.396
Know what? Know what, Mother?

00:39:14.567 --> 00:39:17.818
You knew when you gave that uniform
to Lottie that it was mine.

00:39:17.987 --> 00:39:21.403
- Your uniform?
- Yes. I'm waiting tables downtown.

00:39:21.574 --> 00:39:24.148
My mother. A waitress.

00:39:24.327 --> 00:39:28.241
I took that job so you and your sister
could eat, sleep and have clothes.

00:39:28.415 --> 00:39:30.953
Aren't the pies bad enough?
Did you have to degrade us?

00:39:31.126 --> 00:39:33.332
- Don't talk like that!
- I'm not surprised.

00:39:33.503 --> 00:39:36.124
You've never spoken of your people,
who you came from...

00:39:36.297 --> 00:39:39.501
...so perhaps it's natural.
Maybe that's why Father-

00:39:48.893 --> 00:39:53.805
I'm sorry I did that.
I'd have rather cut off my hand.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.729
I'd never have taken the job
if I hadn't wanted to keep us all together.

00:39:59.904 --> 00:40:03.736
Besides, I wanted to learn
the business the best way possible.

00:40:03.908 --> 00:40:07.858
- What kind of business?
- The restaurant business.

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:10.030
I'm planning on opening
a place of my own.

00:40:10.248 --> 00:40:12.704
There's money in a restaurant.

00:40:12.876 --> 00:40:18.629
- You mean we'll be rich?
- Some people have gotten rich that way.

00:40:18.798 --> 00:40:21.835
<i>I didn't know what to do next,
but suddenly it hit me.</i>

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.504
<i>Why not open a restaurant?</i>

00:40:23.678 --> 00:40:26.881
In the 7th, give me five
across the board on Materialize.

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:28.302
Hello. Grab a seat.

00:40:28.475 --> 00:40:31.926
What? I know it's a dog,
but I happen to like red horses.

00:40:32.103 --> 00:40:33.847
Call me back, will you?

00:40:34.022 --> 00:40:35.682
- Well, well, well.
- Hello, Wally.

00:40:35.857 --> 00:40:38.562
- It's good to see you.
- It's nice to see you. Sit down.

00:40:38.735 --> 00:40:43.064
- I haven't seen enough of you lately.
- This is all business.

00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:47.023
If you keep on refusing me,
I'm gonna think you're stubborn.

00:40:47.202 --> 00:40:49.075
Laugh? No laugh?

00:40:49.245 --> 00:40:51.072
What's all this?

00:40:51.247 --> 00:40:54.083
- I'm going to open a restaurant.
- You are?

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.251
- And you're going to help me.
- I am? I mean, am I?

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.460
Please, Wally.

00:40:59.631 --> 00:41:01.670
I guess I am. What's the score?

00:41:01.841 --> 00:41:06.053
I found the location. An old house
that hasn't been lived in for years.

00:41:06.221 --> 00:41:09.305
It's on a busy intersection.
So it's good for drive-in trade.

00:41:09.474 --> 00:41:12.345
I clocked an average
of 500 cars an hour.

00:41:12.519 --> 00:41:14.013
Do you realize what that means?

00:41:14.187 --> 00:41:16.180
There isn't another restaurant
in five miles.

00:41:16.356 --> 00:41:21.018
- It listens good. What's the address?
-35904 Glen Oaks Blvd.

00:41:21.194 --> 00:41:23.946
35904 Glen Oaks Blvd?
Who owns it?

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:26.272
I don't know,
but there's a "For Sale" sign.

00:41:26.449 --> 00:41:29.071
- Let's see.
- I need help in getting this place.

00:41:29.244 --> 00:41:32.328
You know the angles. I want
that house. Please get it.

00:41:32.497 --> 00:41:38.037
All right. 35907, 35904.
There we are!

00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:39.539
It's listed at $ 10,000.

00:41:39.713 --> 00:41:42.797
They'll take eight or less.
They want to move the property.

00:41:42.966 --> 00:41:45.967
- And it's owned by the Beragon Estate.
- Do you know them?

00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:50.180
No. They're some wealthy Pasadena family
got property here. Beragon Manor.

00:41:50.348 --> 00:41:52.056
Beragon Estate. There.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:57.726
- Well, what do you know.
- What is it? Tell me.

00:41:57.897 --> 00:42:00.898
Beragons have lost two properties
because of back taxes.

00:42:01.067 --> 00:42:04.982
It sounds as if they're broke. Using
your gams all day hasn't hurt them.

00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:10.149
Hello! Hello! Mr. Beragon, please.
Now watch your Uncle Wally go to work.

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:13.826
How do you do? This is
Wallace Fay of Fay Real Estate.

00:42:13.997 --> 00:42:17.033
I've been looking forward
to calling you for some time.

00:42:17.208 --> 00:42:20.660
It's regarding your property
on Glen Oaks Boulevard.

00:42:20.837 --> 00:42:25.333
I've succeeded in interesting a client
in the possibility of a purchase.

00:42:25.508 --> 00:42:28.213
- Well, how about...?
- This afternoon.

00:42:28.386 --> 00:42:30.462
Yeah. How about this afternoon?

00:42:30.638 --> 00:42:32.761
Good. We'll be right down.

00:42:32.932 --> 00:42:37.511
Fay is the name. No, Fay.
That's right. Goodbye.

00:42:37.687 --> 00:42:40.937
He's sweating blood already.
Come on, let's go.

00:42:41.107 --> 00:42:43.777
And, remember,
let me do all the talking.

00:42:43.943 --> 00:42:48.024
- Oh, Wally, you're wonderful!
- Ah, ah. This is all business, remember?

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:59.366
Yep! This is it.

00:43:13.348 --> 00:43:15.590
Will you wait here, please?

00:43:31.866 --> 00:43:34.618
Mr. Beragon, I talked to you
on the phone.

00:43:34.786 --> 00:43:36.779
This is Mrs. Pierce, the client.

00:43:36.955 --> 00:43:39.244
How do you do?
- How do you do?

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:41.207
Would you like a drink?

00:43:41.376 --> 00:43:44.994
- I'm trapped. You talked me into it.
- Mrs. Pierce?

00:43:45.171 --> 00:43:48.505
As I see it, she wants the house
but doesn't want to pay.

00:43:48.675 --> 00:43:52.091
Well, that's about it.
Mrs. Pierce needs time to get started.

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:55.465
But once the restaurant is successful,
she'll buy the property outright.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.929
I see. A very unusual proposition.

00:43:58.101 --> 00:44:01.636
- How long do you need, Mrs. Pierce?
- I'd say about a year.

00:44:01.813 --> 00:44:04.767
- You think you can make $ 10,000?
- Yes, I have it all-

00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:07.776
Look, if the place is successful,
it'll be very successful.

00:44:07.944 --> 00:44:11.230
If it isn't, you'll get your
property back in better condition.

00:44:11.406 --> 00:44:13.648
What do you say? It's a gamble,
but you can't lose much.

00:44:13.825 --> 00:44:18.072
I like to gamble, Mr. Fay.
But the odds are against me.

00:44:18.246 --> 00:44:21.662
- I'm afraid I'm not interested.
- Please, listen to me.

00:44:21.833 --> 00:44:23.458
This is a gamble for me too.

00:44:23.626 --> 00:44:27.126
I'm putting every cent
I have into this place. I haven't much.

00:44:27.297 --> 00:44:30.547
I can't afford to lose.
I've got all the information.

00:44:30.717 --> 00:44:33.290
I know what it will cost
and how much I can make.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.758
I know I can do it. I know I can!

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.175
- Very well. It's a deal.
- Great! I'll draw up the papers.

00:44:41.353 --> 00:44:44.935
One more thing. We need
a pre-dated transfer of ownership.

00:44:45.106 --> 00:44:46.648
- You want it immediately?
- Yeah.

00:44:46.816 --> 00:44:49.438
We'll give you a note,
you give us the deed.

00:44:49.611 --> 00:44:51.983
You take care of the details.

00:44:52.155 --> 00:44:55.489
Well, how does it feel to be
the owner of a white elephant?

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:58.695
Oh, it feels wonderful!

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.408
How about Uncle Wally?

00:45:02.999 --> 00:45:04.992
- Nice guy.
- Very. Good-looking too.

00:45:05.168 --> 00:45:07.244
- Maybe, but no brains.
- What do you mean?

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.457
You conning him out of the deed
without putting down a cent.

00:45:10.632 --> 00:45:13.716
- Sure!
- You leave the angles to Uncle Wally.

00:45:13.885 --> 00:45:16.554
- There's one other thing to do.
- What's that?

00:45:16.721 --> 00:45:19.010
Sorry.
I don't feel romantic this afternoon.

00:45:19.182 --> 00:45:21.934
No, nothing like that.
It's serious. It's about Bert.

00:45:22.102 --> 00:45:24.225
- What's on your mind?
- You won't like it.

00:45:24.396 --> 00:45:27.811
You'll have to get a divorce
if you want to open that restaurant.

00:45:27.982 --> 00:45:29.607
What's that got to do with it?

00:45:29.776 --> 00:45:32.349
In California, they got
a community property law.

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:35.530
- Half of what's Bert's is yours.
- What's half of nothing?

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:38.272
It works two ways.
Half of what you own is Bert's.

00:45:38.451 --> 00:45:42.615
You open that restaurant and Bert's
creditors will be saying, "Give me. "

00:45:42.789 --> 00:45:44.616
- Is a divorce the only answer?
- Uh-huh. Why?

00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:48.160
- It takes a year to get a divorce.
- Are you getting cold feet?

00:45:48.336 --> 00:45:49.961
Why bother if it takes a year?

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.962
It takes a year to be final. Once
entered, the creditors can't touch you.

00:45:54.134 --> 00:45:57.051
- Your worries are over.
- I'll be seeing Bert next week.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.793
He's coming to take
the children for the weekend.

00:45:59.973 --> 00:46:02.428
- I'll think about it.
- Nothing to think about!

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.851
- No divorce, no restaurant!
- I'll think about it, Wally!

00:46:06.021 --> 00:46:10.149
I'd have to know a little more about
it. Divorce is serious. I'm not-

00:46:10.316 --> 00:46:11.645
- Hello, Dad!
- Hello, dear.

00:46:11.818 --> 00:46:13.229
We'll be down in a minute.

00:46:13.403 --> 00:46:16.072
Veda wants to know where
her new bathing suit is.

00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:19.608
- It's in the top drawer of her dresser.
- Okay!

00:46:19.784 --> 00:46:23.284
She says it's in the upper drawer
of the dresser.

00:46:26.333 --> 00:46:27.743
Here.

00:46:29.169 --> 00:46:31.742
I wonder if there are many boys
up at Arrowhead.

00:46:31.921 --> 00:46:35.006
If there are, they're sure to find you.
Don't worry.

00:46:35.342 --> 00:46:38.675
I hate this as much as you.
But it's got to be, for the children.

00:46:38.845 --> 00:46:40.588
I have to think of their future.

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.424
- Of Veda, you mean.
- All right, of Veda.

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:46.098
- What about Kay?
- Kay doesn't need so much thinking about.

00:46:46.269 --> 00:46:50.433
Kay's twice the girl Veda is and always
will be. She thinks you're wonderful.

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:54.439
- Maybe that's why I try to please Veda.
- You'll always get kicked around.

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:58.276
You ought to know. I've made up
my mind. I want a divorce.

00:46:58.448 --> 00:47:00.773
I want to know a whole lot
more about this deal.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.488
- What have you got to do with that?
- You're my wife.

00:47:03.662 --> 00:47:07.327
You seem to forget about it
when it comes to Maggie Biederhof.

00:47:07.499 --> 00:47:12.374
- Well, what about you and Wally Fay?
- You should know better than that.

00:47:12.545 --> 00:47:16.211
Bert, listen. I've put everything
I've got into this restaurant.

00:47:16.383 --> 00:47:18.790
I've worked with painters, carpenters,
electricians.

00:47:18.968 --> 00:47:21.720
And suddenly,
everything is beginning to take shape.

00:47:21.888 --> 00:47:24.640
I've worked hard.
I'm going to get that divorce.

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:27.346
I know. You want me to poke you
in the nose...

00:47:27.519 --> 00:47:30.140
...so you can claim I was guilty of cruelty.

00:47:30.313 --> 00:47:33.231
No, Mildred. No divorce.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.400
I'm going to file papers.
There's little you can do about it.

00:47:36.569 --> 00:47:40.437
- I don't need your permission.
- No? Well, file away.

00:47:40.615 --> 00:47:43.071
I'll fight you all the way.
You and Wally Fay.

00:47:43.243 --> 00:47:47.655
- And what's more, I'm-
You don't have to worry about me.

00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:50.452
Well, that was quick.
My, how nice you look.

00:47:50.625 --> 00:47:52.997
- Thank you.
- Hello, Father.

00:47:53.169 --> 00:47:56.123
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye, darling.

00:47:56.297 --> 00:47:59.832
Have fun. Be careful swimming.
That water's awfully cold!

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.417
Bye!
- Bye!

00:48:02.595 --> 00:48:04.968
Dad, on the way,
can we stop and have a hamburger?

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.473
Oh, I guess so.
We'll have to hurry, though.

00:48:26.619 --> 00:48:30.119
It's moments like this that make
me happy that nylons are out.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.828
Well, if it isn't our silent partner.

00:48:33.001 --> 00:48:36.370
I've been silent long enough.
I came to check on my investment.

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:39.333
- Well, how do you like it?
- Delightful.

00:48:39.507 --> 00:48:41.500
Sure you're here
to check on your investment?

00:48:41.676 --> 00:48:45.010
- Oh, absolutely.
- Then you'd better look.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:49.224
Over there's the counter. Here will be
one table and over here four tables.

00:48:49.392 --> 00:48:52.678
We have 10 booths, four people
to a booth. That's 40 people.

00:48:52.854 --> 00:48:54.514
- We can expect to feed-
- Ingenious.

00:48:54.689 --> 00:48:57.394
But today's a holiday.
Why don't you get out of here?

00:48:57.567 --> 00:49:00.936
I'd love to, but I'm awfully busy.
Isn't the bar beautiful?

00:49:01.112 --> 00:49:04.896
I've got one at the beach house.
Why don't you come see my ocean?

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:07.910
I've seen one. If you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:11.529
Why should people come to eat
and go someplace else to drink?

00:49:11.706 --> 00:49:14.743
- That's why I put the bar in-
- Logical. But, back to my ocean.

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:17.539
Why don't we go have a swim
and forget about our investment?

00:49:17.712 --> 00:49:19.420
Oh, I'd love to, but....

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:22.341
- Uh-uh. Got too much to do.
- Come on.

00:49:22.509 --> 00:49:23.967
Look out. I might say yes.

00:49:24.135 --> 00:49:26.922
- You know what might be highly original?
- No. What?

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:30.430
Just say yes. Right away like that.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.142
No. No, I shouldn't.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:35.809
You'll find that the only things you
regret are the things you didn't do.

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.225
I hope you're right.

00:49:37.399 --> 00:49:41.646
Look. Why don't I pick you up
in, say, 30 minutes.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.690
No, I really can't.

00:49:44.864 --> 00:49:49.906
- How about it?
- All right. You win.

00:49:54.082 --> 00:49:59.871
There you are. Just help yourself. If you
don't find what you want, let me know.

00:50:00.046 --> 00:50:03.498
- Are you hoarding bathing suits?
- They belong to my sisters.

00:50:03.675 --> 00:50:05.833
There's nothing like having
a large family.

00:50:06.011 --> 00:50:10.008
- Yell if you need help with the zipper.
- Thank you, but I won't need any help.

00:50:10.181 --> 00:50:14.309
- How do you like your drink?
- Harmless.

00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:24.567
- I like your ocean.
- I borrowed it from the Navy just for you.

00:50:24.738 --> 00:50:28.356
- You have a wonderful view.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

00:50:28.533 --> 00:50:30.656
I hope the suit fits better
than the robe.

00:50:30.827 --> 00:50:33.614
It does.
Do you live here year round?

00:50:33.788 --> 00:50:37.157
No, we have a family mansion
in Pasadena. Complete with iron deer...

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:40.418
...a ghost and a greenhouse.
I come here in the spring.

00:50:40.587 --> 00:50:42.994
- It must be lovely.
- Yes, but lonely.

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:47.716
In the spring, a man's fancy turns to
what he's thought about all winter.

00:50:47.886 --> 00:50:51.219
It's a good thing California winters
are so short.

00:50:53.808 --> 00:50:58.020
- No whistle?
- I'd need a police siren.

00:50:58.188 --> 00:51:00.939
- Well, here we go.
- Go? Go where?

00:51:01.107 --> 00:51:05.686
- Swimming. Isn't that why we're here?
- I suppose it is. Wait a minute.

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:07.855
- Come on.
- Hold it.

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:25.958
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

00:51:26.132 --> 00:51:29.833
- You drink too much.
- I do too much of everything. I'm spoiled.

00:51:30.011 --> 00:51:32.716
Too many sisters.
They all seem to be my size too.

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:34.549
Yes. I like them your size.

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:38.058
- To brotherly love!
- Thank you, Mr. Beragon.

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:41.763
Monte Beragon.
That's a very unusual name. Spanish?

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.265
Mostly. Maybe a little
Italian thrown in.

00:51:44.442 --> 00:51:46.898
But my mother is
a real dyed-in-the-wool Yankee.

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:51.115
That's why I'm such a self-controlled
and dignified young fellow.

00:51:51.282 --> 00:51:53.074
And just what do you do?

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:57.454
I loaf in a decorative
and highly charming manner.

00:51:57.622 --> 00:52:02.035
- Is that all?
- With me, loafing is a science.

00:52:03.378 --> 00:52:08.087
- You're very beautiful like that.
- I bet you say that to all your sisters.

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:10.713
- Shall I tell your fortune?
- Can you?

00:52:10.885 --> 00:52:15.547
We Beragons come from
a long line of teacup readers.

00:52:15.724 --> 00:52:20.302
I'm not very impressionable. I lost
my awe of women at an early age.

00:52:20.478 --> 00:52:25.686
But ever since you came here, I thought
of what I'd say when we met again.

00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:28.978
Now I can't say anything.

00:52:29.154 --> 00:52:33.234
- You take my breath away.
- Do I?

00:52:33.408 --> 00:52:38.236
I like you, Monte. You make me feel-

00:52:38.413 --> 00:52:43.538
- I don't know, warm.
- And wanted? Beautiful?

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:44.789
Yes.

00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:49.338
When I'm close to you, there's a sound
in the air like the beating of wings.

00:52:49.507 --> 00:52:52.378
- You know what it is?
- No. What?

00:52:52.552 --> 00:52:56.087
My heart. Beating like a schoolboy's.

00:52:56.264 --> 00:53:01.140
Is it? I thought it was mine.

00:53:05.023 --> 00:53:06.303
The record.

00:53:08.193 --> 00:53:10.481
Monte, the record.

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:21.830
Is he there yet? That's good.

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:24.323
I think I have everything we need.

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:27.834
Yeah, I called everywhere.
I'll wait another five minutes.

00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:29.997
Wait. I think she's coming now.

00:53:36.429 --> 00:53:37.971
Promise?
- I don't know.

00:53:38.139 --> 00:53:40.891
- Thursday? Friday?
- Make it Wednesday.

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:44.805
- Good. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:53:50.026 --> 00:53:52.102
- Where have you been?
- What are you doing here?

00:53:52.278 --> 00:53:55.813
I've been looking all over for you.
I've been nearly nuts.

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:58.826
- What is it?
- It's Kay. She's sick.

00:53:58.994 --> 00:54:01.615
We came down from Arrowhead
80 miles an hour, but-

00:54:01.788 --> 00:54:05.371
- Well, it's pneumonia.
- Oh, no.

00:54:06.668 --> 00:54:08.542
She isn't here.

00:54:10.338 --> 00:54:13.588
She isn't here? Where is she?

00:54:13.758 --> 00:54:15.632
Mrs. Biederhof's.

00:54:15.802 --> 00:54:17.344
Mrs. Biederhof...

00:54:18.179 --> 00:54:21.595
I was frantic. I didn't know
what to do. I sent for Dr. Gale.

00:54:21.766 --> 00:54:24.720
It's all right, Bert, just hurry!

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:49.456
Mommy!

00:54:49.627 --> 00:54:52.712
Yes, darling, Mommy's here.

00:54:58.136 --> 00:54:59.844
More oxygen.

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:17.145
I hope it was all right to bring her
here instead of the hospital.

00:55:17.322 --> 00:55:21.616
- But I thought it would save time.
You did the right thing.

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:25.652
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Biederhof.

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.498
- Nurse?
- Yes, doctor?

00:55:37.676 --> 00:55:39.668
One more cc.

00:55:56.695 --> 00:55:59.898
I'm sorry. I couldn't save her.

00:56:34.941 --> 00:56:39.484
I'm sorry, Mildred.
We did everything in our power.

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:48.201
I brought her into the world,
and it seems hard that I was the one to-

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:51.538
I'll fix you a nice, hot cup of tea.

00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:05.383
I'll never forget her.

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:08.639
Never, as long as I live.

00:57:08.808 --> 00:57:11.726
She said, "Mommy! "

00:57:12.937 --> 00:57:14.729
And that was all.

00:57:16.316 --> 00:57:18.273
I loved her so much.

00:57:19.778 --> 00:57:20.892
Mother.

00:57:22.822 --> 00:57:27.152
Please, God, don't ever let
anything happen to Veda!

00:57:29.249 --> 00:57:31.241
<i>After that,
only one thing was on my mind.</i>

00:57:31.417 --> 00:57:34.621
<i>To open the restaurant
and make it successful.</i>

00:57:38.049 --> 00:57:43.174
Short stack. Easy on the butter.
Adam and Eve on a raft. Hit me hard.

00:57:43.346 --> 00:57:46.680
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- We'll come again tomorrow.

00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:48.972
See you tomorrow. Good night.

00:57:51.396 --> 00:57:53.519
Too bad you had to stand so long.

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:56.691
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting.
This way.

00:57:56.859 --> 00:57:58.899
I'm so glad you liked it.

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:03.198
We've been jammed ever since the doors
opened. Here you are.

00:58:03.366 --> 00:58:04.944
Arline, take the orders.

00:58:05.118 --> 00:58:07.525
- We have great fried chicken.
- I'll have it.

00:58:07.704 --> 00:58:09.364
I hope you like it.

00:58:10.748 --> 00:58:14.793
Pick up something. Never make a trip
with an empty tray like that.

00:58:14.961 --> 00:58:18.211
- It looks like we're in.
- That's what it says here.

00:58:18.381 --> 00:58:21.002
- Isn't that lovely?
- What would I do without you?

00:58:21.175 --> 00:58:23.334
Probably have a nervous breakdown.

00:58:23.511 --> 00:58:26.714
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello. We got your invitation.

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:30.970
I'm glad you came. Suzanne,
a booth for Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer.

00:58:31.144 --> 00:58:33.765
- Congratulations, Mother.
- Thank you.

00:58:33.938 --> 00:58:37.188
- How'd you like to sell?
- No. I know a good thing when I see it.

00:58:37.358 --> 00:58:41.403
So do I. It's some mob.
Those postcards you sent out did the trick.

00:58:41.571 --> 00:58:45.569
Keep my seat and get me a drink.
I want to talk to your mother.

00:58:45.742 --> 00:58:49.822
- What do you want to talk to me about?
- It's about Bert. He's coming here tonight.

00:58:49.996 --> 00:58:53.579
- He is?
- He wants to see you about the divorce.

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:56.501
- What about it?
- He just wants to see you.

00:58:56.669 --> 00:59:00.584
- Help me. I gotta go to the kitchen.
- All right, sure.

00:59:00.757 --> 00:59:03.544
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- You big peasant.

00:59:03.718 --> 00:59:07.882
- Look where you're going.
- Excuse me for living. I'm excited.

00:59:08.056 --> 00:59:10.629
- What's this?
- We're swamped. Help us.

00:59:10.808 --> 00:59:15.102
- Who me? I'm an executive.
- Now you're VP in charge of the potatoes.

00:59:15.271 --> 00:59:16.552
- All right.
- Thanks.

00:59:16.731 --> 00:59:18.807
- You look very pretty.
- Thank you.

00:59:18.983 --> 00:59:20.394
Not at all.

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:29.488
What do you know?
Beragon just came in.

00:59:29.661 --> 00:59:33.279
- Did he? He didn't say he was coming.
- What do you mean?

00:59:33.456 --> 00:59:36.706
- You been seeing him?
- Don't let the potatoes burn.

00:59:36.876 --> 00:59:38.157
I was just asking.

00:59:38.336 --> 00:59:41.622
Don't ever go in like that.
Put more potatoes on.

00:59:41.798 --> 00:59:45.878
- You'll never make money that way.
- Just so the customers are satisfied.

00:59:46.052 --> 00:59:49.919
This is just like my wedding night.
So exciting.

00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:55.811
- Will you give Mrs. Pierce these?
- Can I tell her your name or is it secret?

00:59:55.979 --> 00:59:57.971
Tell her they're from
an old gypsy fortuneteller.

00:59:58.147 --> 01:00:02.809
Oh. Well, sit down and read a teacup,
and I'll see if she's busy.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.734
- Hey, Mildred! Real, live orchids.
- For me?

01:00:08.908 --> 01:00:11.482
Orchids? What is this?
Who they from?

01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:14.697
From an old gypsy fortuneteller
with beautiful eyes.

01:00:14.873 --> 01:00:17.957
- Beg pardon?
- Put them in the icebox, Wally.

01:00:18.126 --> 01:00:19.869
Here, muscles.

01:00:31.931 --> 01:00:34.505
Put it on this table, please?

01:00:34.684 --> 01:00:37.601
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize this table was taken.

01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:42.017
It's quite all right. We're so crowded
tonight. Do sit down, Mr. Beragon.

01:00:42.191 --> 01:00:44.813
Thank you. May I have a dry martini?

01:00:44.986 --> 01:00:48.319
- So you know me?
- Everyone knows the Monte Beragon.

01:00:48.489 --> 01:00:51.277
You play polo, go yachting,
are an excellent hunter.

01:00:51.451 --> 01:00:54.571
And are seen with the most
attractive debutantes.

01:00:54.746 --> 01:00:56.869
- I read the society section.
- I gather.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.872
- I should introduce myself.
- Don't tell me. Your hand, please.

01:01:01.044 --> 01:01:03.713
- Can you tell from my hand?
- I wouldn't want this to get around...

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.919
...but I come from a long line
of fortunetellers.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:08.581
- Oh?
- Oh, yes.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.045
- What does it say?
- That you are very much like your mother.

01:01:12.222 --> 01:01:14.463
- Yes?
- And it says that her name is Bierce.

01:01:14.641 --> 01:01:16.680
No. Pierce.

01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:19.935
- How wonderful.
- And it says your name is Veda.

01:01:20.104 --> 01:01:25.691
- Where does it say "Veda"?
- That line right there. Unmistakable.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.980
- Well, if it isn't Gypsy Beragon.
- The very same.

01:01:29.155 --> 01:01:33.449
- It looks like a good investment, huh?
- Anything would be an improvement.

01:01:33.618 --> 01:01:36.868
Smile when you say that,
a third of this joint belongs to me.

01:01:37.038 --> 01:01:39.659
- Congratulations.
- I've got another proposition.

01:01:39.832 --> 01:01:42.074
- That orange grove you got-
- Save it until later.

01:01:42.252 --> 01:01:44.540
- Well, here's to success.
- Yes.

01:01:44.712 --> 01:01:45.792
Thank you.

01:01:45.964 --> 01:01:46.995
Four. Half-and-half.

01:01:47.173 --> 01:01:48.917
Two special. One Grade A. One black.

01:01:49.092 --> 01:01:51.879
Hot stuff coming through.

01:02:00.395 --> 01:02:01.853
That's a wonderful piece.

01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:06.814
- All you need is a pair of bobby socks.
- Maybe Veda will lend me a pair.

01:02:12.991 --> 01:02:16.110
Well, the last customer
just folded his tent.

01:02:16.286 --> 01:02:19.951
- Good. We've only got one chicken left.
- Put my initials on that.

01:02:20.123 --> 01:02:23.326
I don't know whether
I'm on my feet or my ankles.

01:02:23.501 --> 01:02:28.459
- You must be dead.
- Well, if I am, just bury me with this.

01:02:28.631 --> 01:02:30.540
I wish I felt the way they do.

01:02:34.178 --> 01:02:38.472
- You've got a nice voice. Did you know?
- Thank you.

01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:41.311
Hi. Congratulations. You're a success.

01:02:41.477 --> 01:02:45.143
We've been getting acquainted.
- He's promised to take me the races.

01:02:45.315 --> 01:02:47.224
- lf your mother comes too.
- I'd love to.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.440
- Wally, do me a favor.
- Anything.

01:02:49.611 --> 01:02:51.153
- Take Veda home.
- What?

01:02:51.321 --> 01:02:54.654
- Anyone would think I was a child.
- You are. It's past your bedtime.

01:02:54.824 --> 01:02:58.988
It's not past my bedtime.
Besides, I want to take you home.

01:02:59.162 --> 01:03:01.997
I've got to close up.
I'll go home with Ida.

01:03:02.165 --> 01:03:06.079
Sure is a big night for me.
I came out for an evening of fun.

01:03:06.252 --> 01:03:10.167
What do I get? Dishpan hands
and a date with a Girl Scout.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.297
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:03:12.467 --> 01:03:15.337
Good night, Mr. Beragon.
Thank you for everything.

01:03:15.511 --> 01:03:18.678
- I trust that we may meet again very soon.
- I hope so.

01:03:18.848 --> 01:03:24.269
Thank you, Mrs. Pierce. I trust that I might
see you in the not-too-distant future.

01:03:24.437 --> 01:03:25.812
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.471
Come on. Never mind. Hurry up.

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:31.354
For heaven's sake.

01:03:33.238 --> 01:03:35.526
Leave something on me.
I might catch cold.

01:03:35.698 --> 01:03:40.159
I was just thinking.
Not about you. Come on.

01:03:40.495 --> 01:03:42.784
- That's a cute youngster of yours.
- Isn't she?

01:03:42.956 --> 01:03:45.625
I thought you had two.

01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:49.540
- Kay died.
- I'm sorry. You should have let me know.

01:03:49.712 --> 01:03:52.203
- Let's not talk about it.
- You've had tough breaks...

01:03:52.382 --> 01:03:54.505
...but you're going to make a go
of this place.

01:03:54.676 --> 01:03:56.134
Well, I hope so.

01:03:56.302 --> 01:03:59.802
- Don't you ever do anything but work?
- Somebody's got to.

01:03:59.973 --> 01:04:03.805
Not all the time. There's a time
for work and a time for-

01:04:03.977 --> 01:04:08.555
Seventeen. Six minus seven.
Monte, don't. Not here.

01:04:08.731 --> 01:04:13.524
Why not? I've been waiting
all evening. A lifetime.

01:04:28.418 --> 01:04:31.668
I didn't mean to bust in like this.
- That's all right.

01:04:31.838 --> 01:04:35.752
This is my husband.
Mr. Beragon, Monte Beragon.

01:04:35.925 --> 01:04:39.128
- I've heard a lot of things about you.
- Nice things, I hope.

01:04:39.304 --> 01:04:42.720
- I'd like to speak to Mildred.
- Yes, of course.

01:04:42.891 --> 01:04:46.509
- What is it, Bert?
- This'll only take a minute.

01:04:47.478 --> 01:04:50.729
It's funny. It's harder
to say than I thought.

01:04:50.899 --> 01:04:53.935
It's about the divorce.
You can have it.

01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:57.609
When I walked out, I told you
to see if you could get along without me.

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:01.232
I didn't think you could.
When you asked me for a divorce...

01:05:01.409 --> 01:05:04.659
...I still didn't think you
could make a go of it alone.

01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:07.403
Now I know better.
You're doing all right.

01:05:07.582 --> 01:05:10.867
- You're doing fine.
- I never thought it would end like this.

01:05:11.044 --> 01:05:13.332
Who knows how anything
is going to end?

01:05:13.671 --> 01:05:16.957
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, I'm sorry too.

01:05:17.133 --> 01:05:21.047
Well, that's what I came
to say, and now that I've said it...

01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:24.969
...I want you to know I wish you
all the luck in the world.

01:05:25.141 --> 01:05:27.347
Thank you, Bert. Thank you.

01:05:27.518 --> 01:05:29.476
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:05:29.646 --> 01:05:31.722
This calls for a drink.

01:05:31.898 --> 01:05:35.267
In the Beragon family,
there is an old Spanish proverb:

01:05:35.443 --> 01:05:38.016
One man's poison
is another man's meat.

01:05:39.405 --> 01:05:40.485
Bert!

01:05:54.254 --> 01:05:57.587
I was in love with him, and I knew it
for the first time that night...

01:05:57.757 --> 01:06:01.671
...but now he's dead, and I'm not sorry.
He wasn't worth it.

01:06:01.844 --> 01:06:05.628
That may be. Whoever killed him
evidently agreed with you.

01:06:05.807 --> 01:06:09.851
But you haven't given us one reason why
your first husband wasn't the murderer.

01:06:10.019 --> 01:06:12.854
In fact, you've given us
a very good reason why he was.

01:06:13.022 --> 01:06:17.067
Look at it our way. One, Beragon
was killed with Pierce's gun.

01:06:17.235 --> 01:06:21.149
Two, Pierce cannot account for
his movements at the time of the murder.

01:06:21.322 --> 01:06:27.740
Three, he had a motive. You've just
given it to us, Mrs. Beragon. Jealousy.

01:06:27.912 --> 01:06:30.368
This just came in.
Thought you'd want it.

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:33.660
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

01:06:36.379 --> 01:06:40.708
- Is he sure?
- Charley don't like to make mistakes.

01:06:40.884 --> 01:06:42.876
Just a minute.

01:06:43.052 --> 01:06:47.264
Mrs. Beragon, we have some
information here which puzzles us a little.

01:06:47.807 --> 01:06:51.675
For instance, your business manager....

01:06:51.853 --> 01:06:54.854
- Right away.
- Okay.

01:06:55.023 --> 01:06:59.815
Ida Corwin. She tells us that you
called her at approximately 11:45 p. m...

01:06:59.986 --> 01:07:02.228
...and asked her where Mr. Beragon was.

01:07:02.405 --> 01:07:06.948
- You seemed quite upset at the time.
- It was just a business matter.

01:07:07.118 --> 01:07:10.569
- Then there was nothing wrong?
- No.

01:07:10.747 --> 01:07:14.412
Occasionally we run across
a witness who refuses to tell us...

01:07:14.584 --> 01:07:19.958
...what we want to know, except under
pressure. Like Wally Fay, for example.

01:07:20.131 --> 01:07:24.460
Why did you take him to the beach house?
Did you know Beragon was there, dead?

01:07:24.636 --> 01:07:27.672
- No, I didn't.
- Then you were at the beach house.

01:07:27.847 --> 01:07:31.596
Why didn't you tell us that before?
Why did you run from the house?

01:07:31.768 --> 01:07:34.638
Wasn't it because you
knew Beragon was there, dead?

01:07:34.812 --> 01:07:39.640
And if you did know, why were you
trying to pin the murder onto Fay? Why?

01:07:40.193 --> 01:07:43.360
I think you'd better
tell us the truth now.

01:07:46.115 --> 01:07:47.610
I did it.

01:07:47.784 --> 01:07:48.946
I killed him.

01:07:49.118 --> 01:07:54.742
But why? Your restaurant was a success.
You were in love with Beragon.

01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:58.578
What happened to all that?

01:07:58.753 --> 01:08:03.629
The restaurant was a greater success
than I knew. Profits were enormous.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.299
In a few months I opened another place,
and then I started a chain.

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:09.878
<i>In three years I built five restaurants.</i>

01:08:10.056 --> 01:08:13.639
<i>Everywhere you went,
I had a restaurant. They made money.</i>

01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:18.970
<i>Everything I touched turned into money,
and I needed it. I needed it for Veda.</i>

01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:26.902
<i>She was becoming a young lady
with expensive tastes.</i>

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.992
<i>Veda was growing up.</i>

01:08:48.136 --> 01:08:51.469
That Ted Forrester is nice-looking.
Veda likes him.

01:08:51.639 --> 01:08:53.846
Who wouldn't?
He has a million dollars.

01:08:54.017 --> 01:08:58.014
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I've just run out of jokes.

01:08:58.187 --> 01:09:01.521
- What is it? Tell me.
- I've had a little bad luck lately.

01:09:01.691 --> 01:09:05.356
I won't be able to afford
many more evenings like this.

01:09:05.528 --> 01:09:09.442
- Do you need money?
- No, no. It isn't anything like that.

01:09:09.616 --> 01:09:14.076
- I think you do.
- Mildred, please don't do that.

01:09:14.245 --> 01:09:17.994
You've been awfully good to us, Monte.
Take it, please.

01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:23.504
If you say so. But I'll pay it back.
I want it understood that it's only a loan.

01:09:23.671 --> 01:09:27.539
Anything you say,
just as long as we're friends.

01:09:31.054 --> 01:09:35.763
<i>That's how it began. At first it
bothered Monte to take money from me.</i>

01:09:35.934 --> 01:09:39.100
<i>Then it became a habit with him.</i>

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:42.687
There's a total here
of $ 1480.29 in six months.

01:09:42.857 --> 01:09:44.814
- What's the big idea?
- We owe him a great deal.

01:09:44.984 --> 01:09:47.654
The restaurant's paid for.
You don't owe him a cent.

01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:50.656
I manage this business,
and I've done all right.

01:09:50.823 --> 01:09:53.694
Keeping Beragon in shirts
is not my idea of business.

01:09:53.868 --> 01:09:55.031
- No?
- No!

01:09:55.203 --> 01:09:57.955
Look, I made this business for you
with my own hands.

01:09:58.122 --> 01:10:00.411
I got banks to give you credit.
That wasn't easy.

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:04.415
I conned everybody, and for what? So you
could have a lap dog named Beragon?

01:10:04.587 --> 01:10:06.876
- Take it easy, Wally.
- When you walked out on Bert...

01:10:07.048 --> 01:10:08.791
...I was glad to see you get some sense.

01:10:08.967 --> 01:10:12.170
- Beragon's worse.
- That's none of your business.

01:10:12.345 --> 01:10:18.715
It is. I helped you so I'd be around when
your mind changed. Maybe I was wrong.

01:10:18.893 --> 01:10:22.808
- Maybe you were.
- Beragon is no good. He'll bleed you dry.

01:10:23.398 --> 01:10:26.185
Suppose I'm in love with him.

01:10:29.237 --> 01:10:30.945
Huh.

01:10:31.114 --> 01:10:32.905
Okay.

01:10:33.074 --> 01:10:36.360
- At least now I know where I stand.
- That's right. Now you know.

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:44.826
- I hate all women.
- My, my.

01:10:45.003 --> 01:10:48.039
Thank goodness you're not one.

01:10:48.673 --> 01:10:51.627
Laughing boy seems burned
at the edges. What's eating him?

01:10:51.801 --> 01:10:53.877
- A small, green-eyed monster.
- Jealous?

01:10:54.053 --> 01:10:58.300
Doesn't sound like Wally. No profit in it,
and that boy loves a dollar.

01:10:58.474 --> 01:11:02.721
- I told him I was in love with Beragon.
- Are you?

01:11:02.896 --> 01:11:05.896
I thought I was once, but not now.

01:11:06.274 --> 01:11:07.602
Good.

01:11:07.775 --> 01:11:10.812
- What's that?
- A $ 1800 birthday present for Veda.

01:11:10.987 --> 01:11:16.278
- The car. It's here. Where is it?
- It's that shiny thing a block long.

01:11:19.662 --> 01:11:23.031
- Do you think she'll like it?
- lf she doesn't, have her head examined.

01:11:23.208 --> 01:11:26.908
Here, you have to sign this in blood.

01:11:27.462 --> 01:11:30.665
- It isn't any of my business-
- lf it's about Monte, I agree.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.963
It's Veda.
She's been borrowing money.

01:11:33.343 --> 01:11:36.178
- From whom?
- Anybody. Waitresses mostly.

01:11:36.346 --> 01:11:38.504
Hasn't she paid them back?

01:11:38.681 --> 01:11:43.177
They're afraid to say anything
or turn her down. You know how it is.

01:11:43.436 --> 01:11:45.761
Tell them to come to me.
I'll see that they're paid.

01:11:45.939 --> 01:11:48.856
I'm sorry I had to tell you.
I don't blame her much.

01:11:49.025 --> 01:11:50.140
Monte was with her-

01:11:50.318 --> 01:11:53.604
Did you bring the Laguna Beach
and Los Feliz statements?

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.318
Yeah. They're over here.

01:11:57.367 --> 01:11:58.991
- Hello, everybody!
- Hello.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.283
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello Veda, Monte.

01:12:01.454 --> 01:12:03.945
I hope we aren't interrupting
a big conference.

01:12:04.123 --> 01:12:07.457
- Just a teeny one.
- I wish I could get interested in work.

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:11.375
You were probably frightened
by a callus at an early age. I'll take that.

01:12:11.548 --> 01:12:14.881
- Thank you.
- One missing.

01:12:15.051 --> 01:12:17.624
You're sitting on
the Laguna Beach statement!

01:12:17.804 --> 01:12:21.220
That's what I like about you.
You're so delightfully provincial.

01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:25.720
I like you too. Don't look now,
but you're standing under a brick wall.

01:12:25.895 --> 01:12:30.225
- I don't get it.
- You will, when it falls on you.

01:12:32.902 --> 01:12:37.611
- When did you start smoking?
- Just the other day.

01:12:37.782 --> 01:12:41.910
Monte gave me this for my birthday.
I couldn't hurt him by not using it.

01:12:42.078 --> 01:12:47.036
<i>I mean, that would have been dreadfully
recherché, n 'est-ce pas?</i>

01:12:47.417 --> 01:12:50.086
Yes, I suppose so.

01:12:50.253 --> 01:12:53.207
Here's something for your birthday too.
I hope you like it.

01:12:53.381 --> 01:12:58.209
- Mother! A car? Where is it?
- Look out the window.

01:13:01.264 --> 01:13:05.309
- Mother, it's beautiful.
- I'm so glad you like it.

01:13:05.476 --> 01:13:07.849
How about me?
After all, I picked it out.

01:13:08.021 --> 01:13:11.271
Monte, it's the nicest present
I ever got.

01:13:11.441 --> 01:13:15.141
- You're sweet. Let's go for a drive.
- Nothing I'd like better.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.237
- Do you mind? I'd like to talk to you.
- Not at all.

01:13:18.406 --> 01:13:20.482
- Run along and dent your fenders.
- All right.

01:13:20.658 --> 01:13:22.947
See you later at the club.
Be careful.

01:13:23.119 --> 01:13:24.661
I will.

01:13:36.049 --> 01:13:37.591
Bye.

01:13:52.815 --> 01:13:56.315
- What's the matter?
- I want you to do me a favor.

01:13:56.486 --> 01:13:58.941
- Sure. What?
- Stay away from Veda.

01:13:59.113 --> 01:14:01.651
What's the matter with me?
Have I sprouted two heads?

01:14:01.824 --> 01:14:04.778
I just don't want you
to take her out so much, that's all.

01:14:04.953 --> 01:14:07.740
And it isn't funny.
She's only 17 and spoiled rotten.

01:14:07.914 --> 01:14:10.749
- What has that got to do with me?
- Look, I've worked long and hard...

01:14:10.917 --> 01:14:13.040
...to give Veda the things I never had.

01:14:13.211 --> 01:14:18.288
I've done without a lot of things
because I wanted her to have everything.

01:14:18.466 --> 01:14:20.008
Now I'm losing her.

01:14:20.176 --> 01:14:22.169
She's drifting away from me.

01:14:22.345 --> 01:14:24.717
She hardly speaks to me
except to ask for money...

01:14:24.889 --> 01:14:27.261
...or poke fun at me
because I work for a living.

01:14:27.433 --> 01:14:30.470
- All kids are thoughtless.
- Perhaps. I still don't like it.

01:14:30.645 --> 01:14:32.684
I blame it on the way she's living.
And you.

01:14:32.855 --> 01:14:36.355
I don't think you understand Veda
very well. She's not like you.

01:14:36.526 --> 01:14:39.693
You'll never make a waitress
out of her.

01:14:39.862 --> 01:14:43.860
You look down on me because
I work for a living, don't you?

01:14:44.033 --> 01:14:47.782
All right, I work. I cook food,
sell it and make a profit...

01:14:47.954 --> 01:14:50.623
...which you're not too proud to share.

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:52.699
Yes, I take money from you...

01:14:52.876 --> 01:14:57.122
...but not enough to make me like
kitchens or cooks. They smell of grease.

01:14:57.297 --> 01:15:00.879
You don't shrink away from a $50 bill
because it smells of grease.

01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:03.720
- Take it easy.
- There's no point in going on like this.

01:15:03.887 --> 01:15:06.045
You're interfering with my life
and business.

01:15:06.222 --> 01:15:09.389
Worst of all, you're interfering
with my plans for Veda.

01:15:09.559 --> 01:15:13.722
I always knew that someday
we'd come to this particular moment.

01:15:13.897 --> 01:15:16.767
You want Veda and your business
and a nice, quiet life.

01:15:16.941 --> 01:15:19.183
And the price of all that is me.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.903
You can go back to making your pies
now, Mildred. We're through.

01:15:24.073 --> 01:15:27.323
Wait a minute, Monte.
I forgot something.

01:15:33.917 --> 01:15:37.866
You've been very good to us. I know
you've had expenses taking Veda out.

01:15:38.046 --> 01:15:41.249
I don't know how much
we owe you, but....

01:15:41.424 --> 01:15:44.793
If that isn't enough,
you can let me know.

01:15:44.969 --> 01:15:48.837
Thank you. I've always wondered
how it felt to take a tip.

01:15:49.015 --> 01:15:50.806
Well, now you know.

01:15:51.309 --> 01:15:54.760
You can mark
our account "paid in full. "

01:16:07.116 --> 01:16:10.034
- I'd like some of that.
- You gotta work for it.

01:16:10.203 --> 01:16:13.370
Keep your motor running.
Bring me three glasses, will you?

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:16.624
- This is beginning to look serious.
- It is.

01:16:16.793 --> 01:16:20.625
- Yes, we finally made up our minds.
- This calls for a celebration.

01:16:20.797 --> 01:16:23.667
- Congratulations, Romeo.
- You've been swell to us.

01:16:23.841 --> 01:16:26.167
I get a kick out of doing
things for people.

01:16:26.344 --> 01:16:28.301
- Don't I, Veda?
- Absolutely.

01:16:28.471 --> 01:16:32.220
Looks like we never serve
champagne in this joint. Or place.

01:16:32.392 --> 01:16:36.852
Try this on for size. It's our very best,
reserved for special customers.

01:16:37.021 --> 01:16:40.141
California, '42.

01:16:40.567 --> 01:16:43.484
Well, here's to....

01:16:43.653 --> 01:16:45.562
Here's to true love.

01:16:45.738 --> 01:16:48.360
To true love.

01:16:54.247 --> 01:16:59.288
The receipts at Arcadia have dropped
roughly 7 percent during the last month.

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.038
- Say, Mildred.
- Nearly 8 percent.

01:17:01.212 --> 01:17:04.166
There's a Mrs. Forrester
waiting to see you.

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:06.914
- Oh, what about?
- Veda.

01:17:07.093 --> 01:17:11.091
- Excuse me, Mr. Jones.
- Do you always interrupt?

01:17:11.306 --> 01:17:13.512
Only because I want
to be alone with you.

01:17:13.683 --> 01:17:16.055
Come here and let me bite you,
you darling boy.

01:17:20.273 --> 01:17:21.518
- Mrs. Pierce?
- Yes.

01:17:21.691 --> 01:17:24.941
- I'm Mrs. Forrester. Ted's mother.
- How do you do?

01:17:25.111 --> 01:17:27.780
Won't you come sit down, it would be
more comfortable.

01:17:27.947 --> 01:17:31.447
I've been looking forward
to meeting you, Mrs. Pierce.

01:17:31.618 --> 01:17:34.572
I'm sure we're going
to work out our problem splendidly.

01:17:34.746 --> 01:17:37.284
- Little problem?
- Veda hasn't told you?

01:17:37.457 --> 01:17:39.699
Told me what?

01:17:39.876 --> 01:17:43.245
Your daughter has somehow
got the idea that-

01:17:43.421 --> 01:17:46.588
I understand it.
Any girl wants to get married.

01:17:46.966 --> 01:17:50.631
Ted had no such thing in mind.
I want that made clear.

01:17:50.803 --> 01:17:53.010
You mean they're engaged,
Veda and Ted?

01:17:53.181 --> 01:17:56.098
Yes. I'm quite sure you'll agree with me...

01:17:56.267 --> 01:18:00.894
...that any discussion of marriage
between them would be most undesirable.

01:18:01.064 --> 01:18:04.812
Why should Veda want to marry
your son if he doesn't want to marry her?

01:18:04.984 --> 01:18:07.689
I'm not a mind reader,
but let me tell you...

01:18:07.862 --> 01:18:11.646
...if this girl employs any more tricks
trying to blackmail my son-

01:18:11.824 --> 01:18:14.695
- Trying to what?
- Understand me, Mrs. Pierce.

01:18:14.869 --> 01:18:18.369
I shall prevent this marriage
in any way that I can.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.746
I don't think you need worry.

01:18:20.917 --> 01:18:26.208
Having you in my family is a pretty
dismal prospect. Good afternoon.

01:18:34.889 --> 01:18:36.218
Veda, I want to talk to you.

01:18:36.391 --> 01:18:37.968
- Hi, Mildred.
- Hello, Wally.

01:18:38.142 --> 01:18:42.721
- What about?
- Mrs. Forrester came to see me today.

01:18:42.897 --> 01:18:46.729
- Wally, this is private.
- That's all right. Wally knows about it.

01:18:46.901 --> 01:18:49.060
He knows you and Ted
want to get married?

01:18:49.529 --> 01:18:52.067
Want to get married?

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:55.940
We are married.
We were married on my birthday.

01:18:56.119 --> 01:18:59.903
- I'm sorry, but it's done.
- Veda was trying to spare you.

01:19:00.081 --> 01:19:03.331
She wanted to make things easier
for you so she asked me to help.

01:19:03.501 --> 01:19:07.250
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to so many times.

01:19:07.422 --> 01:19:12.760
But you seemed so far away.
I couldn't somehow. I was afraid.

01:19:13.636 --> 01:19:17.385
- Afraid of your own mother?
- Mother, I've been so miserable.

01:19:18.099 --> 01:19:21.883
I made a mistake,
and I didn't know how to tell you.

01:19:23.813 --> 01:19:28.392
Darling, don't you love Ted?

01:19:30.737 --> 01:19:32.979
No, Mother.

01:19:34.991 --> 01:19:37.363
I'm sorry about that, Veda.

01:19:37.535 --> 01:19:40.287
But maybe we don't belong
in a family like that.

01:19:40.455 --> 01:19:44.499
That's right. Veda doesn't love this boy.
All right, so she made a mistake.

01:19:44.667 --> 01:19:46.956
The thing to do is
to settle the case out of court.

01:19:47.128 --> 01:19:50.996
- That's the clean way to handle it.
- All right.

01:19:51.841 --> 01:19:55.709
"I, hereby, of my own free will,
renounce all right and title...

01:19:55.887 --> 01:20:00.348
...that I, or my heirs and assignees,
may have to any moneys or estate...

01:20:00.516 --> 01:20:05.593
...real or otherwise, which will accrue
or evolve to Theodore Forrester...

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:09.349
...in exchange for considerations
of value received. "

01:20:10.485 --> 01:20:13.854
- Are you agreeable to this?
- Why can't we stay married?

01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:16.865
- You will be good enough to keep quiet.
- Yes, Mother.

01:20:17.033 --> 01:20:18.990
We can assume the waiver
is acceptable.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:22.363
- Will you sign this, please?
- Yeah, sure. Glad to.

01:20:22.539 --> 01:20:26.322
My client feels, and I am in complete
accord with her, that she has been irrep....

01:20:26.501 --> 01:20:29.834
- Uh....
- Irreparably?

01:20:30.004 --> 01:20:32.211
Unduly damaged.

01:20:32.382 --> 01:20:35.217
Therefore, there's one more formality
we should discuss.

01:20:35.385 --> 01:20:37.627
- What's that?
- The financial settlement.

01:20:37.804 --> 01:20:40.093
You see, my client would like $ 10,000.

01:20:40.932 --> 01:20:46.353
I think I'm safe in observing that
almost anyone would like $ 10,000, but....

01:20:46.521 --> 01:20:47.600
But...?

01:20:47.772 --> 01:20:51.271
We see no necessity
for a financial settlement of any kind.

01:20:51.442 --> 01:20:52.901
- You don't, huh?
- No.

01:20:53.069 --> 01:20:55.738
- You will.
- I doubt it.

01:20:55.905 --> 01:21:00.366
I don't understand all this.
There's no need for a financial settlement.

01:21:00.535 --> 01:21:03.785
- The only thing we're interested in-
- Please, Mother.

01:21:03.955 --> 01:21:07.406
I need the money.
I have to think of the future.

01:21:07.584 --> 01:21:10.371
That's right.
- I'm going to have a baby.

01:21:10.545 --> 01:21:12.454
- What?
- What?

01:21:13.006 --> 01:21:15.082
Veda.

01:21:15.592 --> 01:21:19.007
You see, $ 10,000
is not entirely unreasonable.

01:21:19.178 --> 01:21:23.307
- This is moral blackmail, sir.
- That's no way to talk about a baby.

01:21:23.474 --> 01:21:26.808
- I won't pay it.
- Yes, you will. Ask your lawyer.

01:21:26.978 --> 01:21:28.852
Yes?

01:21:29.522 --> 01:21:31.562
- Yes.
- I guess that's about all.

01:21:31.733 --> 01:21:35.267
You can make out the check
to Mrs. Forr- To....

01:21:35.612 --> 01:21:38.648
Miss Veda Pierce.

01:21:39.198 --> 01:21:42.235
Well, that's that.

01:21:44.204 --> 01:21:48.949
I'm sorry this had to happen.
Sorry for the boy. He seemed very nice.

01:21:49.125 --> 01:21:51.960
Oh, Ted's all right, really.

01:21:52.128 --> 01:21:56.790
Did you see the look on his face when
we told him he was going to be a father?

01:21:56.966 --> 01:22:00.466
- I wish you wouldn't joke about it.
- Mother, you're a scream.

01:22:00.637 --> 01:22:05.548
- Next you'll be knitting little garments.
- I don't see anything ridiculous about that.

01:22:05.725 --> 01:22:09.426
If I were you, I'd save
myself the trouble.

01:22:15.235 --> 01:22:18.983
- You're not going to have a baby?
- At this stage, it's a matter of opinion.

01:22:19.155 --> 01:22:23.651
In my opinion, I'm going to have
a baby. I can always be mistaken.

01:22:23.826 --> 01:22:28.038
- How could you do such a thing?
- I got the money, didn't I?

01:22:28.206 --> 01:22:29.320
I see.

01:22:29.499 --> 01:22:33.164
I'll have to give Wally part of it
to keep him quiet, but there's enough.

01:22:33.336 --> 01:22:36.005
Money. That's what
you live for, isn't it?

01:22:36.172 --> 01:22:38.924
You'd do anything for money.
Even blackmail.

01:22:39.092 --> 01:22:41.334
- Grow up.
- I've never denied you anything.

01:22:41.511 --> 01:22:45.674
Anything money could buy, I've given you.
But that wasn't enough, was it?

01:22:45.848 --> 01:22:47.971
From now on,
things are going to be different.

01:22:48.142 --> 01:22:51.393
I'll say they are. Why do you think
I went to all this trouble?

01:22:51.563 --> 01:22:53.472
Why do you think
I want money so badly?

01:22:53.731 --> 01:22:55.356
All right, why?

01:22:55.525 --> 01:22:58.230
- Are you sure you want to know?
- Yes.

01:22:58.403 --> 01:23:02.352
Then I'll tell you. With this money,
I can get away from you.

01:23:02.991 --> 01:23:04.070
Veda.

01:23:04.242 --> 01:23:08.820
From you and your chickens, pies and
kitchens. Everything that smells of grease.

01:23:08.997 --> 01:23:12.864
I can get away from this shack
and its cheap furniture. And this town....

01:23:13.042 --> 01:23:16.209
Its women that wear uniforms.
Its men that wear overalls.

01:23:16.379 --> 01:23:19.962
I think I'm seeing you for the first time
in my life. You're cheap and horrible.

01:23:20.133 --> 01:23:22.884
You think just because you made money,
you can get a new hairdo...

01:23:23.052 --> 01:23:25.543
...and some expensive clothes
and turn yourself into a lady.

01:23:25.722 --> 01:23:29.554
But you can't. You'll never be
anything but a common frump...

01:23:29.726 --> 01:23:33.344
...whose father lived over a store
and whose mother took in washing.

01:23:33.521 --> 01:23:36.522
With this money I can get away
from every rotten thing...

01:23:36.691 --> 01:23:39.063
...that makes me think
of this place or you!

01:23:40.528 --> 01:23:42.070
Veda!

01:23:44.407 --> 01:23:48.321
- Give me that check! I said give it to me!
- Not on your life!

01:23:57.545 --> 01:23:59.787
Get out, Veda.

01:23:59.964 --> 01:24:04.543
Get your things out of this house
before I throw them into the street.

01:24:04.719 --> 01:24:06.462
Get out before I kill you.

01:24:21.194 --> 01:24:25.607
<i>I went away for a while.
I traveled, but not far enough.</i>

01:24:25.782 --> 01:24:28.487
<i>Something kept pulling me back.</i>

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.954
<i>Finally, I gave in. I went home.</i>

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:41.837
Why, Miss Pierce, this is a day
for rejoicing. It certainly is.

01:24:42.006 --> 01:24:44.295
- How are you?
- You look wonderful.

01:24:44.467 --> 01:24:46.590
- Thank you.
- You been away so long.

01:24:46.761 --> 01:24:49.334
- I've been to Mexico.
- Is that a fact?

01:24:49.514 --> 01:24:53.179
I don't know what we would have
done if you'd stayed away longer.

01:24:53.351 --> 01:24:56.886
- Thank you. It's nice to see you too.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

01:24:57.355 --> 01:24:59.312
- Welcome home.
- Thank you. Hi, Ida.

01:24:59.482 --> 01:25:02.103
- Well, long time no see.
- How are you?

01:25:02.277 --> 01:25:03.475
- How was Mexico?
- Crowded.

01:25:03.653 --> 01:25:04.768
- How's business?
- Crowded.

01:25:04.946 --> 01:25:08.279
- You want your desk back?
- No, thanks. On you, it looks good.

01:25:08.866 --> 01:25:12.734
You know, I like Mexico.
It's so Mexican. Thanks.

01:25:12.912 --> 01:25:14.323
Here.

01:25:16.124 --> 01:25:17.951
You're in great shape.

01:25:18.126 --> 01:25:21.162
There's nothing
like a nice, long rest, is there?

01:25:21.337 --> 01:25:24.089
- Got a drink handy?
- Yeah. I guess so.

01:25:24.257 --> 01:25:27.792
Gene, crack open the safe
and get out some of that good bourbon.

01:25:27.969 --> 01:25:31.302
- You never used to drink during the day.
- I never used to drink at all.

01:25:31.472 --> 01:25:34.557
- It's a habit I picked up from men.
- Oh, men.

01:25:34.726 --> 01:25:38.011
I never yet met one who didn't
have the instincts of a heel.

01:25:38.187 --> 01:25:40.975
Sometimes I wish I could
get along without them.

01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:42.726
You've never been married, have you?

01:25:42.901 --> 01:25:46.186
No. When men get around me,
they get allergic to wedding rings.

01:25:46.362 --> 01:25:49.363
You know, big-sister type.
"Good old Ida...

01:25:49.532 --> 01:25:52.367
...you can talk it over
with her, man-to-man! "

01:25:52.535 --> 01:25:55.157
I'm getting tired of men talking
to me "man-to-man. "

01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:58.663
- I think I'll have a drink myself.
- I'll take mine straight.

01:25:58.833 --> 01:26:01.870
Well, if you can take it, I can.

01:26:06.216 --> 01:26:08.541
- Seen anyone I know lately?
- You mean Veda.

01:26:08.718 --> 01:26:11.719
I wondered how long it would take you
to get to that.

01:26:11.888 --> 01:26:15.221
Yes, I mean Veda. Have you seen her?
Is she all right?

01:26:15.391 --> 01:26:19.721
- Why don't you forget about her?
- I can't. I've tried, but I can't.

01:26:19.896 --> 01:26:22.434
Well, try, try again. That's my motto.

01:26:22.941 --> 01:26:27.437
You don't know what it's like being
a mother, Ida. Veda's a part of me.

01:26:27.612 --> 01:26:30.897
Maybe she didn't turn out as well
as I hoped she would...

01:26:31.074 --> 01:26:33.991
...but she's still my daughter,
and I can't forget that.

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.912
I went away to try. I was so mixed-up...

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.867
...I didn't know where I was
or what I wanted.

01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:44.335
But now I know.
Now I'm sure of one thing at least.

01:26:44.504 --> 01:26:46.580
I want my daughter back.

01:26:46.756 --> 01:26:50.421
Personally, Veda's convinced me
that alligators have the right idea.

01:26:50.593 --> 01:26:52.052
They eat their young.

01:26:56.599 --> 01:26:58.592
I'm slightly drunk.

01:26:58.768 --> 01:27:00.428
<i>- Hello?
Is Mildred there?</i>

01:27:00.603 --> 01:27:02.430
<i>- Yes. Who is it?
- This is Bert.</i>

01:27:02.605 --> 01:27:08.975
Hold on. It's Bert. He's been calling
every day on the hour for a month.

01:27:09.487 --> 01:27:11.563
<i>- Hello, how are you?
- How are you? Just get in?</i>

01:27:11.739 --> 01:27:14.028
I'm fine. I got back this morning.

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.231
<i>- How about dinner?
- What?</i>

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:17.201
<i>- Dinner tomorrow?
- Tomorrow night?</i>

01:27:17.370 --> 01:27:18.401
<i>Don't you want to?</i>

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:21.746
Of course, but what
about Mrs. Biederhof?

01:27:21.916 --> 01:27:23.790
<i>- She's married.
- She is?</i>

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.288
<i>Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.</i>

01:27:25.461 --> 01:27:29.590
Oh. Okay, you pick me up
at the house at 7:30. Goodbye.

01:27:29.757 --> 01:27:31.916
Somebody married Mrs. Biederhof.

01:27:32.093 --> 01:27:36.091
Well, that's a novelty. Remind me
to bake a cake. How's Bert?

01:27:36.264 --> 01:27:39.633
- Huh? Oh, he's fine. He's working now.
- No kidding.

01:27:39.809 --> 01:27:44.804
- He has a job with Condor Aircraft.
- Manpower shortage must be pretty bad.

01:27:44.981 --> 01:27:48.065
To the men we have loved.

01:27:48.234 --> 01:27:50.061
The stinkers.

01:27:57.452 --> 01:27:59.610
I never did like this place.
Does Wally still own it?

01:27:59.787 --> 01:28:01.198
Yeah.

01:28:01.372 --> 01:28:03.910
- Two rum Collins, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:04.083 --> 01:28:06.325
I don't know why you insisted
on coming here.

01:28:06.502 --> 01:28:09.290
I thought it was a good idea.
Now I'm not sure.

01:28:43.998 --> 01:28:48.494
I am sorry I did it like this,
but I didn't know how to tell you.

01:29:09.649 --> 01:29:11.143
Mildred.

01:29:16.489 --> 01:29:18.529
- Hello, Wally.
- Hello, Mildred.

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:20.526
- Here to see me?
- I'm going to take Veda home.

01:29:20.702 --> 01:29:25.031
- Yeah? Veda know about that?
- No. I want you to help me, Wally.

01:29:25.206 --> 01:29:28.907
Oh, not me. She's your daughter.
I've never been a father.

01:29:29.085 --> 01:29:33.747
Veda's been here for about a month,
and I know the best way to handle her.

01:29:33.923 --> 01:29:38.419
If you want her to do anything for you,
just hit her on the head first.

01:29:41.431 --> 01:29:44.764
I'm telling you. What could he say?
He was floored.

01:29:44.934 --> 01:29:48.268
"Are you kidding?" he says.
"No," I says.

01:29:48.438 --> 01:29:53.100
- The powder room's down the hall.
- It's all right. She's my mother.

01:29:53.276 --> 01:29:57.605
- I didn't know you had a mother.
- Everybody has a mother.

01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:59.939
Yeah. I guess you're right.

01:30:00.116 --> 01:30:03.615
- This is Miriam. She sings.
- That's what they tell me anyhow.

01:30:03.786 --> 01:30:06.277
- I'm glad to know you.
- It's mutual, I'm sure.

01:30:06.456 --> 01:30:11.414
I guess this calls for a celebration.
Maybe I'd better send out for a beer.

01:30:11.586 --> 01:30:13.828
None for me.
- What can I do for you?

01:30:14.005 --> 01:30:16.294
- I want to talk to you.
- Go ahead.

01:30:16.466 --> 01:30:17.794
Well-

01:30:17.967 --> 01:30:21.668
- Why don't you go see if Wally wants you.
- Oh, he won't.

01:30:21.846 --> 01:30:25.298
Oh, pardon me, I'm sure.

01:30:25.475 --> 01:30:28.144
Won't you sit down, Mother?

01:30:30.104 --> 01:30:31.433
Well?

01:30:31.606 --> 01:30:34.939
I want you to come home, Veda.
This isn't your kind of life.

01:30:35.109 --> 01:30:39.403
- No? What is my kind of life, Mother?
- Well, I don't know.

01:30:39.572 --> 01:30:43.404
Whatever makes you happy, I guess.
That's all I've ever wanted for you.

01:30:43.576 --> 01:30:46.530
- Do you think I was happy in Glendale?
- Are you happy here?

01:30:47.288 --> 01:30:51.333
When I first came here, I used to cry
occasionally. I've gotten over that.

01:30:51.501 --> 01:30:54.502
- You're very fortunate.
- I know I've made you unhappy-

01:30:54.671 --> 01:30:58.371
It isn't easy for me to beg like this,
but won't you please come home?

01:30:58.550 --> 01:31:03.377
No. You must think I'm on a string.
"Go away, Veda. " "Come back, Veda. "

01:31:03.555 --> 01:31:06.509
It isn't that easy. I'm free now.

01:31:06.683 --> 01:31:11.843
No one tells me what to do. I do
what I think best, and I like it that way.

01:31:12.146 --> 01:31:17.686
I've had the house redecorated. All new
furniture. Even a new piano. You'd like it.

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:20.019
You still don't understand, do you?

01:31:20.196 --> 01:31:23.695
You think new curtains
are enough to make me happy.

01:31:23.866 --> 01:31:25.526
I want more than that.

01:31:25.702 --> 01:31:29.699
I want the kind of life Monte taught me,
and you won't give it to me.

01:31:29.873 --> 01:31:33.822
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused.
If I went home, it would start again.

01:31:34.002 --> 01:31:36.540
You know that. You know how I am.

01:31:37.297 --> 01:31:41.129
The way you want to live
isn't good enough for me.

01:31:41.301 --> 01:31:44.302
If I could give you the life
Monte taught you...

01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:46.712
...would you be willing
to come home then?

01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:49.926
But you couldn't, could you, Mother?

01:31:51.519 --> 01:31:55.766
You can powder your nose just so long.
Then people look at you funny.

01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:57.849
- Anyhow, your number's coming up.
- All right.

01:31:58.026 --> 01:32:00.943
Sorry, Mother. I'm on next.
I have to change.

01:32:03.656 --> 01:32:05.364
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

01:32:05.533 --> 01:32:11.406
- When will I see you again, Veda?
- Just drop around. I'll be here. Bye.

01:32:11.581 --> 01:32:13.241
Goodbye.

01:32:21.257 --> 01:32:24.294
So much for the upstairs.
It's a little gloomy, isn't it?

01:32:24.469 --> 01:32:28.549
Not quite so bad down here,
with the exception of the entrance hall.

01:32:28.723 --> 01:32:33.136
As you can see, the pride of the
Beragons isn't rolling in wealth.

01:32:33.311 --> 01:32:35.600
- You're not exhausted?
- Not at all.

01:32:35.772 --> 01:32:40.398
- You can't be serious about buying it.
- You're not a very good salesman.

01:32:40.568 --> 01:32:43.522
No, I suppose I'm not.
In here used to be a sitting room.

01:32:43.696 --> 01:32:47.112
Still is. I do all my sitting here.
Becoming quite an expert at it.

01:32:47.283 --> 01:32:50.320
- Do you live here alone?
- There are complete living quarters.

01:32:50.495 --> 01:32:53.282
Somebody has to be on the premises
to show the place.

01:32:53.456 --> 01:32:54.998
- Won't you sit down?
- Yes.

01:32:55.166 --> 01:32:57.871
- Can I fix you a drink?
- Please.

01:32:58.378 --> 01:33:01.295
I have the heel of a bottle,
no ice or seltzer.

01:33:01.464 --> 01:33:06.209
- Sorry I can't be more hospitable.
- That's all right. I prefer it straight.

01:33:06.386 --> 01:33:09.007
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, I prefer it straight.

01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:10.509
Oh.

01:33:10.682 --> 01:33:13.517
- Say when.
- When.

01:33:13.685 --> 01:33:17.350
- What happened to your orange grove?
- Sold for taxes like everything else.

01:33:17.522 --> 01:33:20.938
- The beach house too?
- No, not the beach house.

01:33:21.109 --> 01:33:24.478
An uncle with a little money
wouldn't let me sell it.

01:33:24.654 --> 01:33:26.860
He's hoping to foreclose on it instead.

01:33:27.031 --> 01:33:29.320
Sounds like a nice uncle.

01:33:31.077 --> 01:33:33.698
Now, Mildred, what do you want?

01:33:33.872 --> 01:33:36.113
- Well, I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

01:33:36.291 --> 01:33:39.292
You don't really want to buy
this antiquated tomb.

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:41.370
You'd be out of your mind.

01:33:41.546 --> 01:33:46.007
I don't know. It isn't such a bad
house. Remodeling would do wonders.

01:33:46.676 --> 01:33:50.508
Take off some of that gingerbread
and redecorate the inside and-

01:33:52.098 --> 01:33:54.671
My businesslike air
isn't fooling you much, is it?

01:33:55.184 --> 01:34:00.559
No, I remember too well. I remember
how it was with us once, and so do you.

01:34:00.732 --> 01:34:02.974
It isn't something either of us
can forget.

01:34:03.151 --> 01:34:05.772
- You haven't forgotten?
- Not for an hour.

01:34:05.945 --> 01:34:10.109
- Even this doesn't help.
- Then you can do me a great kindness.

01:34:10.283 --> 01:34:14.031
- lf I can.
- Ask me to marry you.

01:34:16.039 --> 01:34:17.830
Why?

01:34:18.333 --> 01:34:21.951
I must say, your attitude isn't
exactly enthusiastic.

01:34:22.128 --> 01:34:24.999
You went to considerable trouble
to get rid of me once so naturally...

01:34:25.173 --> 01:34:30.511
...I'm startled by your proposal
of marriage. This is a little sudden.

01:34:30.678 --> 01:34:33.465
I have my own reason
for wanting to marry you.

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.928
- A reason named Veda.
- Why should it be?

01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:40.050
Because your reason for doing anything
is usually Veda.

01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:44.607
Well, whether it is or isn't,
what's your answer?

01:34:44.776 --> 01:34:48.227
I can't afford you.
You have money, and I haven't.

01:34:48.404 --> 01:34:52.236
All I have is pride and a name,
and I can't sell either.

01:34:52.408 --> 01:34:54.864
- I see.
- I'm not enjoying this.

01:34:55.036 --> 01:34:58.322
Things are very different now
from the way they were.

01:34:58.498 --> 01:35:02.709
- I know. I haven't forgotten.
- Neither have I.

01:35:02.877 --> 01:35:05.415
I want you to love me again
the way you did then.

01:35:05.588 --> 01:35:07.747
I need that more than anything else.

01:35:07.924 --> 01:35:11.922
I told you then you were
the only woman in the world for me.

01:35:12.095 --> 01:35:14.882
- I loved you then, and I love you now.
- Then why-?

01:35:15.056 --> 01:35:19.469
I can't marry you. I won't go on
taking tips from you as I used to.

01:35:19.644 --> 01:35:22.764
Of course, if I owned a share
in your business-

01:35:23.815 --> 01:35:28.026
Oh, I see. I think I understand now.

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.609
How much of a share
would your pride require?

01:35:31.781 --> 01:35:34.616
Please don't put it that way.
It hurts me to do this.

01:35:34.784 --> 01:35:37.785
- I'm doing it-
- How much of a share?

01:35:37.954 --> 01:35:39.745
One-third.

01:35:42.208 --> 01:35:44.035
All right.

01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:46.119
Sold.

01:35:46.296 --> 01:35:48.537
One Beragon.

01:36:05.148 --> 01:36:07.306
- Hello, Lottie.
- Why, Mr. Pierce.

01:36:07.483 --> 01:36:10.021
Is Mrs. Pierce-?
Mrs. Beragon, is she in?

01:36:10.194 --> 01:36:14.323
She's in there.
I mean, this way, please.

01:36:14.490 --> 01:36:17.610
- Thank you.
- It's nice to see you again.

01:36:17.785 --> 01:36:22.578
- It's nice to see you, Lottie.
- It's been such a long time. Follow me.

01:36:22.749 --> 01:36:27.826
Oh, no, no, no. I'm supposed to announce
everybody. You stay there. Pardon, please.

01:36:28.004 --> 01:36:29.463
Please pardon.

01:36:33.009 --> 01:36:35.500
Mr. Albert Pierce!

01:36:38.848 --> 01:36:40.342
Lottie, not so loud.

01:36:40.516 --> 01:36:43.932
- No?
- Hello, Bert. It's nice to see you.

01:36:44.103 --> 01:36:47.603
Thanks. I thought I'd drop in.
I hope you don't mind.

01:36:47.774 --> 01:36:50.347
Of course not. Come in, sit down.

01:36:50.526 --> 01:36:51.937
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

01:36:52.111 --> 01:36:55.611
- My hours are too long these days.
- Let's sit over here.

01:36:55.782 --> 01:36:59.198
- This is quite a nifty place.
- We just finished redecorating.

01:36:59.369 --> 01:37:02.286
- You didn't come to the wedding.
- I read about it.

01:37:02.455 --> 01:37:05.824
It was informal.
Just Monte's family and friends.

01:37:06.125 --> 01:37:11.961
I probably have a lot of nerve to ask
this, but do you really love this guy?

01:37:12.131 --> 01:37:15.714
- I married him, didn't I?
- That doesn't answer my question.

01:37:15.885 --> 01:37:19.088
- Monte's okay.
- That still doesn't answer me.

01:37:19.264 --> 01:37:21.505
Are you in love with this guy?

01:37:23.351 --> 01:37:24.762
No, Bert.

01:37:25.937 --> 01:37:31.014
I'm not exactly in love with him.
But Monte and I understand each other.

01:37:31.192 --> 01:37:35.819
I thought if I moved from that
other house and fixed this place up...

01:37:35.989 --> 01:37:38.824
- ...I thought, maybe-
- Veda would come back.

01:37:38.992 --> 01:37:41.447
I thought that was why.

01:37:41.619 --> 01:37:45.403
I know you think I'm a fool, Bert.
But I can't help it.

01:37:45.582 --> 01:37:50.659
I'd do anything to get her back. I couldn't
leave her where she was, could I?

01:37:50.837 --> 01:37:52.876
No, I guess not.

01:37:53.047 --> 01:37:55.882
Anyhow, that's all I wanted to know.

01:37:56.050 --> 01:37:58.755
I guess we'll always fight about her.

01:38:00.013 --> 01:38:02.883
Mildred,
I brought you a wedding present.

01:38:03.057 --> 01:38:04.765
A wedding present?

01:38:04.934 --> 01:38:07.259
Take a look out that window.

01:38:23.369 --> 01:38:27.948
- Bert! Did you ask her to come?
- No. She called me up.

01:38:28.124 --> 01:38:31.873
She pretended it was something
else. But I got the truth out of her.

01:38:32.045 --> 01:38:34.749
She wanted to come home, Mildred.

01:38:34.923 --> 01:38:37.129
Tell her to come in.

01:39:03.159 --> 01:39:04.238
Veda.

01:39:17.215 --> 01:39:20.002
I wanted to come home weeks ago.

01:39:20.176 --> 01:39:23.011
When it was Christmas,
I couldn't stay away.

01:39:23.179 --> 01:39:27.675
- I'm so glad, darling.
- I'll change, Mother. I promise.

01:39:27.850 --> 01:39:33.521
- I'll never say mean things to you again.
- I said mean things too.

01:39:35.858 --> 01:39:38.859
- Mother, this is a beautiful place.
- Oh, Bert.

01:39:39.028 --> 01:39:41.519
I forgot to thank your father.

01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:47.318
- Bert, I'm very grateful.
- That's all right, Mildred.

01:39:47.495 --> 01:39:51.196
I don't believe it.
I simply don't believe it.

01:39:51.374 --> 01:39:55.538
Well, well, the prodigal returneth.
We'll have the fatted calf for dinner.

01:39:55.712 --> 01:39:59.875
- Hello, Monte!
- Hey. Tears of joy at seeing me again?

01:40:00.049 --> 01:40:02.587
- Of course.
- You look lovely, prodigal.

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:05.596
It's about time you came to see us.

01:40:05.763 --> 01:40:09.215
Veda's come home.
She's going to stay with us.

01:40:09.392 --> 01:40:12.061
- lf Monte doesn't mind.
- I think it's wonderful.

01:40:12.228 --> 01:40:14.221
Just don't call me "Father. "

01:40:15.648 --> 01:40:18.104
Blow, darling, come on.
Make a wish.

01:40:18.276 --> 01:40:21.443
Make a wish first.
You can do better than that.

01:40:21.613 --> 01:40:24.483
Three is all you get.
Three is all you get.

01:40:26.242 --> 01:40:28.069
Happy birthday, Veda.

01:40:32.707 --> 01:40:37.369
Be careful how you pour
that champagne. That's from 1927.

01:40:37.545 --> 01:40:41.329
- Is that better than '28?
- It's the newest we could get.

01:40:41.507 --> 01:40:45.671
Isn't this a beautiful night?
I just love parties, don't you?

01:40:45.845 --> 01:40:48.217
- I beg your pardon?
- Thank you kindly.

01:40:52.769 --> 01:40:58.854
Yes? Hello. This is the Beragon
residence. Who shall I say is calling?

01:40:59.025 --> 01:41:02.726
Yes, yes, Miss Mildred. I'll call her.

01:41:03.905 --> 01:41:06.478
Business is business, Mr. Jones.

01:41:06.658 --> 01:41:10.109
- Just take a look at this receipt.
- Hello, Ida. This is Mildred.

01:41:10.286 --> 01:41:13.287
- How's the party?
- Fine. Veda just cut the cake.

01:41:13.456 --> 01:41:17.454
- Get your clients to agree to more time.
- Out of the question.

01:41:17.627 --> 01:41:19.620
I'll be delayed a little.

01:41:19.796 --> 01:41:23.414
What's going on? Are you in trouble?
You sound so funny.

01:41:23.591 --> 01:41:27.755
No, I'll tell you about it later.
Keep the party going, will you?

01:41:27.929 --> 01:41:30.764
Okay, Mildred.
Get here as soon as you can.

01:41:30.932 --> 01:41:33.802
- Was that Mother?
- Yes. She's at the office.

01:41:33.977 --> 01:41:37.559
I'm worried. I think
she's in some sort of business trouble.

01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:40.019
It happens in the best of families.

01:41:40.191 --> 01:41:43.026
Don't look now, but you've got
canary feathers all over your face.

01:41:43.194 --> 01:41:47.406
Business and money is all she
thinks about. How about that drink?

01:41:47.574 --> 01:41:50.361
- Beauty calls. Excuse us.
- It's a pleasure.

01:41:50.535 --> 01:41:52.824
My clients demand an accounting.

01:41:52.996 --> 01:41:57.159
You must satisfy your creditors
or show cause why Mildred's Inc...

01:41:57.333 --> 01:41:59.373
...should not be taken away from you.

01:41:59.544 --> 01:42:04.253
If you resist, your creditors force you
into bankruptcy. It's as simple as that.

01:42:04.424 --> 01:42:06.084
Can they do it?

01:42:06.259 --> 01:42:10.755
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Beragon.
- Yes, so am I.

01:42:10.930 --> 01:42:15.925
I haven't a cent of ready cash in any
of the restaurants. So that's that.

01:42:16.102 --> 01:42:19.803
I hoped you'd scrape up enough dough
to get yourself out of this.

01:42:19.981 --> 01:42:22.768
- You can still manage the business.
- Very nice of you, Wally.

01:42:22.942 --> 01:42:25.777
Stealing the business from me
and then letting me run it.

01:42:25.945 --> 01:42:28.567
I'm not enjoying this.
I haven't any choice.

01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:32.358
You've bled this business to live
the way you have since Veda came home.

01:42:32.535 --> 01:42:33.816
- I know.
- Okay.

01:42:33.995 --> 01:42:36.912
You let a few bills go by.
Pretty soon you're in trouble.

01:42:37.081 --> 01:42:39.917
The creditors want your hide.
I can't stop them.

01:42:40.084 --> 01:42:42.042
Another month like this,
and we're all out.

01:42:42.212 --> 01:42:44.169
As it is, only I am, right?

01:42:44.339 --> 01:42:48.039
It looks that way. You'd be all right
if Monte hadn't forced it.

01:42:48.218 --> 01:42:50.376
Monte? What's he got to do with this?

01:42:50.553 --> 01:42:53.223
I thought you knew. This was his idea.
He wants to sell his share.

01:42:53.389 --> 01:42:55.963
I gotta go along or I'm out.
Didn't you know?

01:42:57.227 --> 01:42:58.507
No.

01:42:59.812 --> 01:43:03.513
- You married him. I didn't.
- Good night, Mrs. Beragon.

01:43:06.945 --> 01:43:08.688
I'm sorry this happened.

01:43:08.863 --> 01:43:14.202
If I do say it, as perhaps I shouldn't,
I think Mr. Beragon acted badly.

01:43:14.369 --> 01:43:17.903
Very badly indeed.
Good night, Mrs. Beragon.

01:43:18.081 --> 01:43:19.872
Good night, Jones.

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:40.056
Hello, Ida.
I want to speak with Monte.

01:43:40.395 --> 01:43:45.021
He isn't here. He drove off 20 minutes
ago, just after the party broke up.

01:43:46.317 --> 01:43:47.776
I see.

01:43:49.279 --> 01:43:51.105
<i>Mildred! Mildred!</i>

01:44:16.973 --> 01:44:20.840
I went to the house.
Monte was alone. And I killed him.

01:44:21.019 --> 01:44:24.803
You're lying. We know you weren't
alone in the house with him.

01:44:24.981 --> 01:44:29.192
We have proof of that.
And various other things.

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.195
Okay, now. Yes.

01:44:32.363 --> 01:44:36.824
We've had a slant on you from
the beginning. You were the key.

01:44:36.993 --> 01:44:41.240
We had to put the pressure on you.
The key turned. The door opened.

01:44:41.414 --> 01:44:43.905
And there was the murderer.

01:44:45.793 --> 01:44:49.044
We picked her up at the airport,
off a plane for Arizona.

01:44:49.214 --> 01:44:51.171
She didn't like it much.

01:44:51.341 --> 01:44:54.045
- I don't understand.
- You will. We know all about it.

01:44:54.219 --> 01:44:57.338
Your mother told us everything.
Why did you kill him?

01:44:57.513 --> 01:45:00.183
You promised not to tell. You promised!
You said you'd help me.

01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:04.134
- Veda, don't say anything more!
- Too late. That's all we needed.

01:45:04.312 --> 01:45:09.603
You left at 11: 15 with Beragon.
Your mother left her office at 11:45.

01:45:09.776 --> 01:45:12.979
You were at the beach house
when she got there after midnight.

01:45:13.154 --> 01:45:15.396
Isn't that right, Mrs. Beragon?

01:45:20.203 --> 01:45:21.531
Yes.

01:45:22.914 --> 01:45:26.034
I didn't know Veda was there
when I came in.

01:45:27.210 --> 01:45:29.701
<i>I expected Monte to be alone.</i>

01:46:01.911 --> 01:46:05.991
We weren't expecting you, Mildred,
obviously.

01:46:06.165 --> 01:46:08.573
It's just as well you know.

01:46:09.627 --> 01:46:12.083
I'm glad you know.

01:46:12.255 --> 01:46:15.042
How long has this been going on?

01:46:15.216 --> 01:46:20.970
Since I came home and even before.
He never loved you. It's always been me.

01:46:21.139 --> 01:46:26.014
I've got what I wanted. Monte's going
to divorce you and marry me.

01:46:26.185 --> 01:46:28.308
No, Veda!

01:46:28.479 --> 01:46:31.350
There's nothing you can do about it.

01:46:38.573 --> 01:46:39.948
Mildred!

01:46:41.409 --> 01:46:44.659
Use your head.
This won't solve anything.

01:46:55.965 --> 01:46:59.215
Just where did you get the idea
I'm going to marry you?

01:46:59.385 --> 01:47:01.378
- Don't joke like that.
- I'm not joking.

01:47:01.554 --> 01:47:04.224
If you think I'm going to marry you,
you're mistaken.

01:47:06.643 --> 01:47:09.644
You told me over and over again
that you loved me.

01:47:09.812 --> 01:47:12.303
- Did I? Then I must have been drinking.
- Listen.

01:47:12.482 --> 01:47:15.602
You don't think I could love
a rotten tramp like you, do you?

01:47:41.511 --> 01:47:42.756
Mildred!

01:47:47.725 --> 01:47:49.718
Veda. What's happened?

01:47:49.894 --> 01:47:53.974
It's Monte. He's dead.

01:47:58.778 --> 01:48:02.692
He said horrible things.
He didn't want me around anymore.

01:48:02.865 --> 01:48:08.370
He told me to get out. Then he laughed
at me. He wouldn't stop laughing.

01:48:08.538 --> 01:48:13.164
I told him I'd kill him.
He said I didn't have guts enough.

01:48:13.334 --> 01:48:16.869
I didn't mean to do it.
I didn't mean to, I tell you.

01:48:17.046 --> 01:48:20.878
But the gun kept going off
over and over again.

01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:27.005
Then he was lying there.
Looking at me, just looking at me.

01:48:27.181 --> 01:48:31.262
You've got to help me.
Give me money to get away. And time.

01:48:31.436 --> 01:48:34.556
I've got to get away
before they find him.

01:48:35.607 --> 01:48:38.524
I can't get you out of this, Veda.

01:48:39.903 --> 01:48:43.437
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

01:48:45.742 --> 01:48:48.030
<i>Number, please.
- Give me the police.</i>

01:48:48.203 --> 01:48:52.580
No. No, Mother. Think what
will happen if they find me.

01:48:52.749 --> 01:48:55.915
- Think what will happen.
- I don't care anymore.

01:48:56.085 --> 01:48:59.704
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
Give me another chance.

01:48:59.881 --> 01:49:02.882
It's your fault as much as mine.

01:49:03.051 --> 01:49:04.878
<i>Santa Monica Police.
- You've got to help.</i>

01:49:05.053 --> 01:49:06.844
<i>- O 'Grady speaking.
- Help me, Mother.</i>

01:49:07.013 --> 01:49:08.507
<i>- Just this once!
- Hello?</i>

01:49:08.681 --> 01:49:11.635
<i>- I'll change. I promise I will.
- Hello?</i>

01:49:11.809 --> 01:49:15.593
Give me another chance.
It's your fault I'm the way I am!

01:49:15.772 --> 01:49:18.726
<i>- Santa Monica Police Department.
- Help me.</i>

01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:20.145
<i>Hello?</i>

01:49:29.202 --> 01:49:34.825
I thought maybe, in a way, it was
my fault. So I tried to help her.

01:49:34.999 --> 01:49:39.329
- I wanted to take the blame for it.
- Not this time, Mrs. Beragon.

01:49:39.504 --> 01:49:42.873
This time your daughter pays
for her own mistake.

01:49:43.049 --> 01:49:44.543
Okay, book her.

01:49:48.555 --> 01:49:52.884
Darling, I'm sorry.
I did the best I could.

01:49:53.059 --> 01:49:56.428
Don't worry about me, Mother.
I'll get by.

01:49:57.939 --> 01:50:00.477
See that those others are released.

01:50:03.945 --> 01:50:05.487
We need some fresh air in here.

01:50:08.992 --> 01:50:11.280
It looks like a nice morning.

01:50:11.452 --> 01:50:14.952
You can go now.
We'll call you when we want you.

01:50:15.123 --> 01:50:20.081
You know, Mrs. Beragon, there are
times when I regret being a policeman.

01:50:42.275 --> 01:50:44.351
