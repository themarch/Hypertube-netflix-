00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.132
Hello, and welcome to Sol's Diner.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.540
I'm Val. I'll be your waitress today.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.578
Have you had a chance
to look over the menu?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.012
Might I suggest the meatball sandwich?

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.380
It's the owner's personal favorite.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.884
Sounds good.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:22.952
- Sir?
- Hi.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.753
Two Junior Meals for the kids,
and I'll have the club sandwich.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.294
- Okay.
- Oh, can I get some extra pickles on that?

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.954
- No problem.
- Thank you.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.131
Waters all around?

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.256
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.355
Okay.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.197
Okay, once the food comes,
that's it for the games.

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:42.230
All right! Wallets and purses
on the table in front of you, now!

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:43.969
Valuables in here.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.468
Hey! You listening to me?

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:14.299
What did you do?

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.475
I don't know.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.318
Thank you.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:37.988
Your menu.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.752
And for you, sir.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.789
Fancy.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.624
Well, I know you don't
get off the base much,

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.566
except for official business,

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.396
so I thought I'd take you somewhere nice.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.563
Well, I don't mind telling you

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.141
I've been looking forward
to this little date all week.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.233
I wouldn't exactly call it a date. It's...

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.006
Oh, I've watched enough of your television
to know what a date is, Daniel.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:05.744
It's a romantic event typified
by dinner, movie, and/ or karaoke,

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:09.015
and usually culminating in a night of...

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.790
Okay, this is definitely not a date.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.951
It's two friends and co-workers
out for dinner.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.787
- Oh, well, I...
Hi.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:17.885
Hi.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.830
- Can I start you off with a drink?
- Absolutely.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.026
Well, tonight's feature martinis

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.933
are the chocolate, passion fruit,
and shochu plum.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.030
They all sound wonderful.
So one of each, then?

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.574
Yeah, I think
we're going to pace ourselves.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:32.474
She'll do the passion fruit.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.010
And I'm going to have the bottled water.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:37.207
Sure.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.581
Listen...

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:47.249
- Let me start.
- Okay.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:52.788
Look, I know it hasn't been easy for you,
adjusting to your new life here,

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.130
learning to trust other people,
and, most importantly,

00:03:56.236 --> 00:04:00.138
refusing the temptation
to fall back on your old ways.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.367
But you have worked hard

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:05.273
to make a place for yourself with us and...

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.472
And dinner tonight
is my way of saying thank you.

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:10.315
Thank you for proving me right

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:13.214
when I said we could
take a chance on you.

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.782
I don't know what to say.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.925
Just say what you were going to say
before I interrupted.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:23.527
Okay. I need to use the bathroom.

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.801
Yeah. It's...

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.563
Okay.

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.357
She needs some fresh air.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.539
Your friend has taken ill.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.349
What? Where is she?

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:22.521
She was escorted outside
by another gentleman.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.424
I apologize for that.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.999
The surgery was performed
in a moving car.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.968
They were more concerned about
removing the subcutaneous transmitter

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.163
than being gentle about it.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.310
Do I know you?

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:24.144
You did, a long time ago.

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:28.847
Qetesh, the Goa'uld
that once occupied your body,

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.354
was a rival of mine.

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:32.321
She was a very intelligent adversary,

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:35.826
which is why I eventually decided
to partner with her.

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:38.024
In retrospect,

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:41.726
it's also the reason I should have
been more careful about trusting her.

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:43.893
As the host to her Goa'uld,

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:47.700
I was an unwilling participant
in many of Qetesh's thoughtless actions.

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:51.402
So, if this is a revenge thing,

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:54.480
your anger is, well, misplaced.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.980
This isn't a revenge thing.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.418
Oh.

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.718
This is a search for answers.

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:10.457
My position in the Trust
has afforded me considerable resources.

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:15.033
Ever since I heard
that you joined Stargate Command,

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:18.797
I've been watching and waiting
for an opportunity,

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.971
which finally presented itself tonight.

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:24.171
What exactly do you want from me?

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:29.943
The code to an Ancient tablet
that I helped Qetesh locate long ago.

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.517
A treasure map of sorts.

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:37.612
She was supposed to share it with me,
but instead decided to keep it for herself.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:41.056
From what I understand,
she was never able to decipher it.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.219
I'd like that opportunity.

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:45.763
To be honest, it doesn't ring a bell, so...

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:50.302
That's because you've suppressed many of
the details from your time as Qetesh.

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.995
The full genetic memory of the Goa'uld

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:55.596
would drive
your inferior human mind insane.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.174
Luckily, we have this device
to help us find what we're looking for.

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:08.315
This'll take a while.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:11.382
I'll leave you to it then.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:18.223
We've got the local authorities
searching the area

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.629
and conducting interviews
with every possible witness.

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:22.564
So far, they've come up empty.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:25.102
General, there's no question
the Trust is behind her disappearance.

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:26.694
I mean, they're the only ones
with the resources

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.637
capable of pulling something like this off.

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:31.266
Agreed. I've already put a call
through to Agent Barrett.

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:33.242
He's got his people working on it.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.836
We'll find her.

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.746
We're starting to get images
from her suppressed memory.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.790
Dial it down.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:56.030
How are you feeling?

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:58.560
A little dizzy.

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:02.266
A little tired. And very, very angry.

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:04.875
Oh, that's because the flashbacks
you're experiencing

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:06.638
are dredging up
some long-buried emotions

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:08.714
that may be coloring your conscious mind.

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:11.874
I'm going to kill both of you
in the most painful way possible.

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:15.678
Things will go a lot faster if you just relax.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:19.522
Whenever you're ready.

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.090
Jackson, rise and shine.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.599
What is it? What's going on?

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:30.964
Barrett, he came through for us.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.368
He just sent over a list of
suspected Trust safe houses.

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.963
Hopefully our girl's in one of them.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.515
Team One, what's your status?

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.681
Team One is in position.

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.185
Team Two?

00:09:57.863 --> 00:09:59.660
Team Two in position.

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:02.762
- Team Three?
Team Three is in position.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.770
- Do you know what I think the problem is?
- That I can't strangle you?

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:13.538
You're fighting the process.

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:16.877
In the end, all you're really doing
is delaying the inevitable.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:19.747
Why don't we try and keep an open mind?

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.521
All five teams are in position.

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:30.184
You have a go.

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:34.999
Who was that?

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:37.096
Turn it down.

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:49.473
Damn.

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:52.243
Maybe they'll have better luck
at the other locations.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.067
- Cover the door.
- Right.

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:35.683
It's all right. We're here to help.

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:17.595
Four out of the five safe houses
we hit were empty.

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:21.264
Only one, it turned out,
was still in play, and that was SG-15's.

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:24.831
We lost them and three members
of the local team.

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:27.708
One Trust operative survived
the explosion with minor injuries.

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:31.374
He confirmed that the place was rigged
to blow in the event it was stormed.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:34.976
He also confirmed
that Vala was being held at that location.

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:37.715
So, it's possible they moved her
before the place was raided?

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.814
Unlikely. They wouldn't have had the time.

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:42.985
Besides, the guy we caught claims
he saw Vala making a run for it.

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:44.926
Then she could've gotten out on her own.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.160
If that were the case, why has
she not yet attempted to contact us?

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:15.520
So, what did you want with her?

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.789
I mean, what exactly was going on
in that warehouse?

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:20.695
Look, I already told you. I can't say.

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.629
It's not that I don't want to help you,

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.703
but right now,
I'm more concerned for my well-being.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.066
We can protect you.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:27.662
No, you can't.

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:30.868
Okay.

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:37.038
He's all yours.

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:41.342
Where are you going?

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:44.889
I'll be out in the hall.
Just yell loudly if you need me.

00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:50.127
Don't bother.

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:53.164
Your Jaffa interrogation tactics
won't work.

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:58.901
Believe me, I've seen
some pretty horrible things in my life.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.734
You can't break me.

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:22.024
A member of this facility
gets kidnapped unchallenged.

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:23.890
It's no wonder
he doesn't think we can protect him.

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:25.361
But we can protect him.

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:27.830
Yeah, by locking him away
for the rest of his life.

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:31.198
What can you say? There's a downside
to working for super villains.

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:33.935
Well, this is probably going to
take a while.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:36.303
What do you say we grab a bite to eat?

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:40.070
You're done?

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:42.477
He was surprisingly forthcoming.

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:55.820
Whenever you're ready, honey.

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:17.576
How you doing?

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:19.514
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:20.880
I'm Sal, the owner.

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:23.853
Sal, the owner of Sol's Diner?

00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:27.254
Yeah, Sol was the original owner.
I bought the place from him.

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:28.393
Oh.

00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:30.825
- So, how was lunch?
- Delicious.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:34.791
Delicious enough to pay for it?

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.131
Yes. If I had the money, I would
certainly have paid for that meal

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:41.434
and given the lovely waitress
a sizeable gratuity.

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.004
The service was impeccable.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.874
Look, lady, everybody's got problems.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.949
I got rent on this place,
a mortgage, a wife, three kids,

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.951
and a Shih Tzu
with a recurring gastrointestinal condition

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:55.367
that requires a very specialized diet,
all right?

00:15:55.402 --> 00:15:56.682
That requires a very specialized diet,
all right?

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:57.881
Okay.

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:02.025
I'm sorry for trying to cheat you.

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:07.431
Okay. All right, look, if I let you leave,

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.398
can I trust you to come back
with the money you owe me?

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.490
No.

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:12.229
No? What do you mean, no?

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:14.670
What, you're telling me
you can't be trusted?

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:16.138
Truthfully?

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.469
I don't know.

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:24.081
I... I don't remember.

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:29.178
I have no idea who I am,
much less what I'm capable of.

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:33.054
All I know for certain is that about
an hour ago, I was lost, hungry,

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:36.889
and drawn to the delightful aroma
of the blue plate special.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.929
Is this a joke?

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:44.059
I have absolutely no memory of my life
prior to wandering in here.

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.405
If that's true,
we need to get you to a hospital.

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:52.666
No hospitals!

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:54.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:55.839
Hey.

00:16:56.915 --> 00:17:00.476
- Everything okay here, Sal?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.885
Don't worry about it.

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:10.655
- Let me go.
- Go where?

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:12.325
Please?

00:17:13.732 --> 00:17:17.532
- What, you got a home, you got a family?
- I don't know.

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:21.436
I would pay you back. I would.

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:26.310
Just right now,
I just don't have the means.

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:32.707
Maybe I can do something to help you.

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:40.658
Jackson, how's it going?

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:45.025
Well, from what we learned
from the Trust operative

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.657
and the information provided to us
from the Jaffa and the Tok'ra,

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:52.168
this is what I've been able
to piece together so far.

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:56.100
Athena, the Greek goddess of war,
a. k. a. Charlotte Mayfield,

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.403
a. k. a. The Goa'uld responsible
for kidnapping Vala.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.602
Now, according to what I've learned,

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:01.611
she was a minor player
who rose to mid-tier status

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:04.079
by pursuing alliances
with more powerful rivals:

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:06.811
Cronos, Camulus, Svarog, and even Anubis

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.784
when he was first on the outs
with the System Lords.

00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:11.287
So, her partnering up with Ba'al
is just her latest power play?

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.379
No, it's more than that.

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.823
You see, we know Athena was once allied

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:17.395
with Qetesh,
the Goa'uld that formerly inhabited Vala.

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:19.794
See, apparently,
Qetesh double-crossed her

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:24.062
when they partnered up to search
for the Clava Thessara Infinitas,

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:26.330
the key to infinite treasure.

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.770
Now, according to legend,
it will allow he who possesses it entry

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:32.742
to a vast storehouse of riches hidden away
by the Ancients prior to their ascension.

00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:33.812
Wow, that's big.

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:35.880
Yeah, and by all indications,
nothing but an elaborate hoax.

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:37.539
- So, they didn't find it?
- No, but for some reason,

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:39.913
Qetesh wanted Athena to think she had.

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:42.452
Athena believed her,
which is why she went after Vala.

00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:45.853
And she used Ba'al's resources
here on Earth to get her.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.621
Which reminds me, I'm supposed
to check in with Major Harper.

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:54.256
He's got people querying hospitals
in the area where Vala disappeared.

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:57.665
It's possible she may have been injured
and has been unable to contact us.

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:00.966
Hey, listen,
I spoke with the medical examiner's office.

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:05.407
They're doing DNA testing
on the remains recovered at the blast site,

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:09.641
but it's going to take a while.

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:18.147
You know, when Vala first disappeared
when the Ori gate was destroyed,

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:20.384
I refused to write her off.

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:21.550
Although the odds were against it,

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.289
I believed somehow
she'd found a way to survive,

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.927
and it turned out I was right.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.304
I want to be right again.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.766
Sure.

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:39.773
- I just figured you should know.
- Yeah. Thank you.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.015
Major Harper, please.

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:52.112
I don't care what the so-called experts
have to say.

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:53.623
I want you to free up the capital

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:57.491
and move it into a company
called Beringer Consolidated.

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:58.620
I have it on good authority

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.393
that they'll be announcing
a major breakthrough before week's end.

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:03.866
All right.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.832
The DNA results are in.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.966
They were able to ID 12 victims,
none of them our girl.

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:13.738
My guess is there wasn't enough
of her left to run tests on.

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:16.837
Or there wasn't anything left
because she didn't die in that explosion.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.474
If she got out, she would've gone
straight back to Stargate Command.

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:20.984
They wouldn't still be looking for her.

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:23.816
I don't know, maybe you're right.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.118
Maybe she is dead.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:30.594
But until we have confirmation,
I want you to keep looking for her, too.

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:51.240
Okay, dead cow on a turban,
hold the yellow, extra spud mush.

00:20:52.884 --> 00:20:56.047
Listen to you. You've been practicing.
Very nice.

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.451
Val, you okay?

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:05.454
Hey.

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:07.454
You all right?

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:10.532
Is it that visions thing again?

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.461
Look, I told you, you should
go get yourself checked out, honey.

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:14.630
No.

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:18.006
Sal, what am I doing,

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:20.839
working here, sleeping out the back,

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:24.313
watching reruns of The X-Files
in my spare time?

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:27.579
I appreciate everything
you've done for me,

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:31.281
but I've got to tell you,
I've been thinking about leaving.

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.447
So, where are you going to go?

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:38.621
I don't know, but this isn't my life.
It just doesn't feel right.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.694
Trust me, sweetheart,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.462
running away isn't
going to make things better for you.

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:46.730
Working tables here may not feel right,

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:48.806
but at least you've got a roof
over your head

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:51.740
and some friends who care about you.

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:56.113
It may not feel like your life right now.

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:58.444
Just give it some time, okay?

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:01.514
- Okay.
- Good.

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:05.347
Now, get back to work
before I fire your butt.

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:12.056
Hello, and welcome to Sol's Diner.

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:14.291
I'm Val. I'll be your waitress today.

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:16.335
Have you had a chance
to look over the menu?

00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:22.598
All right! Wallets and purses
on the table in front of you, now!

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:39.448
What did you do?

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:42.759
I don't know.

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:48.466
Okay. Name?

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:51.161
You know my name.
You're a regular at the deli.

00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:53.237
So, what, is "Val" short for "Valerie"?

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:54.464
Okay.

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.633
Yes. Valerie.

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:01.176
Last name?

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:07.678
Todad.

00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:14.548
Valerie Todad.

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.027
Look, Val, is there any reason

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:26.696
why you don't want me
to know your real last name?

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:27.863
No, of course not.

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:31.409
I'm just a very private person.

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:37.473
Would you mind
if I took a moment to freshen up?

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:43.511
Sure. I need a coffee anyway.

00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:48.288
Straight ahead, second door on your left.

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:03.739
Oh, sorry.

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.399
Oh. Hello.

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:30.728
I didn't know how long
we were going to be,

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:33.771
so I was just going out
to get us some lunch.

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:44.647
Run it through the channels,
see if anything comes up.

00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:46.611
I don't understand.

00:24:46.718 --> 00:24:49.448
I didn't do anything illegal.
I didn't hurt anyone.

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:51.852
Well, apart from those two fellows who,
from what I understand,

00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:53.652
I was totally within my rights to hurt.

00:24:53.758 --> 00:24:57.194
Witnesses say you took them both down
without even breaking a sweat.

00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:58.626
How did you manage that?

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.857
- Instinct.
- No. I think training.

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:04.925
Don't suppose you want to tell me
where you learned those moves?

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:08.633
That's what I thought.

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:17.106
- Sir.
- What is it, Chief?

00:25:17.382 --> 00:25:19.646
I thought you should see this.

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:26.457
Listen to me.
This is what you're going to do.

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:30.559
You're going to sell all of our
remaining stock in Beringer Consolidated.

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:32.823
I have it on good authority
that they're about to be rocked

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:35.593
by a major accounting scandal that will...

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:43.038
Nathan, I'm going to have to call you back.

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:51.844
- What is it?
- We got a call.

00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:54.448
Apparently, some people,
they're looking for you.

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.987
- Who?
- The United States Air Force.

00:25:58.023 --> 00:26:00.924
They're sending a Colonel Carter
to pick you up.

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:02.050
No.

00:26:02.427 --> 00:26:04.827
- What do you mean, no?
- I'd rather stay here.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.263
If you need me to commit a crime,
I'd be happy to oblige.

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.459
Look, Val, I don't pretend to know
what you're all about,

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:14.130
but when people start throwing
around words like "national security,"

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:16.503
there's not a lot I can do.

00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:19.099
All right, I'll be honest with you.

00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:22.638
The reason why I can't tell you who I am,

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:24.647
is because I don't know.

00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:25.773
I don't remember.

00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:29.547
I don't know where I'm from.
I'm not even sure if Val is my real name.

00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:33.351
My memory only goes as far back
as that day, two weeks ago,

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:36.894
when I wandered into the deli for a lunch
I couldn't pay for.

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:39.088
I don't remember any of
my life before that,

00:26:39.197 --> 00:26:41.165
although I do have flashbacks.

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:45.259
Occasionally, they're terrifying,
like something out of a horror movie,

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.394
but they don't make much sense.

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:49.132
I was hoping that, sooner or later,
my memories would just come back,

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.368
or that something would help remind me
of who I really am,

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:56.641
but after what happened today,
I'm not sure I want to know anymore.

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:05.688
You know, Val, it would be a lot easier
if you'd just be honest with me.

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:13.587
I'm Colonel Carter.
I'm here to take custody of the prisoner.

00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:14.665
Prisoner?

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.324
Would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:19.426
The government has been looking
for Miss Mal Doran for a while now.

00:27:19.904 --> 00:27:21.667
Why? What did she do?

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:23.866
I'm sorry, Detective.
That's classified.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.038
Don't let them take me away.

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:29.579
We appreciate your cooperation
in this matter, sir.

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.410
No. No, no, please.

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:33.984
Mr. Ryan...

00:27:56.274 --> 00:27:57.764
Detective Ryan?

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.878
Hi. Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter,
United States Air Force.

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:03.539
We're here for the Jane Doe
you've been holding.

00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:06.082
Another Colonel Carter just picked her up.

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:08.243
- When?
- About a minute ago.

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:10.981
Yeah, there were two of them. You must
have passed them on your way in here.

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:13.387
Black sedan, government plates.

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:16.459
They were headed for the freeway.

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:20.524
We need you to move that car!

00:28:25.503 --> 00:28:28.097
I'm commandeering your bike! Get off!

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:28.628
Why won't you tell me where we're going?

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:11.698
You all right?

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:15.679
Hey, everything's going to be okay.

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:23.749
Son of a... Mother...

00:30:31.729 --> 00:30:33.424
Is anybody hurt?

00:30:38.036 --> 00:30:39.663
Throw me the keys.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:41.800
Run away.

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:47.542
Vala, wait!

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:52.573
What did you just call me?

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:55.512
Vala.

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:57.885
Get up.

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:01.522
Get up!

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:09.091
- Where are we going?
- Just drive.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.862
- You know, I'm bleeding here.
- Shut up.

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:35.189
Oh, boy.

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.259
What are you doing?

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:46.035
Checking to see
if I still have both of my kidneys.

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:51.902
Vala, what the hell is going on here?

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:57.105
- You know me.
- Yeah, of course. Why?

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.210
You don't remember me?

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.480
I don't remember much of anything,

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:08.787
least of all who I am,
or why everyone is after me.

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:11.924
That's why I brought you here.

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:17.899
You're going to supply me
with some much-needed answers.

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:21.838
You know,
maybe we should call the rest of the team.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.431
They're generally better at answers.

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:27.170
Okay, here goes.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.607
Your name is Vala Mal Doran.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.919
You're a member of Stargate Command,

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:39.183
a top-secret facility located
beneath Cheyenne Mountain.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.555
It's the command center
for a military organization

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.359
responsible for off-world exploration
and reconnaissance

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:50.662
by means of a device known as a Stargate,

00:32:50.768 --> 00:32:57.640
a portal which allows near-instantaneous
transport between planets.

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:01.377
How am I doing so far?

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.172
Not good.

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:06.182
I know it sounds crazy, but it's the truth.

00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:10.882
Okay. So, we're space explorers?

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.184
Well, technically,
me and my team are the explorers.

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:16.624
You're just along for the ride because...

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:23.122
Well, you're not originally from this planet.
You're an alien.

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:26.931
And I mean that
in the nicest possible way.

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:28.665
You know, when you say "alien,"

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:31.264
people think green skin, four eyes,
tentacles, what have you,

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:35.278
but the reality is very, very different.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.069
I'm borrowing some more money.

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.240
Look, take you, for example.
You're human.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.478
Hell, you're more human than most of
my neighbors, especially that guy in 304.

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:44.179
I'll be back.

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:46.882
Look, since you're part of the team,
maybe you should think about...

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.015
Won't be long.

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.650
...trusting me?

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:56.565
Or un-cuffing me?
Or giving me my pants back?

00:33:57.235 --> 00:34:00.261
Okay, just wait right here.
I'll be right back.

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:05.203
Well, he's of no help.

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:08.142
All he remembers was the gun,
then he was off to the races.

00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:10.714
Presumably, you are searching
for the missing vehicle.

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:12.874
We've got all available units looking.

00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:15.680
In the meantime, it turns out the deceased
in that overturned sedan

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:17.948
were all carrying phony ID.

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:20.286
The license plate was also bogus.

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:22.382
As for the car itself,

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:26.987
it was a company vehicle registered
to a Forsythe Chemicals.

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.161
But that's a dead end because, apparently,

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.894
they reported the car
missing this morning.

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:32.697
Of course they did.

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:37.336
Carter.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.070
All right. Thank you.

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:43.614
We've got a lock on Cam's transmitter.
Thank you, Detective.

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:47.183
Yeah. Sure. Any time.

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:54.951
Okay, I think I've figured out
what happened to you,

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:56.253
why you don't remember anything.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.124
Oh, good.
Does it involve an alien abduction?

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:03.098
Well, in as much as that you're an alien
who was abducted, yes.

00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:05.364
You were undergoing a procedure

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.303
which was designed to dig up
some of your suppressed memories.

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:09.998
The scientist that we captured told us

00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:13.168
that during the procedure,
the device was destroyed,

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:15.108
which allowed you
the opportunity to escape.

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:16.840
From the aliens.

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.711
No, they weren't aliens.

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:22.047
They're working for an alien,
but that's not really important.

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:24.587
Vala isn't a particularly alien name.

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:28.216
So, I'm thinking that this device
was in the middle of digging up

00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:32.626
these suppressed memories
when it overloads and fries your brain.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:36.097
So, instead of helping you remember,
it actually made you forget.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.189
Everything.

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:39.929
Disodium guanylate.

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:43.473
That would make a great alien name,
don't you think?

00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:45.838
I can understand
why you might be having difficulty

00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:47.672
believing what I'm telling you,

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:49.541
but there is one thing you cannot deny.

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:52.912
There are some very, very bad people
after you.

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:56.009
And how do I know
you're not one of them?

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.917
Because I saved you from them!

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:59.956
What if they were trying
to save me from you?

00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:01.456
How am I supposed to know?

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:03.117
Let me take you back
to Stargate Command.

00:36:03.227 --> 00:36:04.455
We have a device that
can help you remember.

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:07.224
I thought you said
the device was destroyed.

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:09.390
It's a different device.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.230
It's one I brought back
from another planet last year.

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:15.766
Oh, good. Were they having a sale?

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:23.378
Understood.

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:27.550
We intercepted a communication
from Stargate Command.

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:30.018
They found him. Turn around.

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:49.001
This isn't what it looks like.

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:28.670
- What?
- Nothing.

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:31.373
I just think it's funny
how you're always losing your pants.

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:34.280
I'm not "always losing my pants. "

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:37.617
It's happened twice.

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:40.020
Twice is not always.

00:37:40.124 --> 00:37:41.216
Okay, thank you.

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:43.452
We've got something on Vala.

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:03.138
Vala?

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:10.486
Vala, it's me, Daniel.

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:16.659
We know you're in here.
There's nowhere else you could've gone.

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:21.923
Vala?

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:28.964
Vala?

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:33.809
I know you're scared,
but we're not here to hurt you.

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:37.080
We can help you remember.

00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:41.909
Colonel Carter!

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:28.994
Get out of my way.

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:33.595
Get out of my way or I will shoot you.

00:39:53.324 --> 00:39:56.293
You don't remember who you are, but I do.

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:58.219
You won't shoot.

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:23.476
If I let you go, I know
you're going to make yourself disappear.

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:27.414
You've been running so long,
it's almost second nature to you.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:34.120
You don't remember it,
but you made a decision to stop running.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.097
It's over.

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:40.829
Now it's time to come home.

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.218
Daniel.

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:31.654
You know, I don't mind getting shot,

00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:35.122
but I pulled a hammy
when I took out that last Trust operative.

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:37.694
At least you didn't lose your pants.

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:40.723
You wanted to see me?

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:44.597
- Hey, what did Dr. Lam say?
- I've been cleared for active duty.

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.329
Glad to hear it.

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:47.768
What's this?

00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:50.739
Let's just call it a welcome-back present.

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.938
- These are...
- Team badges.

00:41:58.048 --> 00:42:01.074
You're now officially a member of SG-1.

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:03.483
Congratulations. You earned it.

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:16.599
Perhaps a celebration is in order.

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:18.592
That's a great idea.

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:22.832
We can check out that new rib joint
near my place.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.100
Excellent.

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:28.872
Of course, that means we'll have to wait
until next week to complete our date.

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.773
It wasn't a date.

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:34.110
It was two friends
and co-workers out for dinner.

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:38.585
Seriously.

00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:45.953
It wasn't a date.
