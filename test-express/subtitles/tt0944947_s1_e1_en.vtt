One lot steals a goat

before you know it they're ripping
each other to pieces.

00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.439
I've never seen wildlings
do a thing like this.

00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:23.775
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

- ( Horse snorts )
- How close did you get?

00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:29.648
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the wall.

00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:33.819
Do the dead frighten you?

00:03:33.853 --> 00:03:36.288
Our orders were
to track the wildlings.

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:39.157
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:41.860

It's a good thing
we're not children.

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:01.880
You want to run away south,
run away.

00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:04.817
Of course they will
behead you as a deserter,

catch you first.

Don't think
too much, Bran.

A guardsman just
rode in from the hills.

They've captured a deserter
from The Night's Watch.

00:11:22.624 --> 00:11:24.993
Get the lads to saddle
their horses.

00:11:25.027 --> 00:11:27.061
Do you have to?

00:11:27.095 --> 00:11:29.429
He swore an oath, Cat.

00:11:29.464 --> 00:11:31.431
The law is law,
my lady.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.434
Tell Bran he's coming too.

00:11:36.236 --> 00:11:37.903
Ned.

00:11:37.938 --> 00:11:40.272
10 is too young
to see such things.

00:11:40.306 --> 00:11:42.073
He won't be a boy forever.

00:11:43.976 --> 00:11:46.310
And winter is coming.

00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:08.301
Lad, go run back

White Walkers.

00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:17.510

White Walkers.

00:12:19.513 --> 00:12:22.581

I know I broke my oath.

00:12:34.528 --> 00:12:36.362
And I know
I'm a deserter.

00:12:36.396 --> 00:12:40.099
I should have gone back to the wall
and warned them, but--

00:12:40.133 --> 00:12:42.301
I saw what I saw.

00:12:42.336 --> 00:12:44.336
I saw the White Walkers.

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:48.074
<i>People need to know.</i>

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.078

<i>Tell them I'm no coward.</i>

00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:56.683

Forgive me, Lord.

00:13:19.172 --> 00:13:21.974
In the name of Robert

00:13:22.008 --> 00:13:23.909

- Don't look away.

<i>...King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the first men...</i>

00:13:25.684 --> 00:13:26.822

<i>...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms</i>
<i>and protector of the realm,</i>

Lord of Winterfell
and warden of the north,

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.625
sentence you to die.

00:13:53.074 --> 00:13:55.541
You did well.

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:24.670
You understand
why I did it?

00:14:24.704 --> 00:14:26.672
Jon said
he was a deserter.

00:14:26.706 --> 00:14:29.374
But do you understand
why <i>i</i> had to kill him?

00:14:29.409 --> 00:14:31.176
"Our way is the old way"?

00:14:32.778 --> 00:14:34.746
The man who passes
the sentence

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.514
should swing the sword.

00:14:37.583 --> 00:14:39.918
Is it true he saw
the White Walkers?

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.790
The White Walkers have been
gone for thousands of years.

00:14:44.824 --> 00:14:47.627
So he was lying?

00:14:51.566 --> 00:14:54.368
A madman sees what he sees.

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:22.296
What is it?

00:15:24.065 --> 00:15:26.734
Mountain lion?

00:15:28.036 --> 00:15:30.038
There are no Mountain lions
in these woods.

00:15:57.235 --> 00:15:59.569
( Pup whines )

00:16:00.772 --> 00:16:03.406
( Yips )

00:16:16.022 --> 00:16:18.023
It's a freak!

00:16:18.925 --> 00:16:21.660
It's a direwolf.

00:16:29.503 --> 00:16:32.237
Tough old beast.

00:16:33.673 --> 00:16:36.441
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:38.609
Now there are five.

00:16:38.644 --> 00:16:41.312
You want to hold it?

00:16:43.314 --> 00:16:45.482
( Pup whimpers )

00:16:45.517 --> 00:16:48.018
Bran:
Where will they go?

00:16:48.053 --> 00:16:49.854
Their mother's dead.

00:16:49.888 --> 00:16:51.523
They don't belong
down here.

00:16:51.557 --> 00:16:53.491
Better
a quick death.

00:16:53.525 --> 00:16:55.393
They won't last
without their mother.

00:16:55.427 --> 00:16:57.595
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.363
- ( Whimpers )
- Put away your blade.

00:16:59.397 --> 00:17:01.532
I take orders
from your father, not you.

00:17:01.567 --> 00:17:04.368
- Please, father!
- I'm sorry, Bran.

00:17:04.403 --> 00:17:06.271
Lord Stark?

00:17:06.305 --> 00:17:08.773
There are
five pups...

00:17:10.242 --> 00:17:12.109
one for each
of the Stark children.

00:17:12.144 --> 00:17:14.946
- <i>( Pup cries )</i>
- The direwolf is the sigil of your House.

00:17:16.314 --> 00:17:18.516
They were meant
to have them.

00:17:23.455 --> 00:17:25.890
You will train them
yourselves.

00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:27.892
You will
feed them yourselves.

00:17:27.926 --> 00:17:30.962
And if they die,
you will bury them yourselves.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.305
What about you?

00:17:42.207 --> 00:17:43.808
I'm not a Stark.

00:17:43.842 --> 00:17:46.043
Get on.

00:17:52.952 --> 00:17:55.086
<i>( Whimpers )</i>

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.522
What is it?

00:18:01.326 --> 00:18:05.296
The runt of the litter--
that one's yours, snow.

00:18:14.106 --> 00:18:16.975
<i>( Bells tolling )</i>

00:19:05.154 --> 00:19:08.590
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you:

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:11.893
You worry too much.

00:19:11.928 --> 00:19:15.263
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

00:19:16.966 --> 00:19:20.536
<i>When we were seven</i>
<i>and you jumped off</i>
<i>the cliffs at Casterly Rock,</i>

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.905
100-foot drop into the water,

00:19:22.939 --> 00:19:25.007
and you were never afraid.

00:19:25.042 --> 00:19:27.743
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told father.

00:19:27.777 --> 00:19:29.644
( Whispers, mimicking )
"We're lannisters.

00:19:29.678 --> 00:19:32.146
Lannisters
don't act like fools."

00:19:33.816 --> 00:19:36.083
<i>What if Jon Arryn</i>
<i>told someone?</i>

00:19:36.118 --> 00:19:38.418
But who would he tell?

00:19:38.453 --> 00:19:41.588
- My husband.
- If he told the King, both our heads

00:19:41.623 --> 00:19:43.823
would be skewered
on the city gates by now.

00:19:45.359 --> 00:19:48.362
Whatever Jon Arryn
knew or didn't know, it died with him.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:52.199
And Robert will choose a new
Hand of the King-- someone to do his job

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:55.135
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores--

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.138
or is it
the other way around?

00:19:58.173 --> 00:20:00.574
And life will go on.

00:20:00.608 --> 00:20:03.177
You should be
The Hand of the King.

00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:06.046
That's an honor
I can do without.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:08.215
Their days are too long,

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.517
their lives are too short.

00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:16.889
<i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>

00:20:22.095 --> 00:20:23.428

<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

00:20:48.824 --> 00:20:50.491
All these years

00:20:50.526 --> 00:20:52.193
and I still feel
like an outsider

00:20:52.227 --> 00:20:54.462
when I come here.

00:20:54.497 --> 00:20:57.032
You have five
northern children.

00:20:57.066 --> 00:21:00.301
You're not an outsider.

00:21:00.336 --> 00:21:03.271
I wonder
if the old gods agree.

00:21:04.373 --> 00:21:07.275
It's your gods
with all the rules.

00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:15.351
I am so sorry, my love.

00:21:16.754 --> 00:21:20.290
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.861
Jon Arryn is dead.

00:21:23.895 --> 00:21:26.564
<i>A fever took him.</i>

00:21:29.335 --> 00:21:31.636
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a father to you.</i>

00:21:34.439 --> 00:21:37.708
- <i>Your sister, the boy?</i>
- They both have their health,

00:21:37.742 --> 00:21:39.910
<i>gods be good.</i>

00:21:49.654 --> 00:21:52.556
The raven
brought more news...

00:21:53.792 --> 00:21:55.893
The King rides
for Winterfell...

00:21:55.928 --> 00:21:57.628
with the Queen

00:21:57.663 --> 00:21:59.797
<i>and all the rest</i>
<i>of them.</i>

00:21:59.832 --> 00:22:03.101
If he's coming
this far north...

00:22:04.471 --> 00:22:06.672
There's only
one thing he's after.

00:22:06.706 --> 00:22:09.742
You can always say no, Ned.

00:22:18.452 --> 00:22:22.189
Catelyn:
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

00:22:22.223 --> 00:22:24.157
I'm told he reads
all night.

00:22:24.192 --> 00:22:26.093
I'm told he drinks
all night.

00:22:26.127 --> 00:22:29.430
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

00:22:29.464 --> 00:22:31.231
Stature?

00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:33.935
We've brought up
eight barrels of ale from the cellar.

00:22:33.969 --> 00:22:36.504
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case,

00:22:36.538 --> 00:22:39.207
<i>candles.</i>

00:22:43.313 --> 00:22:46.382
Why is your mother so dead set
on us getting pretty for the King?

00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:49.251
It's for the Queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

00:22:49.286 --> 00:22:51.387
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

00:22:51.421 --> 00:22:53.455
Think of all those
southern girls he gets to stab

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.057
with his right
royal prick.

00:22:56.825 --> 00:22:58.960
Go on, Tommy,
shear him good.

00:22:58.994 --> 00:23:01.463
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

00:23:01.497 --> 00:23:03.598
<i>( Laughter )</i>

00:23:38.368 --> 00:23:41.236
- <i>( Pup barks )</i>
- Gods, but they grow fast.

00:23:43.606 --> 00:23:45.073
Brandon!

00:23:45.107 --> 00:23:48.443
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

00:23:48.477 --> 00:23:51.680
How many times
have I told you no climbing?

00:23:51.714 --> 00:23:54.582
But he's coming right now--
down our road.

00:24:01.423 --> 00:24:03.991
I want you
to promise me,

00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:05.793
no more climbing.

00:24:10.198 --> 00:24:11.799
I promise.

00:24:14.069 --> 00:24:17.039
- Do you know what?
- What?

00:24:17.073 --> 00:24:19.374
You always look
at your feet before you lie.

00:24:19.409 --> 00:24:22.010
( Chuckles )

00:24:22.045 --> 00:24:25.414
Run and find your father.
Tell him the King is close.

00:25:09.527 --> 00:25:13.230
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

00:25:23.342 --> 00:25:24.976
- Hey hey hey hey.
- Ohh.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.311
What are you doing
with that on?

00:25:30.114 --> 00:25:32.250
- Go on.
- ( Arya groans )

00:25:33.552 --> 00:25:35.353
Move!

00:25:52.904 --> 00:25:55.072
( Neighs )

00:26:57.367 --> 00:26:59.368
Your Grace.

00:27:03.374 --> 00:27:05.475
You've got fat.

00:27:12.016 --> 00:27:14.184
( Laughter )

00:27:17.554 --> 00:27:20.189
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

00:27:23.393 --> 00:27:26.461
Nine years-- why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

00:27:26.495 --> 00:27:28.396
Guarding the north
for you, your Grace.

00:27:28.431 --> 00:27:31.200
<i>Winterfell is yours.</i>

00:27:34.237 --> 00:27:36.673
- Where's the imp?
- Will you shut up?

00:27:36.707 --> 00:27:39.409
Robert:
Who have we here?

00:27:39.443 --> 00:27:41.211
You must be Robb.

00:27:43.882 --> 00:27:47.518
My, you're
a pretty one.

00:27:47.553 --> 00:27:49.520
Your name is?

00:27:49.554 --> 00:27:52.122
Arya.

00:27:52.157 --> 00:27:55.193
Oh, show us
your muscles.

00:27:56.962 --> 00:27:58.463
You'll be a soldier.

00:28:01.067 --> 00:28:03.869
Arya:
<i>That's Jaime Lannister,</i>
<i>the Queen's twin brother.</i>

00:28:03.903 --> 00:28:06.105
Sansa:
<i>Would you please shut up?</i>

00:28:15.548 --> 00:28:17.749
My Queen.

00:28:17.784 --> 00:28:19.418
My Queen.

00:28:19.453 --> 00:28:21.654
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

00:28:21.688 --> 00:28:23.923
We've been riding
for a month, my love.

00:28:23.957 --> 00:28:25.658
Surely the dead can wait.

00:28:25.693 --> 00:28:27.660
Ned.

00:28:36.836 --> 00:28:38.637
Where's the imp?

00:28:42.007 --> 00:28:44.041
Where is our brother?

00:28:44.075 --> 00:28:46.276
Go and find
the little beast.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.814
Tell me about
Jon Arryn.

00:28:50.848 --> 00:28:53.483
One minute
he was fine and then...

00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:57.454
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.

00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:00.591
I loved that man.

00:29:00.625 --> 00:29:01.959
We both did.

00:29:01.993 --> 00:29:05.229
Robert:
He never had to teach
you much, but me?

00:29:05.263 --> 00:29:06.497
You remember me at 16?

00:29:06.531 --> 00:29:08.466
- ( Chuckles )
- All I wanted to do

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.135
was crack skulls
and fuck girls.

00:29:11.169 --> 00:29:14.071
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

00:29:14.105 --> 00:29:17.441
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.714
I need you, Ned--

00:29:23.749 --> 00:29:27.652
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

00:29:29.188 --> 00:29:32.056
Lord Eddard Stark,

00:29:32.091 --> 00:29:34.692
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

00:29:39.131 --> 00:29:41.199
I'm not worthy
of the honor.

00:29:41.233 --> 00:29:44.970
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

00:29:45.004 --> 00:29:48.540
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.

00:29:48.574 --> 00:29:50.675
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

00:29:51.944 --> 00:29:54.113
You helped me win
the iron throne,

00:29:54.147 --> 00:29:56.248
now help me
keep the damn thing.

00:29:57.283 --> 00:29:59.284
We were meant
to rule together.

00:29:59.318 --> 00:30:03.387
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

00:30:03.422 --> 00:30:05.790
Well, it's not too late.

00:30:07.192 --> 00:30:09.127
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

00:30:10.863 --> 00:30:12.697
We'll join our Houses.

00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:19.405
<i>( Woman moaning )</i>

00:30:28.617 --> 00:30:31.685
( Moaning )

00:30:36.691 --> 00:30:40.661
- <i>( Cup falls )</i>
- It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

00:30:40.696 --> 00:30:43.231
( Giggles )

00:30:48.937 --> 00:30:51.138
Did you hear the King's
in Winterfell?

00:30:51.172 --> 00:30:53.107
I did hear
something about that.

00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:55.408
And the Queen
and her twin brother.

00:30:55.443 --> 00:30:58.578
They say that <i>he</i> is the most
handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

00:30:58.612 --> 00:31:00.746
And the other brother?

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.816
- The Queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.852
and there's
the clever one.

00:31:08.721 --> 00:31:11.757
Mmm, I hear they
call him the imp.

00:31:11.792 --> 00:31:13.859
I hear he hates
that nickname.

00:31:13.893 --> 00:31:17.129
Oh?
I hear he's
more than earned it.

00:31:17.164 --> 00:31:19.932
I hear he's a drunken
little lecher,

00:31:19.967 --> 00:31:22.402
prone to all manner
of perversions.

00:31:22.436 --> 00:31:24.337
Clever girl.

00:31:25.806 --> 00:31:27.974
We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.

00:31:29.276 --> 00:31:31.177
Have you?

00:31:31.211 --> 00:31:33.079
- Oh!
- Already?

00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:37.951
The gods gave me
one blessing.

00:31:37.985 --> 00:31:39.886
( Door opens )

00:31:42.756 --> 00:31:45.358
- Don't get up.
- My Lord.

00:31:45.392 --> 00:31:47.727
Should I explain to you
the meaning of a closed door

00:31:47.761 --> 00:31:51.498
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt,

00:31:51.532 --> 00:31:55.168
but our sister craves
your attention.

00:31:55.202 --> 00:31:57.304
She has odd cravings,
our sister.

00:31:57.338 --> 00:31:59.472
A family trait.

00:31:59.507 --> 00:32:02.375
Now the Starks are
feasting us at sundown.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.611
Don't leave me alone
with these people.

00:32:04.646 --> 00:32:07.014
<i>I'm sorry, I've begun</i>
<i>the feast a bit early.</i>

00:32:07.048 --> 00:32:10.417
And this is the first
of many courses.

00:32:10.451 --> 00:32:12.653
I thought
you might say that.

00:32:12.687 --> 00:32:15.088
But since
we're short on time...

00:32:15.122 --> 00:32:17.023
Come on, girls.

00:32:17.058 --> 00:32:19.725
( Giggling )

00:32:22.095 --> 00:32:24.397
See you at sundown.

00:32:24.431 --> 00:32:26.999
Tyrion:
<i>Close the door!</i>

00:32:39.147 --> 00:32:42.149
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

00:32:43.886 --> 00:32:46.187
<i>She should be</i>
<i>on a hill somewhere</i>

00:32:46.222 --> 00:32:48.824
with the sun
and the clouds above her.

00:32:48.858 --> 00:32:50.826
<i>She was my sister.</i>

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.628
This is where
she belongs.

00:32:53.663 --> 00:32:56.198
She belonged with me.

00:33:01.571 --> 00:33:04.840
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:08.843
It's done, your Grace.

00:33:08.878 --> 00:33:11.513
The Targaryens are gone.

00:33:13.516 --> 00:33:15.817
Not all of them.

00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:19.254
<i>( Gull cawing )</i>

00:33:26.595 --> 00:33:28.696
Man:
<i>Daenerys!</i>

00:33:31.767 --> 00:33:33.634
Daenerys.

00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:35.703
There's our bride-to-be.

00:33:36.605 --> 00:33:39.740
Look, a gift
from Illyrio.

00:33:40.809 --> 00:33:42.576
Touch it.

00:33:42.611 --> 00:33:44.812
Go on,
feel the fabric.

00:33:49.451 --> 00:33:51.618
Mmm.

00:33:52.786 --> 00:33:55.589
Isn't he a gracious host?

00:33:57.759 --> 00:33:59.794
We've been his guests
for over a year

00:33:59.828 --> 00:34:01.796
and he's never
asked us for anything.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.565
Illyrio's no fool.

00:34:03.599 --> 00:34:05.934
He knows I won't
forget my friends

00:34:05.968 --> 00:34:08.003
when I come
into my throne.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.808
You still slouch.

00:34:18.446 --> 00:34:20.847
Let them see.

00:34:23.484 --> 00:34:26.385
You have
a woman's body now.

00:34:29.222 --> 00:34:31.023
( Sighs )

00:34:43.936 --> 00:34:46.905
I need you to be
perfect today.

00:34:48.307 --> 00:34:50.208
Can you do that for me?

00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:56.315
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

00:34:57.752 --> 00:34:59.352
No.

00:35:06.294 --> 00:35:09.363
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

00:35:09.397 --> 00:35:11.631
they will say
it began today.

00:35:34.554 --> 00:35:37.023
It's too hot, my lady.

00:35:47.502 --> 00:35:49.936
<i>( Gulls cawing )</i>

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.012
Where is he?

00:36:00.046 --> 00:36:02.680
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

00:36:15.895 --> 00:36:20.066
( Illyrio speaking Dothraki )
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.035
May I present
my honored guests?

00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:25.773
<i>Viserys</i>
<i>of House Targaryen,</i>

00:36:25.807 --> 00:36:27.508
<i>the third of his name,</i>

00:36:27.543 --> 00:36:30.878
<i>the rightful king of the Andals</i>
<i>and the first men,</i>

00:36:30.912 --> 00:36:32.646
<i>and his sister</i>

00:36:32.681 --> 00:36:35.316
<i>Daenerys</i>
<i>of House Targaryen.</i>

00:36:36.318 --> 00:36:38.186
( Speaking Dothraki )

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.688
Do you see
how long his hair is?

00:36:40.723 --> 00:36:43.424
<i>When Dothraki are</i>
<i>defeated in combat,</i>

00:36:43.458 --> 00:36:47.394
<i>they cut off their braids</i>
<i>so the whole world can</i>
<i>see their shame.</i>

00:36:47.428 --> 00:36:51.397
Khal Drogo has
never been defeated.

00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:54.400
He's a savage, of course,

00:36:54.434 --> 00:36:56.769
<i>but one of the finest</i>
<i>killers alive.</i>

00:36:58.038 --> 00:37:00.172
And you will be his Queen.

00:37:00.206 --> 00:37:02.841
Come forward, my dear.

00:37:42.915 --> 00:37:44.583
Where is he going?!

00:37:44.617 --> 00:37:47.152
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

00:37:47.187 --> 00:37:49.621
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, your Grace,

00:37:49.656 --> 00:37:52.157
if he didn't like her,
we'd know.

00:37:55.161 --> 00:37:57.429
It won't be
long now.

00:37:57.463 --> 00:37:59.364
Soon you will cross
the Narrow Sea

00:37:59.398 --> 00:38:01.833
and take back
your father's throne.

00:38:01.867 --> 00:38:04.768
The people
drink secret toasts

00:38:04.803 --> 00:38:06.503
to your health.

00:38:06.537 --> 00:38:08.872
They cry out
for their true king.

00:38:12.477 --> 00:38:14.345
When will they
be married?

00:38:14.379 --> 00:38:17.916
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:20.485
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.589
I wouldn't ask
Khal Drogo.

00:38:23.624 --> 00:38:25.491
Do you take me
for a fool?

00:38:25.525 --> 00:38:27.360
I take you
for a King.

00:38:27.394 --> 00:38:30.597
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

00:38:30.631 --> 00:38:32.999
My apologies if
I've given offense.

00:38:33.033 --> 00:38:35.402
I know how to play
a man like Drogo.

00:38:35.436 --> 00:38:38.338
I give him a Queen
and he gives me an army.

00:38:38.373 --> 00:38:41.242
I don't want
to be his Queen.

00:38:45.615 --> 00:38:47.717
I want to go home.

00:38:48.618 --> 00:38:50.085
So do I.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.255
I want us both
to go home,

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.590
but they took it from us.

00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.392
So tell me, sweet sister,

00:38:57.427 --> 00:38:59.628
how do we go home?

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:03.031
I don't know.

00:39:03.066 --> 00:39:06.068
We go home with an army.

00:39:07.704 --> 00:39:10.906
With Khal Drogo's army.

00:39:10.941 --> 00:39:13.943
I would let
his whole tribe fuck you--

00:39:13.977 --> 00:39:17.180
all 40,000 men
and their horses too

00:39:17.214 --> 00:39:19.082
if that's what it took.

00:39:25.556 --> 00:39:27.790
( Kisses )

00:39:36.198 --> 00:39:38.633
Do you think Joffrey
will like me?

00:39:38.667 --> 00:39:41.202
What if he thinks
I'm ugly?

00:39:41.237 --> 00:39:44.907
Then he is the stupidest prince
that ever lived.

00:39:47.243 --> 00:39:49.811
He's so handsome.

00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:52.547
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

00:39:52.582 --> 00:39:55.684
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

00:39:55.718 --> 00:39:57.552
Why would he say no?

00:39:57.587 --> 00:40:00.856
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:03.458
He'd have to leave home.

00:40:03.493 --> 00:40:06.428
He'd have to leave me.

00:40:06.462 --> 00:40:09.465
And so would you.

00:40:09.499 --> 00:40:12.100
You left your home
to come here.

00:40:12.135 --> 00:40:14.936
And I'd be Queen someday.

00:40:16.005 --> 00:40:17.573
Please make father
say yes!

00:40:17.607 --> 00:40:19.474
- Sansa--
- Please please!

00:40:19.508 --> 00:40:22.444
It's the only thing
I ever wanted.

00:40:26.282 --> 00:40:29.084
<i>( Music playing,</i>

00:40:32.722 --> 00:40:34.656

00:40:36.159 --> 00:40:38.427
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

00:40:38.461 --> 00:40:40.729
<i>Come on!</i>

00:40:59.215 --> 00:41:01.983

Uncle Benjen.

00:41:08.258 --> 00:41:10.025
( Laughs )

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.528
You got bigger.

00:41:12.563 --> 00:41:16.466
Rode all day.
Didn't want to leave you
alone with the Lannisters.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.435
Why aren't you
at the feast?

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.505
Lady Stark thought
it might insult the royal family

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.741
to seat a bastard
in their midst.

00:41:23.776 --> 00:41:26.478
Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.

00:41:26.512 --> 00:41:28.713
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

00:41:28.748 --> 00:41:30.448
So take me with you
when you go back.

00:41:30.483 --> 00:41:33.351
- Jon--
- Father will let me if you ask him.

00:41:33.385 --> 00:41:35.586
I know he will.

00:41:38.056 --> 00:41:40.290
The wall isn't
going anywhere.

00:41:40.325 --> 00:41:41.658
I'm ready

00:41:41.692 --> 00:41:43.026
to swear your oath.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.762
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

00:41:45.796 --> 00:41:48.264
We have no families.

00:41:48.298 --> 00:41:51.635
- None of us will ever father sons--
- I don't care about that!

00:41:52.837 --> 00:41:55.305
You might, if you knew
what it meant.

00:41:56.942 --> 00:41:58.576
<i>( Rattles )</i>

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.845
I'd better get inside,

00:42:00.879 --> 00:42:03.548
rescue your father
from his guests.

00:42:06.519 --> 00:42:08.587
We'll talk later.

00:42:16.428 --> 00:42:19.229
Tyrion:
<i>Your Uncle's in</i>
<i>The Night's Watch.</i>

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.534
What are you doing
back there?

00:42:24.569 --> 00:42:27.737
Preparing for a night
with your family.

00:42:32.209 --> 00:42:34.310
I've always wanted
to see the wall.

00:42:34.344 --> 00:42:36.079
You're Tyrion Lannister,

00:42:36.113 --> 00:42:37.714
the Queen's brother?

00:42:37.748 --> 00:42:39.949
My greatest
accomplishment.

00:42:39.984 --> 00:42:43.753
And you-- you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

00:42:47.157 --> 00:42:49.392
Did I offend you?
Sorry.

00:42:51.361 --> 00:42:53.963
You are
the bastard though.

00:42:55.198 --> 00:42:57.600
<i>Lord Eddard Stark</i>
<i>is my father.</i>

00:42:58.969 --> 00:43:01.470
And Lady Stark
is not your mother,

00:43:01.504 --> 00:43:03.772
making you the bastard.

00:43:05.975 --> 00:43:08.777
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

00:43:09.945 --> 00:43:11.746
Never forget
what you are.

00:43:11.781 --> 00:43:13.715
The rest of the world
will not.

00:43:13.749 --> 00:43:16.318
Wear it like armor

00:43:16.353 --> 00:43:18.888
and it can never
be used to hurt you.

00:43:20.524 --> 00:43:23.527
What the hell do you know about
being a bastard?

00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:28.232
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

00:43:43.716 --> 00:43:46.518
( Music playing,
chattering )

00:43:49.722 --> 00:43:54.092
You at a feast--
it's like a bear in a trap.

00:43:55.928 --> 00:43:58.262
The boy I beheaded--

00:43:58.297 --> 00:44:00.865
- did you know him?
- Of course I did.

00:44:00.899 --> 00:44:03.001
Just a lad.

00:44:03.035 --> 00:44:04.769
And he was tough, Ned,

00:44:04.803 --> 00:44:06.571
a true ranger.

00:44:06.605 --> 00:44:10.075
Pfft.
He was talking madness.

00:44:11.244 --> 00:44:13.479
Said the Walkers
slaughtered his friends.

00:44:13.513 --> 00:44:16.081
The two he was with
are still missing.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:20.919
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.

00:44:20.953 --> 00:44:22.587
Maybe.

00:44:22.621 --> 00:44:26.157
Direwolves
south of the wall,

00:44:26.192 --> 00:44:28.693
talk of The Walkers,

00:44:28.727 --> 00:44:31.329
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

00:44:31.363 --> 00:44:34.632
Winter <i>is</i> coming.

00:44:36.135 --> 00:44:38.035
Winter is coming.

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.537
( Chuckles )

00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:42.506
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.141
- How are you?
- I'm good.

00:44:44.175 --> 00:44:46.543
( Laughter )

00:44:47.846 --> 00:44:50.080
Is this your first time
in the north, your Grace?

00:44:50.115 --> 00:44:53.251
Yes.
Lovely country.

00:44:56.957 --> 00:45:00.359
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

00:45:01.629 --> 00:45:03.730
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

00:45:03.764 --> 00:45:05.999
up here
for the first time.

00:45:08.135 --> 00:45:09.869
Hello, little dove.

00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:13.239
But you are a beauty.

00:45:13.273 --> 00:45:15.374
- How old are you?
- 13, your Grace.

00:45:15.409 --> 00:45:18.143
You're tall.
Still growing?

00:45:18.178 --> 00:45:20.078
I think so, your Grace.

00:45:20.113 --> 00:45:22.347
And have you bled yet?

00:45:27.219 --> 00:45:28.919
No, your Grace.

00:45:30.289 --> 00:45:32.457
Your dress,
did you make it?

00:45:33.759 --> 00:45:37.095
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

00:45:38.865 --> 00:45:41.967
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

00:45:42.002 --> 00:45:44.237
I hear the same.

00:45:44.271 --> 00:45:46.339
Your daughter will
do well in the capital.

00:45:46.373 --> 00:45:50.077
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden
up here forever.

00:46:06.161 --> 00:46:09.464
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

00:46:09.498 --> 00:46:11.165
- I hope it's true.
- Yes,

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.067
the King has honored me
with his offer.

00:46:13.101 --> 00:46:14.602
I'm sure we'll have
a tournament

00:46:14.637 --> 00:46:16.604
to celebrate your new title--
if you accept.

00:46:16.639 --> 00:46:18.841
It would be good
to have you on the field.

00:46:18.875 --> 00:46:21.043
The competition
has become a bit stale.

00:46:21.077 --> 00:46:23.813
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

00:46:23.847 --> 00:46:25.348
Getting
a little old for it?

00:46:25.382 --> 00:46:29.019
( Chuckles )
I don't fight
in tournaments

00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:31.554
because when I fight
a man for real

00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:33.823
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:37.459
Well said.

00:46:38.494 --> 00:46:41.429
- ( Men laughing )
- Arya!

00:46:41.463 --> 00:46:44.065
It's not funny!

00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:46.834
<i>She always</i>
<i>does this.</i>

00:46:46.868 --> 00:46:48.736
<i>This was</i>
<i>my favorite dress.</i>

She always does it
and it's not funny!

I'm a Northman.

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:10.460
I belong here with you,
not down south

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:12.996
in that rats' nest
they call a capital.

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:16.765
I <i>won't</i> let him
take you.

00:47:18.234 --> 00:47:20.702
The king
takes what he wants.

00:47:20.736 --> 00:47:23.304
( Huffs )
That's why he's King.

00:47:24.773 --> 00:47:28.208
I'll say,
"listen, fat man."

my husband anywhere.

He belongs to me now."

00:47:38.253 --> 00:47:40.254
How did he get so fat?

00:47:40.288 --> 00:47:43.123
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.

Pardon, my Lord,
my Lady.

00:47:56.706 --> 00:47:59.541
A rider in the night...

00:47:59.575 --> 00:48:01.677
from your sister.

- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

00:48:12.055 --> 00:48:14.590
( Door closes )

00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:20.262
What's she doing
at the Eyrie?

00:48:20.296 --> 00:48:22.931
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:33.409
What news?

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:37.514
<i>She's fled</i>
<i>the capital.</i>

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.319
She says Jon Arryn
was murdered.

00:48:42.354 --> 00:48:44.322
By the Lannisters.

00:48:44.356 --> 00:48:47.125
She says the King
is in danger.

00:48:47.159 --> 00:48:49.428
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

00:48:49.462 --> 00:48:51.463
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

00:48:51.497 --> 00:48:53.999
Lysa's head would be

if the wrong people
had found that letter.

00:48:56.235 --> 00:48:58.937
Do you think she would
risk her life--

00:48:58.971 --> 00:49:00.605
her son's life--

00:49:00.639 --> 00:49:04.109
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

00:49:11.252 --> 00:49:13.152
If this news is true

00:49:13.186 --> 00:49:16.189
and the Lannisters
conspire against the throne,

00:49:16.223 --> 00:49:19.525
who but you can
protect the King?

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.761
They murdered
the last Hand.

00:49:21.795 --> 00:49:24.164
Now you want Ned
to take the job?

00:49:24.198 --> 00:49:26.032
The King rode
for a month

00:49:26.067 --> 00:49:28.101
to ask for
Lord Stark's help.

00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:30.770
He's the only one
he trusts.

00:49:32.239 --> 00:49:35.376
You swore the King
an oath, my Lord.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:38.511
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

00:49:38.546 --> 00:49:41.047
He owes him nothing.

00:49:42.883 --> 00:49:45.985
Your father and brother
rode south once

on a King's demand.

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:52.891

00:52:15.637 --> 00:52:19.173
without at least three deaths
is considered a dull affair.

00:52:20.442 --> 00:52:22.810
( Laughing )

00:52:31.719 --> 00:52:33.887
<i>Jadi,</i>
<i>zhey jorah andahli!</i>

00:52:33.922 --> 00:52:35.789
<i>Khal vezhven.</i>

00:52:41.529 --> 00:52:44.564
A small gift,
for the new Khaleesi--

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.102
songs and histories
from the Seven Kingdoms.

00:52:49.804 --> 00:52:51.204
Thank you, Ser.

00:52:52.807 --> 00:52:55.542
Are you from my country?

00:52:55.576 --> 00:52:57.744
Ser Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.

00:52:57.779 --> 00:53:00.513
I served your father
for many years.

00:53:00.547 --> 00:53:03.649
Gods be good, I hope to always
serve the rightful King.

00:53:26.775 --> 00:53:29.377
Illyrio:
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

00:53:29.412 --> 00:53:32.381
from the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai.

00:53:32.415 --> 00:53:35.450
The ages have
turned them to stone,

00:53:35.484 --> 00:53:37.586
but they will
always be beautiful.

00:53:39.723 --> 00:53:42.025
Thank you, Magister.

00:54:49.827 --> 00:54:52.295
She's beautiful.

00:54:56.367 --> 00:54:58.735
Ser Jorah,
I don't know how to say

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.604
thank you
in Dothraki.

00:55:00.639 --> 00:55:03.574
There is no word
for thank you in Dothraki.

00:55:24.662 --> 00:55:26.663
Make him happy.

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:41.411
( Waves crashing )

00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:28.126
- No.
- ( Sobs )

00:56:31.163 --> 00:56:33.331
Do you know
the common tongue?

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.804
- <i>( Pin clanks )</i>
- No.

00:56:43.676 --> 00:56:46.244
Is "no" the only word
that you know?

00:56:47.346 --> 00:56:49.080
<i>No.</i>

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.788
( Sobbing continues )

00:57:17.376 --> 00:57:19.610
Rough night, imp?

00:57:19.644 --> 00:57:21.712
If I get through this
without squirting

00:57:21.747 --> 00:57:24.148
from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.

00:57:24.182 --> 00:57:26.550
I didn't pick you
for a hunter.

00:57:26.584 --> 00:57:29.686
The greatest in the land--
my spear never misses.

00:57:30.888 --> 00:57:33.457
It's not hunting
if you pay for it.

00:57:41.599 --> 00:57:43.867
Are you as good
with a spear as you used to be?

00:57:43.901 --> 00:57:46.436
No, but I'm still
better than you.

00:57:46.471 --> 00:57:48.372
( Laughs )

00:57:49.507 --> 00:57:51.374
I know what I'm
putting you through.

00:57:51.409 --> 00:57:53.410
Thank you for saying yes.

00:57:54.845 --> 00:57:57.280
I only ask you
because I need you.

00:57:58.482 --> 00:58:00.383
You're a loyal friend.

00:58:00.418 --> 00:58:03.720
You hear me?
A <i>loyal friend.</i>

00:58:03.755 --> 00:58:05.555
The last one I've got.

00:58:07.191 --> 00:58:09.359
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

00:58:10.894 --> 00:58:13.830
And I'll make sure you
don't look so fucking grim all the time.

00:58:15.098 --> 00:58:17.534
<i>Come on, boys,</i>
<i>let's go kill some boar!</i>

00:58:27.478 --> 00:58:29.646
Come on, you.

00:58:44.196 --> 00:58:46.565
( Whines )

00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.107
( Grunts )

00:58:59.978 --> 00:59:01.912
( Soft barks )

00:59:08.219 --> 00:59:10.554
<i>( Woman gasping )</i>

00:59:14.192 --> 00:59:16.827
<i>( Moaning )</i>

00:59:25.973 --> 00:59:28.942
( Grunting, moaning )

00:59:43.957 --> 00:59:46.491
( Gasps )
Stop!

00:59:46.526 --> 00:59:48.393
- Stop.
- ( Gasps )

00:59:53.199 --> 00:59:55.468
Are you completely mad?

00:59:55.502 --> 00:59:58.404
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

00:59:58.438 --> 01:00:00.306
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.609
I heard you
the first time.

01:00:03.678 --> 01:00:05.379
( Whimpers )

01:00:06.581 --> 01:00:09.016
Quite the little climber,
aren't you?

01:00:10.152 --> 01:00:13.087
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.

01:00:13.121 --> 01:00:14.821
10.

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:26.032
The things
I do for love.

01:00:32.706 --> 01:00:35.374
