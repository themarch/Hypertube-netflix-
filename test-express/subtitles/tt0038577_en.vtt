00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.361
<i>To the assistant commissioner
of the police, Scotland Yard.</i>

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.728
<i>Sir, the amazing events
which I am reporting...</i>

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.767
<i>may be said to have begun...</i>

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:19.032
<i>on the evening
of August the 17th, 1944.</i>

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.335
<i>New paragraph.</i>

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:24.342
<i>A postman was cycling
up Heron's Hill...</i>

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.709
<i>on his way to deliver mail
at the hospital.</i>

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.647
<i>His name was Joseph Higgins.</i>

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:34.710
<i>I begin with him
because he was the first to die.</i>

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:45.027
<i>The hospital itself lay a mile away...</i>

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.794
<i>an Elizabethan manor
requisitioned and converted...</i>

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.960
<i>in the emergency of war.</i>

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.428
<i>Another new paragraph.</i>

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.868
<i>In the operating theatre that night...</i>

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.875
<i>there was a surgeon,
Mr. Eden...</i>

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.409
<i>Nurse Woods...</i>

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.313
<i>Nurse Sanson...</i>

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:16.919
<i>the, uh...
the theatre sister, Bates...</i>

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.898
<i>Nurse Linley...</i>

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:26.831
<i>and the anesthetist,
Dr. Barnes.</i>

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.868
<i>August the 17th, 1944.</i>

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:35.938
<i>By August the 22nd...</i>

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:39.610
<i>two of these people
would be dead...</i>

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.211
<i>and one of them a murderer.</i>

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.672
<i>What's up? Had a puncture?</i>

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.301
No, that second doodlebug this afternoon
dropped right behind the post office...

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:07.312
just as I was askin'
if these were sorted out.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.814
They were sorted out, all right.
So were we.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.818
That's the lot. Five.
And a bill for Dr. Barnes.

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:12.829
Might be a receipt.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.820
Might be.
I shall be late on duty. So long, Mac.

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:19.289
- Can't be in two places at once.
- Our old warden takes a different view.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.692
- All right for darts Saturday, Joe?
- You bet. Have a quiet night.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.196
<i>Some hopes.</i>

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.199
<i>What is good morale?</i>

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.169
<i>Discipline and confidence,
the one dependent on the other.</i>

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:34.468
<i>I repeat:
Discipline and confidence.</i>

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.067
And you cannot have confidence
without positive thinking...

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:43.741
be you students or nurses,
under bombardment or otherwise.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.750
A small instance...

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:48.753
You may smile when I tell you
that one of my first acts...

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.255
when I took over this hospital
a month ago...

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:55.124
was to order the word "waste"
to be painted out from the refuse bins...

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:58.721
and instead to substitute
the word "salvage".

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.232
"Salvage".

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:06.739
A humble example of the difference
between positive and negative thinking.

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.676
An essential fact
in the building and maintenance of...

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.740
Morale.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.916
Another of them coming.
Tried to race me on me bicycle.

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.917
- Bit late, aren't you, Joe?
- Yes.

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:54.976
<i>Doodlebug dropped right...</i>

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:58.581
<i>... is only V-1.
It remains to be seen what other numbers...</i>

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:01.786
<i>will be suffixed to the letter "V."</i>

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:11.235
<i>As the desperate Churchill...</i>

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.238
<i>lies frantically to save his face...</i>

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:18.676
<i>London and the home counties are reeling
under the incessant fire of our terrible V-1.</i>

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:23.011
This is Germany calling.
This is Germany calling.

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:28.079
There.
That's all, Sister.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.554
I thought it wasn't
a diverticulum.

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:33.387
- Is he all right?
- Hasn't turned a hair.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.893
- You all right, Nurse Linley?
- Yes, thank you, sir. Perfectly.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:38.897
It's always a bit of an ordeal
the first time.

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:41.991
- Wonder where that doodlebug dropped.
- Somewhere near the village?

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.832
I hope it missed my house.
What a life.

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:48.499
- Well, it can't last forever.
- Nurses stand up to it awfully well.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.599
So do the doctors, sir.

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:53.144
One can get used to anything in time.

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:56.204
Still, it must have been a bit of a change
for you too, sir, considering.

00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:57.874
- Considering what?
- Your past.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.611
- Mmm?
- Thank you.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:03.143
I mean Harley Street...
Rolls-Royce, lovely ladies.

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:06.191
All, all are gone,
the old familiar faces.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.489
They left their appendixes behind them.

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:12.895
- They were happy to be in the fashion.
- And even happier to be in your consulting room.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:17.163
It's those eyes, of course.
The wounded stag look that no woman can resist.

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:18.999
<i>- I...
- Woods.</i>

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.835
Why aren't you tidying up?
There's plenty to do.

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:23.535
Yes, Sister.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.879
Clear out the swabs
and get some fresh saline.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.279
- There may be more casualties in.
- Yes, Sister.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.953
- You look tired, Esther.
- Oh, I'm all right.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:43.307
I'll make you a cup of something
before you go to bed.

00:07:43.318 --> 00:07:44.463
Thank you.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.154
Sanson, will you take the patient
back to the ward?

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:48.466
Yes, Sister.

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:55.366
<i>- Yes, Sister.
- I can see that. But after all...</i>

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:58.740
I'm not being in the least unreasonable.
I naturally thought you'd go with me tomorrow.

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:01.974
Darling, it's just a tatty little hospital hop,
not a ball at the Dorchester.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:05.245
<i>- Does it matter who goes with whom?
- I suppose not, but...</i>

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:09.044
I was about to add,
Eden had a nerve to ask you.

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:11.681
Surgeons quite often ask nurses
on informal occasions.

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:14.191
- I know, but...
- I don't suppose he thought twice about it.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.194
- I wonder.
- Now you're being ridiculous.

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:18.253
- Am I?
- Not to say pompous.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.026
<i>- I'm being nothing of the kind.
- Must you shout?</i>

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:23.330
You know, it's really amazing how you
always contrive to put me in the wrong.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:26.337
Well, you seem to think you can even dictate
who I'm to go to a dance with.

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.340
I don't want to dictate to anybody.
I've none of the instincts of a dictator.

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:32.809
- Then why dictate?
- What is the matter with you these days, Freddi?

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:35.814
I simply took it for granted
you were going with me, that's all.

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:38.817
- I don't like being taken for granted.
- Well, we are supposed to be engaged.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.819
<i>You mean, we were.</i>

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:44.584
- Is that remark intended to have any point?
- Yes. We can't go on like this.

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:48.821
<i>Nurse Linley. As you have nothing to do here,
would you please move outside.</i>

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:53.765
Dr. Barnes, I do hope you won't be long.
We've still a great deal of clearing up to do.

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:57.064
Don't know what's happened
to hospital discipline this evening.

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.070
<i>Ready, Barney?</i>

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:02.073
Let's hope that's all
for this evening.

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:04.336
Sorry, Sister.
Time for a hundred up before dinner.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.344
- Coming?
- Yes. Right. I'll follow you down.

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:08.846
Get some rest, Nurse.
You're on night duty, aren't you?

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:10.906
- Yes, sir. I'm just going off for now.
- Good.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.747
- Oh, uh, good night, Sister.
- Good night, Mr. Eden.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:30.360
Casualties. Woods, you'll be needed
in casualty reception with Dr. Barnes.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.427
I'll finish here.

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:51.514
<i>And a little later
they brought in Joseph Higgins.</i>

00:09:57.997 --> 00:10:00.830
- Well, Nurse?
- Uh, fractured tib and fib.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.027
And he's had a quarter of morphia.

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:05.036
In shock too.
Got his name?

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:07.038
No. It's left blank.

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:10.041
- No identity disk?
- He couldn't have been wearing one.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:13.169
We'll have to make room for him in St. Cath's.
Someone's sure to come forward.

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:15.179
- Tell Mr. Eden.
- Yes, sir.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.545
Compound. Otherwise straightforward.
No internal injuries.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.555
- You haven't cleaned him up, Nurse?
- No, sir.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.057
He was still badly shocked
when they brought him in.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:29.561
Quite right. They fixed him up with a splint.
It's best to leave him as he is for a while.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.563
- X-ray first thing in the morning.
- Yes, sir.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.566
Then we'll take him out to the theatre
and operate at 10:00. All right?

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.568
- Very good, sir.
- Good.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.628
- Clean him up a bit now, but don't worry him.
- Yes, sir.

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.404
Had any more of those nightmares?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.413
- No.
- Meaning yes, I suppose.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.540
Why don't you take a leave?

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:53.176
I might later.
I'd sooner work now.

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:56.983
I suppose you were right
coming back here so soon after...

00:10:57.056 --> 00:11:01.618
My dear, it isn't the best of atmospheres
for you, you know... constant reminders.

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:04.629
There are lots of jobs outside
where you'd be helping just as much.

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:07.165
- I want to carry on here.
- My dear, you're young.

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:10.964
You don't want to poison your life blaming
yourself for something which you couldn't help.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:13.562
- I knew your mother, don't forget, and...
- Please.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.766
All right.

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.578
Me helmet.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.642
You never turned off the wireless.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.416
- You never turned off...
- You poor thing.

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:50.171
Am I late, Esther? Sorry.
I fell asleep, and...

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:52.506
- What's the matter?
- Oh, hello, Freddi.

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:55.672
- You look completely out on your feet, dear.
- Yes, I am a bit.

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:58.683
Plenty of sleep, that's what you need.
Hop off now. I'll see to everything.

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.185
- Anyone to fix?
- Yes. Three stat, one S.O.S.

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:04.188
- It's all in the prescription book.
- I'll give them. Off you go.

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:07.419
- Thank you, Freddi. Good night.
- Good night. See you in the morning.

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:28.236
Aren't you going
to kiss me good night, Nurse?

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.155
H
