WEBVTT

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.761
- I'm going to work in Woolworths.

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.521
- When I grow up I want
to be an astronaut.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.841
- When I get married I'd
like to have 2 children.

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:25.801
- My hearts desire is to see my Daddy.

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:29.241
- I don't want to answer that.

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.961
- This is no
ordinary outing at the zoo,

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:36.681
it's a very special occasion.

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:38.281
We've brought these
children together for the

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:41.401
very first time.

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.481
They're like any other children except

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:46.401
that they come from startlingly
different backgrounds.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.441
- Stop it at once.

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:50.681
- We've brought
these children together

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:55.681
because we wanted a glimpse
of England in the year 2000.

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.161
The shop steward and the executive

00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:00.961
of the year 2000 are now 7 years old.

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:07.081
- In 1964
WORLD IN ACTION made 7 Up.

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:10.521
We have been back to film
these children every 7 years.

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:12.161
They are now 35.

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:15.361
- Give me a child until he is 7

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:16.841
and I will give you the man.

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:24.961
- Is it important to fight, yes.

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:35.681
I want to be a jockey when I grow up,

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:37.241
yeah I want to be a jockey when I grow up.

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:42.241
- At 14 Tony
was already an apprentice

00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:44.641
at Tommy Gosling's
racing stables in Epsom.

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:46.641
He left school at 15.

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.761
- This is a photo finish
of when I rode at Newbury.

00:01:57.761 --> 00:01:59.201
I'm the one with the white cap.

00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:01.281
I was beaten a length and a half a third

00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.401
and had a photo finish.

00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:06.361
So I took it out of the box
and kept it as a souvenir.

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:11.361
My greatest fulfilment in
life, when I rode at Kempton

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.881
in the same race as Lester Piggott.

00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:16.521
I was a naive wet behind
the ears apprentice.

00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:20.761
All my years from 7, all
my ambitions fulfilled

00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:25.761
in one moment and I
eventually finished last.

00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:27.201
Tailed off obviously but it

00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:29.401
didn't make any difference to me.

00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:32.441
Just to be part of it,
be with the man himself.

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:37.401
Couldn't buy it, that was the
proudest day of my whole life.

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:48.921
- Tony's now 34.

00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:52.081
At weekends he takes
his girls to a stables

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.161
where the family keeps a couple of ponies.

00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:03.441
What's it mean to you when
you see the girls on a horse?

00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:05.881
- There are times you
look back and you look at them

00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:08.201
and you see yourself in them all the time.

00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.481
Wait come here.

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.601
- Got down first didn't I.

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:11.921
- Yeah.

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:12.721
When I was a kid right,

00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:15.401
no one ever ever showed
me how to ride a horse.

00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.641
I had to go out and do it myself.

00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:21.801
Just walk him, hold them
legs nice and properly.

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.441
When I see them riding I sort of like

00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:24.601
"Oh I taught them that"

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:27.841
and I see them doing this and
I show them in another way.

00:03:28.681 --> 00:03:29.801
Then once they learn it I sort of like pat

00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:31.121
them on their bum

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.161
sort of put them on
automatic pilot you know

00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:34.801
and they're on their own.

00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:35.961
But that's what life's all about isn't it?

00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:38.001
Giving your kids all the opportunities

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:40.361
that give them the benefits
that you never had.

00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:43.481
Don't be afraid, never
be afraid, they know.

00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:47.921
Horses were my whole life,
flesh, blood, in my veins,

00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:50.401
it was you know all the smell everything.

00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:53.481
Princess Anne to her
horses and Lester Piggott

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:56.001
to his that's how I felt.

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:57.441
- And you let it go?

00:03:57.441 --> 00:03:58.281
- I let it go.

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:02.641
- Sometimes on Saturday
morning I go to the pictures.

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:06.001
Sometimes with my friend
and sometimes with him.

00:04:06.921 --> 00:04:08.081
- You don't.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.561
- I do.

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:12.481
- She don't, I don't ever see you.

00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:18.001
You go to a different pictures.

00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:19.241
- Have you got a girlfriend?

00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.321
- No.

00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:22.881
- Would you
like to have a girlfriend?

00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:24.081
- No.

00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:26.961
You understand the Four F's, Find them,

00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:28.121
Feed them and Forget them.

00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:31.121
The other F I'll let you
use your own discrimination.

00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:35.801
I mean, this one, I
tried to do the Three Fs

00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:37.641
but I couldn't forget her.

00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:41.961
- I used to work in a pub
just on a Friday night.

00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:46.801
Barmaids, barmaiding
and from there one night

00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:48.641
I went to a discotheque.

00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:51.801
He was in the pub earlier on

00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:54.081
and that afterwards we
went to a discotheque

00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:56.801
and Tony was down there and I just,

00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:59.081
from there I just that was it.

00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:03.081
Couldn't get rid of him.

00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:09.201
- We have our ups and downs,
no more than anyone else.

00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:12.241
- I think you got to work at a marriage.

00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:15.241
I think all marriages go through stages,

00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:18.401
you can't stand each
other, you go through,

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.841
I think, oh God, I hate
him I wish he'd get out.

00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:25.001
I do and I'm sure he does about me.

00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:29.641
- I been in positions you
know and it's hard to say

00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:32.681
in front of Debbie but
it's true, it's tempting,

00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.281
you take the bait.

00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:36.521
You know I go on holiday once
a year with the boys type

00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:39.601
of thing to Spain, Magaluf
and we have a golf holiday.

00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:42.961
All against Debbie's will but it's true,

00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:46.721
I get in situations out there that you,

00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.601
life is for the living.

00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:52.881
And I come back, "Oh I know
what you've been doing out

00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:54.601
"there, you've been
meeting all them birds",

00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:59.601
and whatever and they
look at you as if to say

00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.721
"I know, and I don't want to know".

00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:03.881
That's how it is.

00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:05.961
- Who's to say in another 10 years me

00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:07.521
and him might have split up?

00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:08.361
- Quite possible.

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:11.561
- You know, you don't know.

00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:12.401
- If you were to break up

00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:13.761
what do you think it would be over?

00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:18.001
- Yeah, I think it's be the other party.

00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:20.401
It wouldn't be for the
kids cause the kids they're

00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:23.841
everything, without
anything prior to that.

00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:29.441
Isn't it, I mean it'd break my heart.

00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:31.641
Knowing that another
man could come in here

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.161
and bring my kids up.

00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:35.601
There's only one ambition
really, I want a baby son

00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:37.521
and if I see my baby son

00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:38.721
then I'll see my ambition fulfilled.

00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:40.761
No one knows that, only you now.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.681
- Tony and
Debbie had a son, Nicky,

00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:46.561
who is now 13.

00:06:46.561 --> 00:06:48.961
They have 2 daughters, Jody and Perry

00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:50.641
and the family lives in North London.

00:06:50.641 --> 00:06:53.921
- Now listen, on Saturday
Tottenham have got the Arsenal.

00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:57.201
- One, I was expecting on
28 UP wasn't I when you were

00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:01.001
filmed that but I lost that baby.

00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:03.521
I didn't feel that I could have any more.

00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:05.601
I really didn't want any more.

00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:07.881
But then anyway I did and I had Perry.

00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:11.881
They are naughty, very naughty.

00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:13.001
They're the naughtiest kids I know.

00:07:14.281 --> 00:07:19.121
Nicky's like me, he's more
placid but Jody's like

00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:20.361
how he was when he was 7.

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.641
I do discipline them,
you know, I smack them,

00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:27.961
I put them in their rooms,
I take things off of them.

00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:31.321
I do it, I discipline
them and he undoes it

00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:35.561
so I'm fighting twice with
them, it makes it harder for me

00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:38.641
because he's too soft with them.

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:39.801
- Why do you think
you're too soft with them?

00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:41.561
- Cause I love them so much.

00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:44.041
- Do you bring them up the way

00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:45.481
that you were brought up?

00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:47.361
- The upbringing I
had I saw more dinner times

00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:49.721
than dinners without any questions

00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:53.001
and I did have my brothers
clothes on my back for

00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:55.161
you know hand me downs.

00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:57.081
It's never done me no harm.

00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:59.041
- I wouldn't have
got away with my parents

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:00.321
what my kids get away with me.

00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:01.161
- Yeah but in saying that you do

00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:04.201
give them everything possible.

00:08:04.201 --> 00:08:06.081
All these designer clothes type of thing,

00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:10.281
the Naff gear and Reebok
trainers now my Nicky

00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:16.601
plays football and she'll say
"Oh Nicky wants some trainers

00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:18.361
"have you got £70"?

00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:22.521
and I'll say "What £70
for a pair of trainers,

00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:24.161
"hold on there's a stall around there,

00:08:24.161 --> 00:08:28.761
"same quality trainers
for £24 or something".

00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:31.001
She'll go "£24, oh no" she'll say

00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:34.721
"He can't go to school
wearing that rubbish".

00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:37.961
She'll give them
everything, got an old bike,

00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:39.001
wants a chain putting on and a

00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:41.361
few nuts tightening or whatever.

00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:44.281
"Oh can't have that bike, get a new one"

00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:45.921
then in the next Christmas comes up.

00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:47.561
- Only cause you don't put
the chain and bolts on.

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:48.761
- Oh, I'm not having that one.

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:49.721
- What will you do if you don't

00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:50.721
make it as a jockey?

00:08:51.841 --> 00:08:54.281
- I don't know, if I know I couldn't be one

00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:55.281
I'd get out of the game.

00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:01.881
- What do you
think you would do then?

00:09:01.881 --> 00:09:03.361
- Learn taxis.

00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:06.281
- At 21 Tony
was on the knowledge learning

00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:07.561
to be a London Cabbie.

00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:10.241
- If there's any
person who thinks I can't be

00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:11.641
a Cabbie then they're wrong.

00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:13.681
I'm going to get that badge and I'm going

00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:15.321
to put it right in their face.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.761
Just to tell them how wrong they can be

00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.401
and how underestimated I am.

00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:21.561
- At 28 he had his own cab.

00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:24.601
- Surprising who you pick up you see.

00:09:25.641 --> 00:09:30.041
I once met Kojak I picked
him up and Warren Mitchell,

00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:32.961
Alf Garnett you know.

00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:36.321
Debbie's working in
the day so Debbie'll be

00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:39.401
on her way home by 4
o'clock, the kids'll be

00:09:39.401 --> 00:09:40.401
coming home for tea.

00:09:41.321 --> 00:09:43.081
Debbie'll stop the cab outside,

00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:44.761
come in and cook the dinner.

00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:48.361
Then I'll sit down with the
kids till about 7 whatever,

00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:52.601
then I'll start the cab up
because we work the same cab

00:09:53.481 --> 00:09:57.801
and I'll go to work till
about 1 until it goes again.

00:09:58.721 --> 00:09:59.961
She's got a great mind.

00:09:59.961 --> 00:10:03.401
She does the knowledge
which is less than 2 years.

00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:05.601
For a woman with 3 kids, the pressures,

00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:08.081
running a family that's remarkable.

00:10:10.241 --> 00:10:14.241
- You get a lot of resentment
still from other cab drivers.

00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:16.121
Some of them they just give you abuse,

00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:18.401
some of them just sit there

00:10:18.401 --> 00:10:20.521
shaking their heads when they see you.

00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:24.401
I get told to go home and
do the dishes or go home

00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:26.721
and do your husband's dinner.

00:10:29.481 --> 00:10:32.961
I went to a Knowledge School
and there I met other girls

00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:37.601
doing the Knowledge and
we became quite friendly,

00:10:37.601 --> 00:10:40.961
we meet on a certain rank at Knightsbridge

00:10:40.961 --> 00:10:43.401
and we go and have a cup of
tea we have a look around

00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:48.321
Harrods, get a sandwich,
use Harrod's loos.

00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:51.681
Have a little look around, spray
the perfumes and lipsticks.

00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:56.041
- Does he do his
fair share of the housework?

00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:57.521
- No, he doesn't do a thing.

00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:00.721
He doesn't even bring a cup from one room

00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:02.641
to the other I do everything.

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:05.121
- Sounds awful don't it?

00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:06.801
- Terrible.

00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:08.801
- I'm not chauvinistic,
don't get me wrong you know,

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.241
it's not a question of that.

00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:16.361
I've a very luxurious life indoors right?

00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:19.921
And I'm not proud to say
it or ashamed to say it

00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:21.281
I'm just the way I am.

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:24.161
I mean I work as hard as I can outside

00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:26.601
and when I close that door the feet go up

00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:28.721
and I feel I deserve a rest.

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:30.721
- Would everybody
please sit round now

00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:31.561
and get on with their work.

00:11:31.561 --> 00:11:33.641
I don't want to see any backs to me.

00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:36.561
Shouldn't be anybody turning around.

00:11:36.561 --> 00:11:38.121
Tony do you hear as well?

00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:41.961
Get on with your work in front.

00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:47.081
Tony, don't turn round again.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.961
- So what advantages
do you think you've had

00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:51.201
over some of the other
people that we filmed?

00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:55.241
- Academically they've
probably had more advantages

00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:57.801
over me owing to the fact
they've had prep schools

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.161
at a very early age you know.

00:11:59.161 --> 00:12:03.241
They've benefited by it which
you know it tells obviously

00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:06.481
in this film but as far
as you know the stability

00:12:06.481 --> 00:12:08.801
and the background you
know with their parents

00:12:10.281 --> 00:12:11.641
they've missed out on that.

00:12:13.561 --> 00:12:17.841
It was February the 9th
exactly 10 minutes past 9.

00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:23.241
Mothers having her last, well
at the time we never knew,

00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:27.881
her last breath, and she just died

00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:35.521
with me holding her hand

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:38.801
and it was the worst moment of my life.

00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:45.081
With respect to Debbie,
she was and still is

00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:48.641
the best girl in the world.

00:12:50.521 --> 00:12:55.521
I'm sorry but Eastenders
they're all close to their mums

00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:58.481
and you know like everyone else wherever

00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:01.681
you come from but my mom and I,

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:04.041
I've made it clear from when we done 21.

00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:12.041
I just loved her, that's why.

00:13:13.161 --> 00:13:14.761
That's what I think isn't it.

00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:18.001
- I've never met anyone
like his mum in my life.

00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:19.761
I doubt I ever will.

00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:22.481
She was a lovely lady,
she was a friend to me

00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:25.881
she wasn't a mother in law and we used

00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:28.401
to go everywhere together me and his mum.

00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:31.521
- I know the old man
from the time of his life

00:13:31.521 --> 00:13:34.321
afterwards he died there and then

00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:37.961
but he walked around
until September this year.

00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:40.561
- When you buried him what

00:13:40.561 --> 00:13:42.321
did you put in his coffin?

00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:49.521
- I put 3 cards and I put
crown and anchor dice,

00:13:49.521 --> 00:13:51.081
oh and a betting slip and a pen.

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.881
Because that was my dads whole life.

00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:56.961
I'm at the graveside, I'm talking to her,

00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:00.601
I've got all images running
through my mind saying like

00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:03.841
"Tony go downstairs get
me five weights you know,

00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:06.401
"and one and a penny" and
I used to go in the shop.

00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:09.001
She used to throw the
cotton in a hair curler

00:14:09.001 --> 00:14:13.241
over the landing and I
used to tie the cigarettes

00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:16.841
on this bit of cotton and
she used to pull them up

00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:18.361
and you'd see her in the end,

00:14:18.361 --> 00:14:22.321
"Thanks Tone see you
after school be good".

00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:25.801
And that's the way it was, and
all little things like that.

00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:28.641
Mother having a drink in
the pub, singing, don't care

00:14:28.641 --> 00:14:32.401
a monkeys she used to say,
don't care about nothing.

00:14:32.401 --> 00:14:36.241
The poshies, "Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes".

00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:41.561
They're nuts, just have to touch them.

00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:45.961
Yeah well they can get
what they want can't they?

00:14:45.961 --> 00:14:48.601
If you've got to work for it
and it's them, they can just

00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:50.281
ask for money and they get it.

00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:52.161
They can buy what they want.

00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:53.801
I'm not a politician so let them worry

00:14:53.801 --> 00:14:56.641
about whats coming for the next day.

00:14:56.641 --> 00:15:00.361
All I understand is dogs,
prices, girls, knowledge,

00:15:00.361 --> 00:15:04.001
roads, streets, squares
and mum and dad and love.

00:15:04.001 --> 00:15:06.561
That's all I understand, that's
all I want to understand.

00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:09.041
- How long are you
going to be a cab driver,

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.161
is this what you want to do
for the rest of your life?

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:14.481
- Well at the moment, I'm
very happy in driving a cab

00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:19.121
but I always considered owning
our own pub so obviously

00:15:19.121 --> 00:15:23.921
I think with two or three
years, once I get finally,

00:15:23.921 --> 00:15:26.281
financially straightened
out I'm going to have a go

00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:27.881
at being a publican.

00:15:27.881 --> 00:15:31.161
We did eventually get a pub
about 18 months after wasn't it?

00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:32.361
- Yeah.

00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:36.481
- And we went in partnership
with my brother in law

00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:41.001
and I saw the pub going in one direction,

00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:43.761
he saw it going in another one and after

00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:46.041
about eight months or a year wasn't it?

00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:49.081
We decided to call it a day.

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:50.721
Next time it's hard work out there.

00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:51.561
- You're not reaching me yet.

00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:54.201
- At 28 Tony
was taking acting lessons.

00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:56.121
- Be bigger, dominate me.

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:59.041
- Son, son it's a big world out there

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:00.361
and obviously I'm not.

00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:01.481
I can't get into it Brian.

00:16:01.481 --> 00:16:02.561
- All right, all right.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.801
- Pardon the expression but
could you do my inside leg.

00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:06.681
- He now works as an extra.

00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:11.201
- I'll have a go at
anything, especially acting,

00:16:11.201 --> 00:16:13.441
but talent, who am I to say?

00:16:13.441 --> 00:16:15.041
I'm not going to say I
haven't but then again

00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:16.801
who's to stay anyone has?

00:16:16.801 --> 00:16:20.921
I promise you, it's just
the job, no more no less.

00:16:22.241 --> 00:16:25.401
All that big ideas for
stardom probably happened

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:29.161
14 years ago, I mean, but
not now, don't mean nothing

00:16:29.161 --> 00:16:30.161
believe it or not.

00:16:31.201 --> 00:16:33.281
I don't want to change because if I change

00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:36.721
it proves the other Tony
Walker was all fake.

00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:41.321
I know, and I've always said
it, there's never ever a thing

00:16:41.321 --> 00:16:43.881
in my life I've never set out to do

00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:44.961
that I've never achieved.

00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:47.241
I wanted to be a jockey thank God,

00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:50.121
I rode in a race with
Lester Piggott and I did it.

00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:52.321
I wanted to be in the
film game, I got in it.

00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:54.881
Working with Stephen Spielberg for 2 weeks

00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:56.881
on one of his films.

00:16:56.881 --> 00:16:59.041
I made it happen on my terms

00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:01.761
and no one can say "I helped him"

00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:04.801
and I'm a lot stronger in that respect.

00:17:04.801 --> 00:17:05.841
- But you didn't pull it off.

00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:08.041
You didn't pull a jockey
off, you haven't made it

00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:10.481
as an actor, you didn't pull off the pub.

00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:13.001
- Well, it's better to
be a has been than a

00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:14.041
never was wasn't it?

00:17:15.001 --> 00:17:17.241
My ambitions have gone out the window now

00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:20.921
cause I'm running a family,
I'm playing a role now.

00:17:20.921 --> 00:17:23.561
That is my role in life
I feel, but in saying

00:17:23.561 --> 00:17:26.681
that coming to the age of
34 I've done everything

00:17:26.681 --> 00:17:28.881
what I wanted to do.

00:17:29.881 --> 00:17:33.961
I've got no regrets other than
not making it as a jockey,

00:17:33.961 --> 00:17:38.281
that is my only regret but we
all live on dreams sometimes

00:17:38.281 --> 00:17:41.081
If they don't come off unlucky,
you go again some time.

00:17:44.681 --> 00:17:47.001
- Tell me do you
have any boyfriends Suzi?

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:51.761
- Erm, yes.

00:17:51.761 --> 00:17:54.081
- Tell me about them.

00:17:54.081 --> 00:17:58.161
- Well he lives up in Scotland
and he's I think he's 13

00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.321
and I'm rather lonely up
there because he usually goes

00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:08.401
to school but we used to
play till about half past 6

00:18:09.441 --> 00:18:12.561
when he comes home from
school, then we go in

00:18:12.561 --> 00:18:16.961
and then he goes home to do his homework.

00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:18.321
- Have you
got any boyfriends Suzi?

00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:28.281
- What is your attitude
towards marriage for yourself?

00:18:32.721 --> 00:18:33.961
- Well, I don't know, I
haven't given it a lot

00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:36.841
of thought cause I'm very
very cynical about it.

00:18:40.481 --> 00:18:42.681
But then you get a certain
amount of faith resorted in it

00:18:42.681 --> 00:18:46.081
when I mean, I've got
friends and their parents

00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:48.721
are happily married and
so it does put faith back

00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:51.161
into you but me myself
I'm very cynical about it.

00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:54.881
- When I last saw
you at 21 you were nervous

00:18:54.881 --> 00:18:57.081
you were chain smoking you were uptight

00:18:57.081 --> 00:19:00.681
and now you seem happy,
whats happened to you

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:02.841
over these last 7 years?

00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:07.321
- I suppose Rupert, I'll
give you some credit.

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.361
- I'm now chain smoking.

00:19:14.441 --> 00:19:17.281
- I think you can't just
walk through marriage

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:19.521
and think once you get
married it's all going

00:19:19.521 --> 00:19:23.281
to be roses and everything
for ever you know you have,

00:19:26.441 --> 00:19:29.241
well everybody has had their
rows but we've never yet

00:19:29.241 --> 00:19:31.521
had a row that we haven't
managed to sort out

00:19:33.801 --> 00:19:37.121
and I reckon really we've got a pretty,

00:19:37.121 --> 00:19:38.801
pretty good marriage.

00:19:38.801 --> 00:19:41.801
When I get married I'd
like to have 2 children.

00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:45.441
I'm not very children minded at the moment

00:19:45.441 --> 00:19:46.681
I don't know if I ever will be.

00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:50.481
- What do you think about them?

00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:51.841
- Well I don't like babies.

00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:54.641
- What was the
biggest shocks to you

00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:57.881
when you suddenly were
confronted with a small baby

00:19:57.881 --> 00:20:00.601
that you had to be responsible for?

00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:02.481
- Panic set in I think.

00:20:02.481 --> 00:20:05.001
That I wasn't going to be able to cope.

00:20:05.001 --> 00:20:07.041
- Is it everything you wanted?

00:20:07.041 --> 00:20:09.081
- For the moment yes,
I mean I don't think I'll have

00:20:09.081 --> 00:20:11.961
any more for the reason
that I will get pleasure

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:14.921
out of these two but I can't
see me going on and on and on.

00:20:16.641 --> 00:20:17.561
- Mummy.

00:20:17.561 --> 00:20:18.401
- Yes.

00:20:18.401 --> 00:20:19.241
- Laura wants you.

00:20:19.241 --> 00:20:20.121
- Very little has changed.

00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:22.561
My life is probably very
much the same as it was then.

00:20:22.561 --> 00:20:24.961
I've had another baby, we've moved house,

00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:26.001
and that's about all.

00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:30.281
Thomas is at a prep
school now he's a day boy

00:20:31.601 --> 00:20:33.241
which he enjoys.

00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:34.561
Oliver's at school

00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:36.361
and Laura's just started this week.

00:20:38.241 --> 00:20:40.321
- Is discipline important?

00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:44.041
- Yes, it must be, I
wouldn't want to bring up

00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:45.681
3 unruly rude children.

00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:50.041
I'd hate people to look at
my children and think ugh,

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.921
they don't want to have
them for the day cause

00:20:52.921 --> 00:20:54.681
they're so badly behaved and rude

00:20:54.681 --> 00:20:56.761
but then you know some days
you can spend you whole day

00:20:56.761 --> 00:20:59.881
just shouting at them because
they're behaving so badly.

00:21:01.041 --> 00:21:02.001
- Would you like having a nanny

00:21:02.001 --> 00:21:04.041
to look after them or do
you want to look after them?

00:21:05.361 --> 00:21:08.641
- No I want a nanny to look after them.

00:21:10.081 --> 00:21:12.481
We didn't have a third child because

00:21:12.481 --> 00:21:14.881
we desperately wanted to have a daughter.

00:21:14.881 --> 00:21:16.641
I mean you know, there's
no point doing that,

00:21:16.641 --> 00:21:19.241
but it was lovely when she was a girl

00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:21.721
because I feel the boys will
go off with Rupert fishing

00:21:21.721 --> 00:21:24.161
and stuff and I shall be left on my own

00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:26.241
so it'll be nice to have
a girl around the place.

00:21:30.001 --> 00:21:33.361
Oliver's a very volatile child it's him

00:21:33.361 --> 00:21:35.601
and I that have the problems.

00:21:35.601 --> 00:21:36.761
Right from the minute

00:21:36.761 --> 00:21:38.921
he was born he screamed day and night

00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:40.401
and he's never got any better.

00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:47.721
He's got learning difficulties,
dyslexia may come into it,

00:21:47.721 --> 00:21:48.641
we don't know yet.

00:21:49.881 --> 00:21:52.161
I think he would benefit
from being at a school

00:21:52.161 --> 00:21:54.961
where he's where he can cope better.

00:21:56.241 --> 00:21:58.761
- As a teenager,
Suzi spent her holidays

00:21:58.761 --> 00:22:01.281
on her fathers estate in Scotland.

00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:03.161
What sort of things do you do?

00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:06.481
- Ride, swim, play tennis, ping pong.

00:22:08.761 --> 00:22:11.201
I might play croquet, things like that.

00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:19.281
- What about the
social life, whats that?

00:22:19.281 --> 00:22:20.641
- What in Perthshire?

00:22:20.641 --> 00:22:21.441
- Yes.

00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:22.281
- Mm, quite fun.

00:22:22.281 --> 00:22:25.681
I came to London when I
left school after Paris

00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:28.841
and at the moment I could
never live in the country.

00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:33.841
I'm happy down here I mean
the country's nice for 4 days

00:22:34.201 --> 00:22:36.841
to go for long healthy walks but I mean

00:22:36.841 --> 00:22:38.361
I could never live up there now.

00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:42.521
- This is a wonderful atmosphere

00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:44.281
to bring up children.

00:22:44.281 --> 00:22:45.841
Do you think in some way it might be

00:22:45.841 --> 00:22:47.761
too secluded and safe for them?

00:22:49.041 --> 00:22:49.881
- It could be.

00:22:49.881 --> 00:22:52.041
That's something that
slightly frightens me

00:22:52.041 --> 00:22:54.321
that it is it's a very cosseted
life that they have here

00:22:54.321 --> 00:22:57.361
and they've got to hit
the world at some point.

00:22:57.361 --> 00:23:00.881
I just hope that I can
help them cope with it.

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:04.641
It is the most carefree time of your life.

00:23:04.641 --> 00:23:07.081
I'm not saying it is for all children.

00:23:07.081 --> 00:23:10.761
Well any child going through
their parents splitting up

00:23:10.761 --> 00:23:14.161
aged 14 you're at a very
vulnerable age and it does cut

00:23:14.161 --> 00:23:18.161
you up but you know, you get over it.

00:23:19.641 --> 00:23:22.401
There's no point them
staying together for me

00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:26.081
because it was worse I
mean the rows, it's worse.

00:23:26.081 --> 00:23:27.561
If two people can't live together

00:23:27.561 --> 00:23:29.241
there's no point making yourself.

00:23:30.321 --> 00:23:35.041
I hope by Rupert and I giving
them a close family unit

00:23:35.041 --> 00:23:37.801
that they'll keep their
heads and won't feel

00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:40.441
that they're slightly lost like I did.

00:23:41.721 --> 00:23:45.481
Where I wasted time was
in my middle late teens

00:23:45.481 --> 00:23:47.481
and I think at that stage I didn't care.

00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:50.681
I just let those years
go really, I drifted

00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:53.961
and it's too late now to look back.

00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:59.401
When I leave school
I'm down for Heathfield

00:23:59.401 --> 00:24:03.161
and Southover Manor and
then maybe I may want

00:24:03.161 --> 00:24:06.641
to go to a University but
I don't know which one yet.

00:24:07.601 --> 00:24:11.481
I'd like to do maybe shorthand typing

00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:12.321
or something like that.

00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:14.801
I left school when I was 16, went to Paris

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:20.721
went to secretarial college and got a job.

00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:22.161
- What made you decide

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:23.801
to leave school and go to Paris?

00:24:25.561 --> 00:24:27.201
- I just wasn't interested in school

00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:28.601
and just wanted to get away.

00:24:30.001 --> 00:24:32.401
- I was a partner in
a quite a big law firm

00:24:32.401 --> 00:24:35.761
and I resigned from that
set up my own company.

00:24:37.921 --> 00:24:41.161
I tend to specialise in
refurbishing old buildings

00:24:41.161 --> 00:24:42.801
and converting them into offices.

00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:46.801
- Well if Rupert's
still got his property company

00:24:46.801 --> 00:24:50.321
in this present economic
climate, I'd like to get

00:24:50.321 --> 00:24:51.521
more involved with that.

00:24:52.961 --> 00:24:54.641
It was a very difficult time when Rupert

00:24:54.641 --> 00:24:56.641
was deciding to leave.

00:24:56.641 --> 00:24:58.081
He's got a lot of responsibilities

00:24:58.081 --> 00:24:59.401
with all of us and it's not easy

00:24:59.401 --> 00:25:00.681
just starting off on your own.

00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:03.081
- Do you ever
worry that the roof might

00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:06.881
fall in and you'll be
out of this and whatever?

00:25:06.881 --> 00:25:09.481
- Yes, it crosses my mind.

00:25:09.481 --> 00:25:12.481
Last year, it's quite,

00:25:12.481 --> 00:25:15.481
it's crossed my mind
quite hard that we might,

00:25:15.481 --> 00:25:18.721
you know we could lose this
if things don't pick up.

00:25:20.401 --> 00:25:23.641
- When she was 28
Suzy's father had just died.

00:25:24.881 --> 00:25:27.681
- It's very hard to describe to somebody

00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:29.641
how you just take the loss.

00:25:29.641 --> 00:25:32.601
It is terribly hard, even
now I still can't believe

00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:33.961
my fathers not here.

00:25:35.001 --> 00:25:37.721
It's still sinking in I think.

00:25:39.081 --> 00:25:41.961
The death of one of your
close family is probably

00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:43.521
something you don't ever get over

00:25:43.521 --> 00:25:47.121
and it's a different kind of
problem than anything else.

00:25:48.761 --> 00:25:50.921
- Tell me about your mum.

00:25:50.921 --> 00:25:53.841
- She was diagnosed before
Christmas as having lung cancer

00:25:55.241 --> 00:25:57.721
but she's strong, she's tough

00:25:57.721 --> 00:26:00.521
and hopefully she'll pull her way of it.

00:26:01.561 --> 00:26:06.521
She's just had a horrendous
operation, she's still in

00:26:06.521 --> 00:26:08.521
hospital now in a lot of pain.

00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:10.921
You see someone in pain like

00:26:10.921 --> 00:26:13.801
that it's especially someone that you love

00:26:13.801 --> 00:26:16.041
and care for, it's it's very hard.

00:26:18.561 --> 00:26:22.401
Somehow I think when
you're faced with it you

00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:23.641
just find inner strength.

00:26:23.641 --> 00:26:27.241
I think you think
beforehand something awful

00:26:27.241 --> 00:26:29.721
you can't cope with it but
somehow when it's there

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.481
you just get on.

00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:36.401
Someone somehow gives you
inner strength to cope with it.

00:26:36.401 --> 00:26:39.001
- What do you think
about making this programme?

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:44.241
- I just think it's ridiculous,

00:26:44.241 --> 00:26:46.081
I don't see any point in doing it.

00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:49.961
The first year or two after 28 UP came out

00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:54.041
you know I'd meet people,
or people in shops

00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:57.041
would ask me whether I was the
girl that did the programme

00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:00.641
and that's quite hard
because it's churning up

00:27:00.641 --> 00:27:03.281
all happy memories, sad memories,

00:27:03.281 --> 00:27:06.801
and it all comes flooding back, parts

00:27:06.801 --> 00:27:08.481
that I'd rather forget and it's all

00:27:08.481 --> 00:27:09.881
there for people to see.

00:27:10.961 --> 00:27:13.041
Although most people are
quite nice about it you get

00:27:13.041 --> 00:27:18.041
the odd one who's fairly
rude and I just think they're

00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:21.921
lucky then they didn't have
to have it done to them.

00:27:27.881 --> 00:27:31.441
I've had a very privileged
life compared to some people.

00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:36.161
I've never really had to
struggle to make my way

00:27:36.161 --> 00:27:38.361
but I don't think I've taken for granted

00:27:38.361 --> 00:27:39.561
what I've had either.

00:27:40.721 --> 00:27:42.081
This may sound very arrogant

00:27:42.081 --> 00:27:46.801
but you can't if I let it
worry me I mean I'd worry

00:27:46.801 --> 00:27:49.841
myself to death, I can't
change what I was born into.

00:27:54.641 --> 00:27:59.641
- Well, going to Africa
and try and teach people

00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:04.641
who are not civilised
to be more or less good.

00:28:05.321 --> 00:28:08.241
No I don't want to be a missionary
because I just can't talk

00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:09.201
about it to people.

00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:12.721
I am interested in it myself

00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:16.241
but I wouldn't be very good at it at all.

00:28:23.561 --> 00:28:26.601
- So is this your
missionary dream come true?

00:28:26.601 --> 00:28:30.361
- Well not exactly, I'm
a teacher now in London

00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:33.761
and I've had the opportunity
to come here for a term

00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:37.881
and it just so happens the
school I am in has great links

00:28:37.881 --> 00:28:42.241
with this part of the world
and you know I've come here

00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:46.841
to find out about the
background of many of the boys

00:28:46.841 --> 00:28:48.241
that I teach back in London.

00:28:49.921 --> 00:28:52.641
- At 35 Bruce
is working in Sylhet,

00:28:52.641 --> 00:28:55.481
a town in the north east
corner of Bangladesh.

00:28:58.921 --> 00:29:00.961
- Well I'm earning my
keep by teaching maths

00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:03.081
and helping the teachers here,

00:29:03.081 --> 00:29:04.961
helping them design courses of study.

00:29:06.401 --> 00:29:09.681
I'm also teaching them English,
they've all got quite good

00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:13.361
English but practising
and improving their English

00:29:13.361 --> 00:29:16.321
and then I've also got the
chance to learn a bit of Bangla

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:19.721
which is very difficult and
I'm not doing very well at all.

00:29:19.721 --> 00:29:22.881
- Bangladesh,
Bangladesh, Bangladesh.

00:29:22.881 --> 00:29:24.121
- Bangladesh.

00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:25.081
- Bangladesh.

00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:25.921
- Bangladesh.

00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:26.761
- Mango.

00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:27.961
- Mango.

00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:28.801
- Ahm.

00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:29.641
- Ahm.

00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:36.881
- Vasto, Vastos, vastat,
vastons, vastones, vastat.

00:29:37.481 --> 00:29:38.801
- Yeah speak up.

00:29:39.881 --> 00:29:42.321
- At 7 Bruce
was at a pre-preparatory

00:29:42.321 --> 00:29:47.321
boarding school, at 14 St
Paul's school in London.

00:29:48.361 --> 00:29:52.241
- They don't sort of
enforce being upper class

00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:55.961
and things like that at St Paul's.

00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.601
They suggest that you don't have long hair

00:29:58.601 --> 00:30:00.241
and they do get it cut if.

00:30:02.721 --> 00:30:05.281
They teach you to be
reasonably well mannered

00:30:05.281 --> 00:30:08.121
but not to sniff on the poorer people.

00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:11.321
- At 21 he was in his

00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:13.601
last year at Oxford reading maths.

00:30:17.401 --> 00:30:19.361
- You can show that this is irreducible

00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:22.841
then you do a transformation
on this polynomial,

00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:24.241
x equal to t plus two.

00:30:24.241 --> 00:30:27.241
- Good, that's a nice way of
doing it, particularly using

00:30:27.241 --> 00:30:29.001
Einstein down here.

00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:30.761
His test is very powerful.

00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:32.521
- I won't carry on with mathematics,

00:30:32.521 --> 00:30:34.361
I don't think I'll be a teacher.

00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:35.761
Chris Soarabe.

00:30:35.761 --> 00:30:36.601
- Yes sir.

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:38.481
- At 28 he was teaching,

00:30:38.481 --> 00:30:40.681
immigrant children in East London.

00:30:40.681 --> 00:30:42.721
- And to here, 25.

00:30:42.721 --> 00:30:43.881
Now it cost you 24, now
you're not going to.

00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:46.081
- It's so different
from your own education

00:30:46.081 --> 00:30:48.481
where you're teaching now, why?

00:30:48.481 --> 00:30:52.801
- General education is
better for society I think.

00:30:52.801 --> 00:30:54.681
Public schools are divisive,

00:30:54.681 --> 00:30:56.801
that's with no statement
about my education.

00:30:56.801 --> 00:31:00.121
My education was academically excellent

00:31:00.121 --> 00:31:02.161
and I was very grateful for it.

00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:04.401
I think there is a class society

00:31:04.401 --> 00:31:09.401
and I think public schools
may help its continuance.

00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:13.121
- At 35 in Sylhet

00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:14.921
he is teaching the older students.

00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:19.361
- I see education as
a key to it all I mean once

00:31:19.361 --> 00:31:23.161
your population becomes
educated it can think for itself

00:31:23.161 --> 00:31:25.881
a lot more and create wealth
and create opportunities.

00:31:25.881 --> 00:31:29.441
Good, because you've
got to get an x squared.

00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:32.601
Now when we come to the village we're

00:31:32.601 --> 00:31:34.201
definitely going to go swimming.

00:31:34.201 --> 00:31:36.441
- What do you like about Sylhet?

00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:39.241
- Well I think mainly the
people and their hospitality.

00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:43.961
A couple of weeks ago I
went on a visit to a family

00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:46.121
with a teacher from this school.

00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:48.441
They lived in a one room
flat but we were immediately

00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:51.641
invited in and we sat
around having food with them

00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:54.281
and that's what hospitality means.

00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:56.801
If I was back in England and I turned up

00:31:56.801 --> 00:31:58.481
say at a friends an hour before

00:31:58.481 --> 00:32:02.041
lunch with three people
they'd never met they'd say

00:32:02.041 --> 00:32:04.001
well lets go down the pub or something.

00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:06.601
I didn't agree with the Conservatives

00:32:06.601 --> 00:32:09.721
about what they were doing
with the black people,

00:32:09.721 --> 00:32:11.321
you know, racial policy.

00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:16.441
Everybody has the capacity
to be racist wherever

00:32:16.441 --> 00:32:17.801
you are in the world.

00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:21.241
I think it's a natural
human condition to be afraid

00:32:21.241 --> 00:32:24.641
of something that's slightly
different to you I think

00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:25.761
that that's the basis of it.

00:32:25.761 --> 00:32:28.401
I mean I know academically it's defined

00:32:28.401 --> 00:32:30.441
as prejudice plus power.

00:32:30.441 --> 00:32:32.121
When you've got the power to do something

00:32:32.121 --> 00:32:36.441
about it you can turn it
into something very damaging

00:32:36.441 --> 00:32:38.721
to the person who's receiving it.

00:32:38.721 --> 00:32:41.881
I think if you recognise that
as an emotional condition

00:32:41.881 --> 00:32:45.121
maybe you can use your
intellect to check yourself.

00:32:47.281 --> 00:32:49.601
- Has a country
like this got any future?

00:32:50.641 --> 00:32:52.641
- I think it needs an awful lot of help.

00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:55.721
The amount of general
poverty I think is growing.

00:32:55.721 --> 00:32:58.961
You see so many children
working I mean it used to be

00:32:58.961 --> 00:33:02.641
a rich area 200 years ago
and more people would call it

00:33:02.641 --> 00:33:04.561
the Pearl of the Bay of Bengal.

00:33:04.561 --> 00:33:07.401
People wondered at it
and it's not that now

00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:12.401
and that's not unconnected
with the British rule here.

00:33:13.001 --> 00:33:16.201
Basically we don't care
that many countries

00:33:16.201 --> 00:33:20.241
are incredibly poor, we
simply don't care I mean we do

00:33:21.761 --> 00:33:24.881
raise money for charity and
so on, which is excellent,

00:33:24.881 --> 00:33:28.841
but it's simply not good
enough at the end of the day.

00:33:28.841 --> 00:33:33.841
Well my girlfriend is in
Africa and I don't think

00:33:34.601 --> 00:33:37.681
I'll have another chance
of seeing her again.

00:33:37.681 --> 00:33:39.521
- Have you got any girlfriends?

00:33:39.521 --> 00:33:44.521
- No, no not yet, I'm sure
it will come but not yet.

00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:49.201
I mean I do think a lot of
people think too much about it.

00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:53.161
- What happened
when you burnt your fingers?

00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:59.241
- Erm, I'd rather not talk about it.

00:34:01.961 --> 00:34:05.401
Well no, I don't really mean
that I mean I don't mean

00:34:05.401 --> 00:34:06.721
that I don't want to talk about it just

00:34:06.721 --> 00:34:09.321
that I'd need quite a long
time to think about it.

00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:14.001
I think I'd very much
like to become involved

00:34:17.401 --> 00:34:18.401
in a family life.

00:34:18.401 --> 00:34:19.881
My own family for a start.

00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:23.521
It's a need that I feel I ought to fulfil

00:34:23.521 --> 00:34:26.281
and would like to fulfil
and would do it well.

00:34:26.281 --> 00:34:29.361
Yes I haven't got married
or whatever and I suppose

00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:32.281
that would've been something
which I hoped would happen,

00:34:34.521 --> 00:34:38.321
you know I suppose lots of reasons really,

00:34:38.321 --> 00:34:40.681
I don't suppose I've met the right person.

00:34:40.681 --> 00:34:41.681
Well about 10 minutes.

00:34:41.681 --> 00:34:43.881
I mean you just read out an article.

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:46.721
I'm still a bit shy and
awkward, still have a bit

00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:48.081
of growing up to do sometimes,

00:34:48.081 --> 00:34:51.401
I think I'm a little
bit immature sometimes.

00:34:51.401 --> 00:34:56.361
I can have quite sort
of teenage like crushes

00:34:56.361 --> 00:35:01.361
on people and I can see
myself falling into it

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:04.721
and know exactly whats
happening but sort of unable

00:35:04.721 --> 00:35:05.921
to do anything about it.

00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:10.881
I've had affairs, sometimes they've ended

00:35:10.881 --> 00:35:13.881
quite naturally with
goodwill on both sides.

00:35:15.241 --> 00:35:18.041
Maybe I just haven't met the right person.

00:35:18.041 --> 00:35:20.561
- Well you're getting
on a bit aren't you worried?

00:35:20.561 --> 00:35:23.561
- Well not particularly,
I'm always optimistic.

00:35:23.561 --> 00:35:27.281
Who knows who I might
meet tomorrow but I think

00:35:27.281 --> 00:35:29.001
that's the trouble with reserve.

00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:31.721
You're not rejected but you
never know what might have been.

00:35:31.721 --> 00:35:35.041
But I'm getting better
you know, year by year.

00:35:35.041 --> 00:35:36.641
I think we all grow up.

00:35:38.161 --> 00:35:39.001
- What are the qualities

00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:39.841
in a woman that you look for?

00:35:41.561 --> 00:35:45.081
- Well, somebody I get on with
I suppose not particularly

00:35:50.121 --> 00:35:52.921
attractive or whatever,
I don't want this to turn

00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:55.881
into a sort of a dating agency video.

00:35:58.201 --> 00:36:03.121
My hearts desire is to see my
Daddy who is 6,000 miles away.

00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:06.561
He died about three years ago.

00:36:06.561 --> 00:36:08.561
He was 72 I mean we did

00:36:08.561 --> 00:36:12.201
drift apart because he
was in Rhodesia, Zimbabwe

00:36:12.201 --> 00:36:14.801
as it now is, he did come back to England

00:36:14.801 --> 00:36:17.761
and retire and I did used to
go up to Yorkshire and see him.

00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:20.921
Not as often as I should've
done, I mean I'm sure

00:36:20.921 --> 00:36:23.321
he had a fond feeling
for me and I'd have liked

00:36:23.321 --> 00:36:25.001
to have returned that in some way.

00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:28.041
- Do you miss him?

00:36:28.041 --> 00:36:30.721
- Well I'd like to have
been able to miss him,

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:34.161
I'd like to have got closer
to be able to miss him.

00:36:34.161 --> 00:36:37.561
I regret that chance of not
getting closer at that time.

00:36:38.481 --> 00:36:42.401
You always need people
to care for you because

00:36:42.401 --> 00:36:45.001
if you disappoint yourself by acting badly

00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:47.841
in a particular way you
tend most to hurt the people

00:36:47.841 --> 00:36:51.481
who love you and where would we be without

00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:52.801
having people to love you.

00:36:55.241 --> 00:36:57.641
- At 28 Bruce was
living in a council flat

00:36:57.641 --> 00:37:00.961
in East London, he's now
in primitive lodgings

00:37:00.961 --> 00:37:02.201
in the middle of Sylhet.

00:37:05.601 --> 00:37:07.081
- Is money important to you?

00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:09.321
- Well not really, I
have enough to live on.

00:37:10.601 --> 00:37:13.681
I don't know whether
teachers deserve more money.

00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:16.321
My gripe's has never been
about money, it's always been

00:37:16.321 --> 00:37:17.921
about horrid conditions of work.

00:37:19.241 --> 00:37:22.561
I find it horrible that people
care so much about money.

00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:25.601
There are many more finer
things in life than that.

00:37:25.601 --> 00:37:27.761
You know, people who bought the shares

00:37:27.761 --> 00:37:31.481
in the privatisation issues
just to make quick money.

00:37:31.481 --> 00:37:34.721
I just thought well, what
are you about in life?

00:37:34.721 --> 00:37:35.801
Is that it?

00:37:37.841 --> 00:37:40.121
You know, I didn't want any part in that.

00:37:44.961 --> 00:37:47.121
- This film
is about opportunity,

00:37:47.121 --> 00:37:50.201
do you think you've made the
most of your opportunities?

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:52.841
- My opportunity was to do what I wanted

00:37:52.841 --> 00:37:54.241
and what I found fulfilling.

00:37:55.361 --> 00:37:59.561
And I had a great variety
because of my background, yes.

00:37:59.561 --> 00:38:01.921
I've made the most of my opportunity

00:38:01.921 --> 00:38:03.281
because I've found something to do

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:06.401
that I find rewarding and
that was my opportunity.

00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:22.801
I see education as being
very important you know,

00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:25.881
which is why I'm distressed by something

00:38:25.881 --> 00:38:28.561
which I see in Bangladesh,
the young kids working

00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:32.401
so hard they need to bring
the money in for their family.

00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:35.801
I'd say education is a
right, the more they learn,

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.161
the more choices they have in life.

00:38:38.161 --> 00:38:40.641
Life should be a rich experience.

00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:48.401
- If we did all love
Geoffrey and we all wanted

00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:51.241
to marry him I think I
know the one that he'd

00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:54.001
like the best and that's her.

00:38:55.761 --> 00:38:57.241
- Plenty of boyfriends but not one.

00:38:57.241 --> 00:38:58.841
- Yeah, not one in particular.

00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:01.321
Friends with plenty of boys you know.

00:39:01.321 --> 00:39:06.241
- We had a teacher at school,
his favourite ploy was

00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:10.721
all you girls want to do
is walk out, get married,

00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:12.641
have babies and push
a pram down the street

00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:14.681
with a fag hanging outside your mouth.

00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:19.401
- Women are expanding into
so many different areas now

00:39:19.401 --> 00:39:22.601
that it must be getting
easier, I mean I could still

00:39:22.601 --> 00:39:25.081
be working now and have
a family if I wanted to.

00:39:25.081 --> 00:39:27.961
The number of people in
my situation, single,

00:39:27.961 --> 00:39:29.961
not single parents as such but divorced

00:39:29.961 --> 00:39:32.641
single parents is unbelievable.

00:39:32.641 --> 00:39:34.321
And the people of my mum's generation,

00:39:34.321 --> 00:39:37.361
it's still rare, very rare.

00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:39.801
- If my mum was to contemplate
leaving my dad was far,

00:39:39.801 --> 00:39:42.161
I mean I don't even know
what she would've done.

00:39:43.161 --> 00:39:44.841
Because she never dreamed of
working until the youngest one

00:39:44.841 --> 00:39:47.401
went to school so I
couldn't I couldn't imagine

00:39:47.401 --> 00:39:49.361
where she would've gone
or what she would've done.

00:39:49.361 --> 00:39:51.241
- We haven't got that problem.

00:39:51.241 --> 00:39:54.241
If a relationship is not working then

00:39:55.761 --> 00:39:59.121
it's acceptable in society to bail out.

00:40:01.041 --> 00:40:03.961
- Well I know he is hers and he loves her.

00:40:04.961 --> 00:40:07.601
- I don't I love him.

00:40:07.601 --> 00:40:11.281
- I don't think I'd get married too early,

00:40:12.801 --> 00:40:15.561
I'd like to have a full
life first and meet people

00:40:15.561 --> 00:40:20.001
before you commit yourself to a family.

00:40:20.001 --> 00:40:22.681
- Sue was 24
when she married Billy,

00:40:22.681 --> 00:40:24.921
they had two children,
William and Katherine.

00:40:25.881 --> 00:40:28.201
- I think that to get married
young there must be things

00:40:28.201 --> 00:40:32.361
that you miss, you must
miss that crucial stage

00:40:32.361 --> 00:40:35.041
of being yourself, because
the minute you get married

00:40:35.041 --> 00:40:37.681
you're no longer a single being,

00:40:37.681 --> 00:40:40.641
you're a partnership and that
should be the idea behind it.

00:40:42.081 --> 00:40:44.241
Go on then, you go first, turn it over

00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:45.481
and put it back in the same place.

00:40:45.481 --> 00:40:48.761
Just after we made the
last one I had Katherine

00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:52.961
and then she was about a
year and the marriage started

00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:56.441
to sort of dissolve around
us really and we decided

00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:59.241
to go our separate ways.

00:40:59.241 --> 00:41:00.281
I've never sat down

00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:05.281
and thought what was it,
was it this was it that.

00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:10.641
I just knew it wasn't
working and the discussion

00:41:10.641 --> 00:41:15.081
really was the best way of
splitting up rather than

00:41:16.081 --> 00:41:17.241
why are we splitting up?

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:21.961
It was really strange, I
think it seemed so obvious

00:41:21.961 --> 00:41:25.481
to both of us that it was probably easier

00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:26.961
to do than it should've been.

00:41:28.561 --> 00:41:32.561
I have a regular one night
a week when I can go out.

00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:39.921
It just happens to be that in
this particular circle most

00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:43.001
of them are separated or divorced.

00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:48.201
You have common problems
so sometimes it's easier

00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:51.281
because you recognise each
others problems with babysitters.

00:41:51.281 --> 00:41:53.521
You know it's not always possible

00:41:53.521 --> 00:41:55.041
to drop everything and go out.

00:41:56.521 --> 00:41:58.641
I think that women want
more out of life now,

00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:00.601
that is basically why they won't put up

00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:03.521
with a less than happy marriage.

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:06.561
- Are you ready
for a long term relationship?

00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:09.721
- I don't think you're ever ready

00:42:09.721 --> 00:42:11.801
for a long term relationship
either it happens to you

00:42:11.801 --> 00:42:13.961
or it doesn't really.

00:42:13.961 --> 00:42:16.281
I certainly wouldn't kick one

00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:21.281
in the teeth if it crept
up on me, yeah, why not?

00:42:22.121 --> 00:42:23.241
- Did you meet enough men

00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:25.641
before you decided who to marry?

00:42:25.641 --> 00:42:28.801
- I've been married a year
and a couple of months.

00:42:30.361 --> 00:42:32.561
And you do think Christ what have I done?

00:42:34.801 --> 00:42:36.241
- See I still got my kids.

00:42:36.241 --> 00:42:37.761
- And I'm being honest about it.

00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:40.241
And Russ thinks the same.

00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:43.001
At times you think
Christ what have I done?

00:42:44.761 --> 00:42:46.961
- Lynn married Russ at 19,

00:42:46.961 --> 00:42:48.761
he works for the Post Office.

00:42:48.761 --> 00:42:51.001
They have two daughters, Sarah and Emma.

00:42:52.081 --> 00:42:56.521
- I'm very much geared to the
family unit, I mean us all.

00:42:57.601 --> 00:43:01.081
We do things together all the time.

00:43:02.561 --> 00:43:04.561
I mean there are times
when Russ and I obviously

00:43:04.561 --> 00:43:07.201
we like to leave it all behind

00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:09.841
and go out just the two of us.

00:43:09.841 --> 00:43:11.841
Now as the girls are
getting older we've actually

00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:13.241
started taking them with us.

00:43:14.561 --> 00:43:16.281
I'll say, oh we haven't done very much

00:43:16.281 --> 00:43:17.841
but when you look back we have.

00:43:19.081 --> 00:43:21.841
It might only just be playing
games or going swimming

00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:25.561
or going for a walk
we're doing it together.

00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:27.721
- If you think that getting married

00:43:27.721 --> 00:43:28.721
as far as we're concerned

00:43:28.721 --> 00:43:30.361
is a case of going to work, coming home,

00:43:30.361 --> 00:43:32.801
cook tea for hubby,
going to bed, getting up,

00:43:32.801 --> 00:43:35.041
going to work you're totally mistaken.

00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:38.321
- Jackie married
Mick when she was 19.

00:43:40.281 --> 00:43:42.081
- I'm not sure I would recommend it.

00:43:43.081 --> 00:43:47.561
I think if but again you're generalising,

00:43:47.561 --> 00:43:52.041
I would say on average
19 is probably too young.

00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:57.481
We decided ourselves, I mean
just between the two of us,

00:43:57.481 --> 00:44:01.881
we knew it wasn't going
any further we both knew

00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:04.201
I think at the end of the
day we would be happier

00:44:04.201 --> 00:44:05.641
leading our own lives.

00:44:05.641 --> 00:44:09.481
Whether that involved other
people, you know was to be seen.

00:44:09.481 --> 00:44:13.921
But no, you've got to bear
in mind we had no children

00:44:13.921 --> 00:44:17.281
to worry about so really the only people

00:44:17.281 --> 00:44:19.081
that were getting hurt by us was us.

00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:23.921
- If I could have 2 girls and 2 boys.

00:44:25.201 --> 00:44:26.961
- And what about you Jackie?

00:44:26.961 --> 00:44:30.041
- My mom, cause she got five girls she has

00:44:30.961 --> 00:44:32.641
seven years bad luck,

00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:35.041
that's why she's got five girls.

00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:38.401
I'd like to be able to
have a happy family,

00:44:39.441 --> 00:44:42.401
I mean I know it's not possible
to be happy all the time

00:44:42.401 --> 00:44:44.521
but as much of the time that was possible.

00:44:45.561 --> 00:44:48.961
Go through there, that's
the nursery, hah hah.

00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:50.001
- Got any plans?

00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:50.841
- Do me a favour?

00:44:50.841 --> 00:44:53.801
- At 21 Jackie
had moved into a new house.

00:44:53.801 --> 00:44:57.481
By the time she was 28 she had
decided not to have children.

00:44:57.481 --> 00:45:00.121
- Basically I would say
because I'm far too selfish

00:45:01.401 --> 00:45:04.841
and I enjoy doing what I want
when I want and how I want

00:45:04.841 --> 00:45:09.841
and certainly at the moment I
can't see any way around that.

00:45:12.561 --> 00:45:15.841
That's not to say that's
a forever decision.

00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:22.961
This one on, here we go, oh yeah, yes.

00:45:25.121 --> 00:45:27.401
I had a brief but very sweet relationship,

00:45:27.401 --> 00:45:29.081
the result of which was Charlie.

00:45:29.081 --> 00:45:31.241
Cor blimey, Charlie, you're
supposed to clean your teeth,

00:45:31.241 --> 00:45:32.321
not eating the brush.

00:45:32.321 --> 00:45:34.601
It's the best thing that
could've happened to me

00:45:34.601 --> 00:45:37.441
and I would never have believed I could've

00:45:37.441 --> 00:45:39.961
enjoyed a child as much as I enjoy him.

00:45:39.961 --> 00:45:43.161
I actually sat down and sort of thought

00:45:43.161 --> 00:45:47.561
about should I have him or not.

00:45:47.561 --> 00:45:51.161
I thought about what I was
going to do if I did have him.

00:45:51.161 --> 00:45:52.801
How I was going to keep him.

00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:57.001
But it comes back to the
same old story, the family.

00:46:02.241 --> 00:46:06.281
My fathers only comment to
me was it is your decision,

00:46:06.281 --> 00:46:08.961
you tell me what you want to do

00:46:08.961 --> 00:46:11.321
and then we'll take it from there.

00:46:11.321 --> 00:46:13.281
And they've totally rallied around me.

00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:16.721
Anybody that wanted to know
just got told I was pregnant

00:46:16.721 --> 00:46:18.961
I wasn't with the father, end of story.

00:46:20.281 --> 00:46:22.001
People that know me know the full story

00:46:22.001 --> 00:46:23.321
and that's all that matters to me.

00:46:23.321 --> 00:46:25.721
And Charlie will know when he gets older.

00:46:26.961 --> 00:46:29.441
- When I got married
the primary reason was

00:46:29.441 --> 00:46:32.041
because I wanted to have a child,

00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:33.921
the two to me went together.

00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:37.721
- Why did you have a child out

00:46:37.721 --> 00:46:39.321
of a marriage that wasn't working?

00:46:39.321 --> 00:46:42.481
- Because I wanted
to have more than one child

00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:44.961
and it was a thing about
being an only child myself.

00:46:44.961 --> 00:46:48.761
I was always jealous of other
children that had brothers

00:46:48.761 --> 00:46:51.561
and sisters when I was
growing up and I didn't want

00:46:51.561 --> 00:46:54.801
to have more than one child
with two different fathers.

00:46:54.801 --> 00:46:57.201
I think that brother and
sister should have the

00:46:57.201 --> 00:46:59.761
same mother and the same
father, that is my ideal.

00:47:02.641 --> 00:47:05.041
I would hate to think it
was tough on the kids.

00:47:06.761 --> 00:47:10.081
William used to say why isn't
daddy living here any more

00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:12.641
and I would say to him,
well you know how you

00:47:12.641 --> 00:47:17.081
and Katherine argue and
get on each others nerves,

00:47:17.081 --> 00:47:20.481
well that's how daddy
and I are we just find

00:47:20.481 --> 00:47:24.321
that we're happier if were
not living in the same house.

00:47:24.321 --> 00:47:26.481
- I'm going to work in Woolworths.

00:47:27.561 --> 00:47:30.961
- At 21 Lynn was
working in a mobile library

00:47:30.961 --> 00:47:32.801
in Tower Hamlets in East London.

00:47:34.401 --> 00:47:37.001
- I've not stamped yours, Sleeping Beauty.

00:47:38.161 --> 00:47:42.081
Teaching children the beauty of books

00:47:42.081 --> 00:47:45.441
and watching their faces as books unfold

00:47:45.441 --> 00:47:48.081
to them is just fantastic.

00:47:48.081 --> 00:47:49.601
To work with children
of that age you've got

00:47:49.601 --> 00:47:51.521
to love them and I love children.

00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:55.241
The last 10 years of
government have actually

00:47:57.281 --> 00:47:59.321
in my opinion brought this country

00:47:59.321 --> 00:48:01.401
much much further downhill.

00:48:02.721 --> 00:48:05.721
We have lost an awful lot of
our National Health Service,

00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:09.321
an awful lot of our education system.

00:48:09.321 --> 00:48:13.001
I'm actually on the
governing body of two schools

00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:15.881
and I want the best for those kids

00:48:19.081 --> 00:48:21.081
that the system can provide.

00:48:21.921 --> 00:48:22.841
And if the systems not good enough,

00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:24.921
then we better the system.

00:48:24.921 --> 00:48:26.601
What would you do if
you had lots of money,

00:48:26.601 --> 00:48:29.081
about two pounds?

00:48:30.081 --> 00:48:33.161
- I would buy myself a house a new house,

00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:37.321
you know, one that's all nice and comfy.

00:48:37.321 --> 00:48:39.121
- Do you get
depressed by money problems?

00:48:39.961 --> 00:48:41.961
- No, why, why should you?

00:48:43.201 --> 00:48:44.721
If you can manage on what you've got.

00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:45.561
- It's easy to get
depressed over money.

00:48:45.561 --> 00:48:48.721
- It's so easy to but why should you?

00:48:48.721 --> 00:48:51.401
- When we've reached the
18th day of the month

00:48:51.401 --> 00:48:52.881
and my mortgage is due on the 20th

00:48:52.881 --> 00:48:54.481
and there's nowhere near
enough money in there

00:48:54.481 --> 00:48:56.321
I get depressed about it obviously.

00:48:57.241 --> 00:48:58.041
What money?

00:48:59.241 --> 00:49:01.601
- It was hard first of
all when I gave up work

00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:06.601
from having a fairly high
salary to nothing was hard but

00:49:08.481 --> 00:49:11.081
you get used to whatever
your circumstances are,

00:49:12.001 --> 00:49:13.641
you live in them, you get used to them

00:49:13.641 --> 00:49:15.641
and you cope, everybody does.

00:49:16.961 --> 00:49:20.041
- Sue now works
part-time for a Building Society.

00:49:20.961 --> 00:49:22.361
- Everything's
changed for me cause I'm now

00:49:22.361 --> 00:49:26.681
supporting myself a lot
more than I was a year ago.

00:49:26.681 --> 00:49:27.521
- How did you feel

00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:29.361
about living off Social Security?

00:49:29.361 --> 00:49:31.161
- I hated it, really hated it.

00:49:31.161 --> 00:49:33.321
Perhaps it's old fashioned values, I mean,

00:49:33.321 --> 00:49:36.041
Mom and Dad have certainly
never been in that situation

00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:38.481
but then my mom and dad have
never been single parents

00:49:38.481 --> 00:49:41.401
either so you have to do what's

00:49:41.401 --> 00:49:43.361
best for you and the children.

00:49:43.361 --> 00:49:44.561
- Thanks very much.

00:49:44.561 --> 00:49:45.801
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:49:47.561 --> 00:49:50.001
- I took a year off when I had Charlie

00:49:50.001 --> 00:49:52.561
and the state kept me for that year

00:49:52.561 --> 00:49:55.081
but I went back to work and although

00:49:55.081 --> 00:49:58.241
to be honest at the time I
pay everything out I'm not

00:49:58.241 --> 00:50:00.201
that much better off but I feel better.

00:50:01.321 --> 00:50:03.881
You take it from there,
can I get through this week

00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:05.601
or can I get through this month?

00:50:05.601 --> 00:50:08.081
Can I get Charlie the things he needs?

00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:10.481
Somewhere along the line
you get the money you need

00:50:10.481 --> 00:50:15.321
for whatever you need and as
it goes at the moment we're

00:50:15.321 --> 00:50:18.321
working and were trying to keep
our families as best we can.

00:50:23.761 --> 00:50:26.121
♪If I said that I love you. ♪

00:50:26.121 --> 00:50:27.321
- Why is it that you three

00:50:27.321 --> 00:50:29.041
haven't changed so much do you think?

00:50:29.041 --> 00:50:31.721
- Perhaps we haven't grown up.

00:50:31.721 --> 00:50:34.081
- We've all had a stable background

00:50:34.081 --> 00:50:36.561
with stable relationships
all the way through.

00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:41.401
- The same people are there
now that were there then.

00:50:41.401 --> 00:50:42.681
- She initially went into hospital

00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:46.121
for an exploratory operation,
they found out she had

00:50:46.121 --> 00:50:50.081
cancer although at that stage
we didn't know how bad it was.

00:50:51.961 --> 00:50:56.521
She was ill at the time,
they started chemotherapy

00:50:57.601 --> 00:51:02.601
and radiation treatment
and she was just so bad.

00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:06.481
Mom badly wanted to
come back to the family

00:51:06.481 --> 00:51:08.241
and the family needed her here.

00:51:10.321 --> 00:51:13.761
She then spent nine months of hell

00:51:14.881 --> 00:51:16.721
I wouldn't have wished on anybody.

00:51:21.401 --> 00:51:26.401
- She sat down on the settee
and she died, just like that.

00:51:27.961 --> 00:51:30.681
And we were up in Norfolk
with my in-laws at the time.

00:51:31.881 --> 00:51:35.201
And so all we got was
a phone call from Dad

00:51:35.201 --> 00:51:38.521
to say that mom had died.

00:51:41.161 --> 00:51:42.761
- And how did you deal with it?

00:51:42.761 --> 00:51:44.361
- I'm still dealing with it now.

00:51:55.561 --> 00:51:58.241
But then although she's
not with us in body

00:51:58.241 --> 00:51:59.721
she's still with us in spirit.

00:52:04.841 --> 00:52:07.321
She was a great friend
to me as well as a mom,

00:52:07.321 --> 00:52:09.321
probably the best friend I'll ever have.

00:52:11.321 --> 00:52:12.561
And as you see it still makes me

00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:15.241
very emotional now, it's only 2 years.

00:52:17.281 --> 00:52:19.841
To some it's probably
seems oh it's a long time

00:52:21.401 --> 00:52:23.321
but it's not very long.

00:52:24.561 --> 00:52:26.881
- The poor, if you don't help them

00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:29.961
they probably die soon wouldn't they.

00:52:30.001 --> 00:52:30.801
- Some people are just born into

00:52:30.801 --> 00:52:32.401
rich families and they're lucky.

00:52:33.361 --> 00:52:34.921
- I don't see why they should
have the luck when people

00:52:34.921 --> 00:52:37.641
have worked all their lives
and haven't got half as much

00:52:37.641 --> 00:52:39.041
as what they have.

00:52:39.041 --> 00:52:40.481
It just don't seem fair.

00:52:40.481 --> 00:52:43.601
We only had a limited choice
any way, truth be told.

00:52:43.601 --> 00:52:46.601
We didn't have the choice of education

00:52:46.601 --> 00:52:48.801
because they couldn't have
afforded it anyway so we

00:52:48.801 --> 00:52:50.881
just went to the school we wanted to go to

00:52:50.881 --> 00:52:52.881
and we made the best of
it when we were there.

00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:55.841
That is something perhaps
when it comes to our children

00:52:55.841 --> 00:52:58.241
that we would say why not go further?

00:52:58.241 --> 00:53:01.241
- All I am interested in
and probably the same as

00:53:01.241 --> 00:53:03.921
the other two is what is good for me,

00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:06.761
what is good for my son and that's it.

00:53:08.761 --> 00:53:12.001
I don't sit there envying maybe
what Suzi could do for her

00:53:12.001 --> 00:53:13.521
children that I can't do for mine.

00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:17.881
Yes, I'd love the money to
be able to put him all round

00:53:17.881 --> 00:53:19.961
the world, I'd love to be able to do that

00:53:19.961 --> 00:53:21.081
but I haven't got it.

00:53:21.081 --> 00:53:24.321
And at the end of the day
I'm going to do what I can.

00:53:26.201 --> 00:53:28.081
At this precise moment
in time is probably one

00:53:28.081 --> 00:53:30.641
of the best times of my life.

00:53:30.641 --> 00:53:33.081
Come here, come and put your top on.

00:53:33.081 --> 00:53:35.401
I think probably because I've got Charlie,

00:53:35.401 --> 00:53:38.921
he's totally transformed
my life a lot of the times

00:53:38.921 --> 00:53:41.841
I obviously pull my hair out
but certainly for the better.

00:53:42.801 --> 00:53:44.961
So yes, I'm a lot happier within myself.

00:53:46.041 --> 00:53:47.961
People around me have noticed that.

00:53:47.961 --> 00:53:49.321
So it's a good time for me.

00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:52.001
Give us a cuddle.

00:53:52.001 --> 00:53:54.481
I don't really want Charlie to be an only,

00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:56.681
I'd love him to have brothers and sisters,

00:53:56.681 --> 00:53:58.161
but not necessarily loads of them,

00:53:58.161 --> 00:54:00.721
just one would do actually.

00:54:02.121 --> 00:54:03.601
I think Charlie would like that as well.

00:54:04.721 --> 00:54:05.841
I think Charlie would love it.

00:54:08.001 --> 00:54:10.761
- A year ago Lynn
started having black outs,

00:54:10.761 --> 00:54:12.721
she took medical advice.

00:54:12.721 --> 00:54:15.801
- They stuck all these tubes up inside me

00:54:15.801 --> 00:54:18.001
and discovered that I'd
got these veins here

00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:20.761
that shouldn't be there.

00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:22.521
- In your brain?

00:54:22.521 --> 00:54:23.361
- Mm-hmm.

00:54:24.241 --> 00:54:25.961
- And what can they do about it?

00:54:25.961 --> 00:54:27.561
- Not a lot at the moment.

00:54:27.561 --> 00:54:29.681
They're investigating other...

00:54:32.361 --> 00:54:34.801
treatments but the surgeon

00:54:34.961 --> 00:54:39.961
said that he doesn't want
to operate at the moment

00:54:39.961 --> 00:54:42.881
because the risk it's
too near the optic nerve

00:54:42.881 --> 00:54:45.521
and there's an 80% chance
of hitting the optic nerve.

00:54:47.281 --> 00:54:48.401
- So is it frightening to know

00:54:48.401 --> 00:54:49.881
that you have this condition?

00:54:49.881 --> 00:54:54.081
- It was for about
a week but it got itself

00:54:54.081 --> 00:54:58.961
into its own place within
my system where sort of

00:54:58.961 --> 00:55:02.481
amongst my rungs of priorities

00:55:03.441 --> 00:55:05.401
and I overcame the fear of it,

00:55:05.401 --> 00:55:06.961
now it doesn't worry me at all.

00:55:09.921 --> 00:55:12.201
- We've all got
little secret dreams.

00:55:12.201 --> 00:55:17.041
I mean I loved drama at
school, I loved to sing,

00:55:17.041 --> 00:55:18.401
along with millions of others,

00:55:18.401 --> 00:55:21.401
so I would like to have
carried that further.

00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:23.841
It was discussed at one
stage, you know going

00:55:23.841 --> 00:55:27.361
to drama school and
pursuing it but I really

00:55:27.361 --> 00:55:29.361
at the time didn't have the bottle.

00:55:29.361 --> 00:55:34.361
Didn't want to give up work
and income as a young person.

00:55:34.881 --> 00:55:37.481
I was quite enjoying myself.

00:55:37.481 --> 00:55:40.921
Didn't want to risk all
that to follow the dream.

00:55:44.081 --> 00:55:45.961
- So are these good times Sue?

00:55:45.961 --> 00:55:48.241
- Not particularly no.

00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:50.561
I've got two lovely children now

00:55:50.561 --> 00:55:51.561
but it's just another
crossroads for me now.

00:55:51.561 --> 00:55:52.681
I don't know which way I'm going to go,

00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:53.801
whats going to happen.

00:55:54.801 --> 00:55:57.721
I'm on my own basically,
I'm starting again.

00:55:59.401 --> 00:56:00.281
- Are you changing?

00:56:00.281 --> 00:56:01.801
- I'm just growing up.

00:56:02.681 --> 00:56:05.041
I don't think you ever stop
growing up the circumstances

00:56:05.041 --> 00:56:07.721
are changing so I'm just adapting.

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:15.641
- When I grow up I'd like to find out all

00:56:15.641 --> 00:56:18.321
about the moon and all that.

00:56:18.321 --> 00:56:21.401
- At 7 Nick
a farmers son was at a

00:56:21.401 --> 00:56:24.081
one room village school
in the Yorkshire Dales.

00:56:26.241 --> 00:56:28.441
- I said I was interested in
physics and chemistry well

00:56:28.441 --> 00:56:29.881
I'm not going to do that here.

00:56:29.881 --> 00:56:31.801
- At 14 he
was going to a Yorkshire

00:56:31.801 --> 00:56:35.961
boarding school and at 21 was
reading physics at Oxford.

00:56:35.961 --> 00:56:38.121
So what career are you going to pursue?

00:56:38.121 --> 00:56:40.281
- It depends whether
I'll be good enough to do

00:56:40.281 --> 00:56:41.841
what I really want to do.

00:56:43.241 --> 00:56:47.721
I would like if I can to do research.

00:56:47.721 --> 00:56:50.481
The gap in these
experiments is a temperature

00:56:50.481 --> 00:56:52.121
comparable with that of the sun whereas

00:56:52.121 --> 00:56:54.361
in a power reactor it
would be maybe 10 times

00:56:54.361 --> 00:56:55.681
the temperature of the sun.

00:56:55.681 --> 00:56:58.241
- At 28 he had moved to America

00:56:58.241 --> 00:56:59.681
and was doing nuclear research

00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:01.441
at the University of Wisconsin.

00:57:01.441 --> 00:57:02.721
So how's it going Rich,

00:57:02.721 --> 00:57:04.321
tell me about the current drive.

00:57:06.841 --> 00:57:08.961
Ok so your all looking
at this thing expectantly

00:57:08.961 --> 00:57:11.161
so maybe I'd better
say something about it.

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:14.401
The first one is basically
saying that the rate of change

00:57:14.401 --> 00:57:18.241
of crystal momentum, it's
DDT at this quantity H bar K.

00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:22.001
That is equal to Laurent's Force.

00:57:22.001 --> 00:57:23.001
- He is now an associate

00:57:23.001 --> 00:57:24.641
professor at the University.

00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:28.241
Is Madison a friendly place?

00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:29.641
- Yes very friendly.

00:57:29.641 --> 00:57:33.321
It's a fairly small little
community and you get deer

00:57:33.321 --> 00:57:35.841
and things running through
here so it's kinda nice.

00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:39.241
You know you notice if
you walk into a shop here

00:57:39.241 --> 00:57:40.881
or a store as they would call it,

00:57:40.881 --> 00:57:43.841
people are much more polite to
you than they are in England.

00:57:43.841 --> 00:57:46.641
And it's not in a it's not just a matter

00:57:46.641 --> 00:57:49.721
of being obsequious, they just try

00:57:49.721 --> 00:57:52.001
and be reasonably
friendly and smile at you.

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:53.601
- Do you have a girlfriend?

00:57:57.801 --> 00:58:00.561
- I don't want to answer that,

00:58:00.561 --> 00:58:04.801
I don't answer those kind of questions.

00:58:06.641 --> 00:58:09.041
I thought that one would
come up because when I was,

00:58:09.921 --> 00:58:11.921
when I was doing the
other one somebody said

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:13.321
what do you think about girls

00:58:13.321 --> 00:58:15.001
and I said I don't answer
questions like that.

00:58:15.001 --> 00:58:16.801
Is that the reason you're asking it?

00:58:17.801 --> 00:58:19.321
Yeah I thought so.

00:58:22.801 --> 00:58:24.401
The best answer would be to say

00:58:24.401 --> 00:58:26.361
that I don't answer questions like that

00:58:28.001 --> 00:58:30.281
but you know it's what
I said when I was seven

00:58:30.281 --> 00:58:31.201
and it's still the most sensible

00:58:31.201 --> 00:58:34.081
but I mean, what about them.

00:58:34.081 --> 00:58:36.801
- Nick was only 17 when I first met him

00:58:36.801 --> 00:58:39.641
and I knew he was a nice person.

00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:44.641
I find him very attractive
and he used his intelligence

00:58:45.441 --> 00:58:48.361
in his relationship with
me which is very important.

00:58:48.361 --> 00:58:53.361
- She felt that she wasn't
portrayed at all like she is

00:58:53.881 --> 00:58:57.001
and that she felt foolish
as a result of it all.

00:58:57.881 --> 00:59:01.281
She was really taken by
surprise by how she came over

00:59:01.281 --> 00:59:06.281
and she really wasn't sure
why she came over that way

00:59:06.921 --> 00:59:10.561
but she was very unhappy
with everybody involved

00:59:10.561 --> 00:59:14.721
and so didn't want to be
in that position again.

00:59:14.721 --> 00:59:15.881
- Is she difficult?

00:59:15.881 --> 00:59:17.561
- At times yes.

00:59:17.561 --> 00:59:19.521
Whenever we have an argument
she does have a tendency

00:59:19.521 --> 00:59:23.601
to explode I suppose to get,
no to get really miserable.

00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:29.561
- We've only been married 4
years, anything could happen,

00:59:29.561 --> 00:59:30.841
we could easily drift apart,

00:59:30.841 --> 00:59:34.361
there are so many pressures
on people you just.

00:59:34.361 --> 00:59:35.721
- People saw the last film

00:59:35.721 --> 00:59:38.201
and thought this marriage
isn't going to work,

00:59:38.201 --> 00:59:39.841
this marriage isn't going to last,

00:59:39.841 --> 00:59:42.081
did you get that response?

00:59:42.081 --> 00:59:44.561
- Well, it's actually such a mystery to me

00:59:44.561 --> 00:59:46.401
what they thought they were talking about

00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:48.881
that I really just don't
relate to it at all.

00:59:48.881 --> 00:59:50.961
I have no, I just don't
why they said that,

00:59:50.961 --> 00:59:55.961
I mean the sorts of things
you were seeing was us trying

00:59:56.641 --> 00:59:59.441
to be very honest about it.

00:59:59.441 --> 01:00:01.561
That may have been the place

01:00:01.561 --> 01:00:04.601
in 28 where we probably
were working hardest

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.201
about really describing what
things were like instead of

01:00:07.201 --> 01:00:11.281
I was just saying I
sometimes just am very dull

01:00:11.281 --> 01:00:14.401
and neutral and show too much of myself.

01:00:14.401 --> 01:00:16.641
Well in that I think we were
just trying to be really

01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:19.721
upfront and say this is what
it's like and we're working

01:00:19.721 --> 01:00:22.441
very hard at it and
hopefully it'll work out.

01:00:23.521 --> 01:00:27.721
If that sounds to somebody
like it's in jeopardy

01:00:27.721 --> 01:00:30.801
well that's their problem.

01:00:32.121 --> 01:00:34.121
- The big issue
for us at the moment

01:00:34.121 --> 01:00:39.121
is how were going to manage to
have kids and run 2 careers.

01:00:39.441 --> 01:00:40.641
- In those early formative years

01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:41.481
would you be happy

01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:44.041
for your children to
be brought up by Jackie

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:46.921
and Jackie not to be able to
give them the full attention?

01:00:46.921 --> 01:00:48.441
- Well it's not I mean that's putting it

01:00:48.441 --> 01:00:49.841
in a rather strange way,
- That's him, he's bringing

01:00:49.841 --> 01:00:50.721
them up too you know.
- I mean this is an area,

01:00:50.721 --> 01:00:52.321
- It's not just me.

01:00:53.241 --> 01:00:55.881
- I pay lip service to the
idea of equal shares on this

01:00:55.881 --> 01:00:57.401
and it remains to be seen whether I would

01:00:57.401 --> 01:00:59.161
actually live up to my intentions.

01:00:59.161 --> 01:01:00.721
- There are several things
I think to be said here,

01:01:00.721 --> 01:01:03.521
I don't want to be the
person to be left behind

01:01:03.521 --> 01:01:06.881
while Nick flies in and
shares an adult life

01:01:06.881 --> 01:01:09.441
with his children at college and working.

01:01:09.441 --> 01:01:11.441
I want to be there too.

01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:16.081
- Nick and Jackie
now have a 1 year old son Adam.

01:01:16.081 --> 01:01:20.401
- On the subject of
Adam, I enjoy doing this

01:01:20.401 --> 01:01:22.761
for the most part but I don't
want the sins of the father

01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:25.881
to be visited on the son in
this case so we've sort of

01:01:25.881 --> 01:01:28.841
decided that we want
to keep him out of this

01:01:28.841 --> 01:01:31.001
to some extent, well to some extent

01:01:31.001 --> 01:01:33.121
essentially all together.

01:01:33.121 --> 01:01:36.961
When I grow up I'd like to find out all

01:01:36.961 --> 01:01:39.641
about the moon and all that.

01:01:39.641 --> 01:01:41.961
- Where did you
get all this brain power?

01:01:42.921 --> 01:01:45.801
- All this brain power, I don't know.

01:01:45.801 --> 01:01:48.041
This is one that we were quite proud of,

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:50.881
glow discharges between
a couple of metal plates

01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:53.121
where there's an ionised gas in between.

01:01:53.121 --> 01:01:55.721
I suppose I'm very
ambitious in terms of trying

01:01:55.721 --> 01:01:59.001
to get my research to go forward.

01:01:59.001 --> 01:02:02.121
I'm also trying to train students so that

01:02:02.121 --> 01:02:04.201
they can actually acquire
some useful skills

01:02:04.201 --> 01:02:07.001
and can go out and just be
really useful contributors

01:02:07.001 --> 01:02:09.841
themselves and push back the frontiers of

01:02:09.841 --> 01:02:11.321
what we're capable of doing.

01:02:12.401 --> 01:02:15.161
They'd like to come out for a holiday

01:02:15.161 --> 01:02:17.241
in the country when we'd like,

01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:19.841
when I'd like to have
a holiday in the town.

01:02:20.841 --> 01:02:22.521
I've been to Leeds a couple of times

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:25.841
and haven't been to Manchester.

01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:33.241
I went to London with the other programme,

01:02:34.641 --> 01:02:35.601
when you did the first programme,

01:02:35.601 --> 01:02:37.881
but that's the only time I've been.

01:02:37.881 --> 01:02:42.281
In my position I don't feel
that I'm letting England

01:02:42.281 --> 01:02:44.761
down because I don't think
that England particularly

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.841
wanted me there doing what I was doing.

01:02:47.841 --> 01:02:49.561
So how can I feel that
I'm betraying a country

01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:52.841
when it doesn't want me to do
what it's trained me to do?

01:02:54.321 --> 01:02:55.241
- Do you get lonely here?

01:02:56.241 --> 01:02:59.161
- You just tend to get stuck
into your everyday routine

01:02:59.161 --> 01:03:02.881
and you don't think about
it but when you call home

01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:07.641
then you realise how far
away you are and now it seems

01:03:07.641 --> 01:03:09.841
acute because both our families are

01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:12.881
getting older even if you think in terms

01:03:12.881 --> 01:03:16.401
of seeing them once every two years.

01:03:17.241 --> 01:03:18.081
- That's not so many times.

01:03:18.081 --> 01:03:20.201
- You're thinking only about 10 times

01:03:20.201 --> 01:03:22.761
and that's awful when
you think in those terms

01:03:22.761 --> 01:03:25.401
you realise you really are in exile.

01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:28.641
- Do you miss England?

01:03:28.641 --> 01:03:29.961
- An awful lot yeah.

01:03:31.281 --> 01:03:34.281
My parents managed to get
over here a couple of times

01:03:34.281 --> 01:03:36.761
in the last two years and
Andrew my middle brother

01:03:36.761 --> 01:03:39.161
was here about two years ago so that's

01:03:39.161 --> 01:03:41.601
pretty good going in way
that they got over here.

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:47.681
Christopher is the brother
who is deaf as you know

01:03:47.681 --> 01:03:50.001
and his language skills are getting better

01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:52.601
but be certainly didn't get a flying start

01:03:52.601 --> 01:03:55.081
from the education system
that he went through

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:58.241
so you know he really is
still getting to the point

01:03:58.241 --> 01:04:02.441
where you know, he can't hear essentially

01:04:02.441 --> 01:04:04.041
at all so you can't
really have a conversation

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:04.881
with him on the phone.

01:04:04.881 --> 01:04:06.801
He'll get on the phone and tell you

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:08.481
a bunch of stuff and you can understand

01:04:08.481 --> 01:04:10.921
most of it so that's really nice.

01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:13.361
- Is it painful for you?

01:04:13.361 --> 01:04:16.721
- Well the thing that was
emotional to think back on

01:04:16.721 --> 01:04:19.801
was the situation when he
was probably a year old

01:04:19.801 --> 01:04:22.001
and it was really becoming
clear to everybody

01:04:22.001 --> 01:04:25.561
that despite the fact that his doctor

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:28.401
has originally insisted no he wasn't deaf

01:04:28.401 --> 01:04:30.841
that it became pretty clear that he was.

01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:34.561
And you know at the time
I just desperately was

01:04:34.561 --> 01:04:38.921
hoping it wouldn't be
true, that somehow some

01:04:38.921 --> 01:04:41.241
sort of miracle would
happen and he would turn out

01:04:41.241 --> 01:04:46.001
not to be, so but then I told
myself well if he weren't then

01:04:46.001 --> 01:04:47.961
he wouldn't be the same
person and it would be wishing

01:04:47.961 --> 01:04:49.841
that the person didn't exist so

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:54.081
that wasn't the appropriate
way to think about it.

01:04:59.041 --> 01:05:01.761
- Do you think
you can build a life here?

01:05:03.241 --> 01:05:05.121
- Well you know, one is trying to

01:05:05.121 --> 01:05:07.881
but it is very difficult
being in a place where

01:05:07.881 --> 01:05:11.641
you're a long way away
from all your background

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.641
and you don't have any
sort of support network.

01:05:13.641 --> 01:05:17.721
It really does, I mean you
have to fend for yourself,

01:05:17.721 --> 01:05:20.401
you keep thinking for yourself,

01:05:20.401 --> 01:05:21.841
you're really being called on

01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:24.961
to show pioneer spirit every
now and again it seems.

01:05:27.801 --> 01:05:28.641
It don't have this urge that you

01:05:28.641 --> 01:05:31.001
sometimes hear people
saying that I want my child

01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:32.161
to have all the things that I didn't.

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:35.081
I don't look back and
think I was deprived.

01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:38.601
There were things that
I had in a certain sense

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.841
as a child which were not material things

01:05:40.841 --> 01:05:45.561
that I had but situations
I was in and experiences

01:05:45.561 --> 01:05:48.281
that most children
wouldn't have growing up

01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:50.881
on a farm and actually working on a farm

01:05:50.881 --> 01:05:53.081
and being in a situation of being told,

01:05:53.081 --> 01:05:56.161
clean out that calf
shed really has made me

01:05:56.161 --> 01:05:58.561
very determined to get things done

01:05:58.561 --> 01:06:01.201
and not give up half
way through something.

01:06:01.201 --> 01:06:04.961
It develops a streak of
stubbornness that can be useful now.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.281
The trouble with me is that
I tend to take the streak of

01:06:07.281 --> 01:06:12.281
stubbornness too far I have
to try and mellow out a bit.

01:06:15.361 --> 01:06:16.401
- Have you
travelled a long way since

01:06:16.401 --> 01:06:19.761
that seven year old in
his big muddy boots?

01:06:19.761 --> 01:06:22.241
- I suppose an awful long way yes.

01:06:22.241 --> 01:06:25.361
I mean I'm sure there's
lot of the same personality

01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:27.641
that was in there is still here.

01:06:27.641 --> 01:06:29.801
Still easily embarrassed and confused.

01:06:30.601 --> 01:06:34.481
I mean I think that you
can see the saying give

01:06:34.481 --> 01:06:38.881
the boy until he is seven,
I'm quite prepared to accept

01:06:38.881 --> 01:06:40.881
there's a lot in that.

01:06:40.881 --> 01:06:44.961
If you could look at me at
seven and see through the

01:06:44.961 --> 01:06:46.801
sort of superficial things
and the silly things

01:06:46.801 --> 01:06:49.921
I was saying you could see
what made the child tick,

01:06:49.921 --> 01:06:51.401
there was probably an awful lot in

01:06:51.401 --> 01:06:52.721
there that's here now yes.

01:06:58.441 --> 01:07:01.521
- I read the Financial Times.

01:07:01.521 --> 01:07:04.201
- I read the Observer and the Times.

01:07:04.201 --> 01:07:06.761
- What do you like about it?

01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:09.641
- Well I like, I usually
look at the headlines

01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:14.001
and then read about them, about it.

01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:17.161
- What's the point of the programme?

01:07:18.361 --> 01:07:20.841
- The point of the programme
is to reach a comparison.

01:07:20.841 --> 01:07:21.841
I don't think it is.

01:07:23.641 --> 01:07:25.441
We're not necessarily typical examples.

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:26.961
- And I think that's what people seeing

01:07:26.961 --> 01:07:29.401
the programme might think, falsely.

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:33.121
- Yes, they tend to typecast us.

01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:37.361
- So everything we say they'll think oh

01:07:37.361 --> 01:07:40.321
that's a typical result of
the public school system.

01:07:42.081 --> 01:07:43.881
- It's certainly true
that more people know

01:07:43.881 --> 01:07:46.081
they have more options
or imagine they have.

01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:50.801
I think in practical terms the difference

01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:55.481
in numerical number of
options isn't that great.

01:07:55.481 --> 01:07:58.081
- But the mere knowledge
creates an option in itself

01:07:58.081 --> 01:07:59.961
so I think we do have more options

01:07:59.961 --> 01:08:04.681
and it is undesirable but it's
very difficult to correct.

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:07.081
- I don't think it is
undesirable at all I think

01:08:07.081 --> 01:08:09.561
whats undesirable is
people who have had options

01:08:09.561 --> 01:08:12.481
don't take best advantage of them.

01:08:12.481 --> 01:08:17.481
When I leave this school
I'm going to Collet Court

01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:23.001
and then I will be going to
Westminster Boarding school

01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:24.241
if I pass the exam.

01:08:26.401 --> 01:08:30.201
And then we think I'm going
to Cambridge in Trinity Hall.

01:08:32.401 --> 01:08:34.561
- John went
to Westminster School

01:08:34.561 --> 01:08:37.521
and read Law at Christchurch Oxford.

01:08:37.521 --> 01:08:39.761
- I do believe parents
have a right to educate

01:08:39.761 --> 01:08:41.801
their children as they think fit.

01:08:41.801 --> 01:08:44.561
And I think someone who works

01:08:44.561 --> 01:08:46.921
on the assembly line in
some of these car factories

01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:49.281
earning huge wage could
well afford to send

01:08:49.281 --> 01:08:51.961
their children to private
schools if they wanted to.

01:08:53.481 --> 01:08:56.441
- At 21 we asked him
what career he would pursue.

01:08:57.481 --> 01:08:58.561
- Might be at the Bar.

01:09:00.641 --> 01:09:01.801
- Doing what?

01:09:03.001 --> 01:09:04.681
Perhaps Chancery practise?

01:09:04.681 --> 01:09:06.921
I now have a career, I'm a barrister,

01:09:08.681 --> 01:09:11.601
other than that life chugs
along in varying degrees.

01:09:12.601 --> 01:09:14.321
- John entered
the Chancery division

01:09:14.321 --> 01:09:17.681
of the High Court and
specialises in company law.

01:09:17.681 --> 01:09:20.921
- How wonderful, have you told Alexandra.

01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:23.401
- When I leave school I'm going to

01:09:23.401 --> 01:09:27.961
The Dragons School I might and mummy's

01:09:27.961 --> 01:09:31.761
and I might go to after I
might go to Charterhouse,

01:09:31.761 --> 01:09:36.641
Marlborough and I can't
remember the other places

01:09:41.601 --> 01:09:45.161
because mummy's got so many
but there's some of them.

01:09:45.161 --> 01:09:46.841
- What about university Charles?

01:09:46.841 --> 01:09:48.601
- I might go to Oxford.

01:09:49.721 --> 01:09:51.281
- Charles went to Marlborough

01:09:51.281 --> 01:09:53.081
but he didn't go to Oxford.

01:09:53.081 --> 01:09:55.241
Instead he went to Durham University.

01:09:56.481 --> 01:10:00.601
- I'm pleased I didn't
because it's very much

01:10:00.601 --> 01:10:04.121
a sort of set from Marlborough.

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:10.161
Prep school, Marlborough,
Oxbridge conveyor belt.

01:10:11.561 --> 01:10:13.041
Shoved out at the end.

01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:16.121
- And what
did Charles want to do?

01:10:16.121 --> 01:10:21.121
- Hard to say, probably
scribbling away in some basement

01:10:21.401 --> 01:10:24.321
for some London newspaper or something.

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:26.361
- Charles did
scribble away for an

01:10:26.361 --> 01:10:30.001
East London newspaper and
then moved onto the BBC

01:10:30.001 --> 01:10:32.001
where he is now a producer.

01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:33.881
He married last year.

01:10:33.881 --> 01:10:36.041
He prefers not to be on television.

01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:38.681
- I'm going to Charterhouse

01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:44.801
and after that Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

01:10:46.321 --> 01:10:47.721
- Andrew went to Charterhouse

01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:49.921
and Cambridge where he read Law.

01:10:51.161 --> 01:10:55.121
- I'd like to be a solicitor
and also fairly successful.

01:10:56.241 --> 01:10:58.361
- At 28 Andrew was a solicitor

01:10:58.361 --> 01:10:59.721
in a large London firm.

01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:02.441
What qualities do you think
it needs to be successful?

01:11:03.881 --> 01:11:06.601
- Well you have to have a
legal ability in my business

01:11:06.601 --> 01:11:09.561
obviously and you have to
have a sort of bedside manner

01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:11.841
as far as your clients are concerned.

01:11:11.841 --> 01:11:14.481
It's no good being brilliant if you can't

01:11:14.481 --> 01:11:16.921
communicate with your clients.

01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:19.841
- At 35 he had become a partner

01:11:19.841 --> 01:11:21.681
in the same company.

01:11:21.681 --> 01:11:24.601
- Well I work in the corporate
department of a large firm

01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:27.601
of solicitors in the city
that is dealing with things

01:11:27.601 --> 01:11:30.881
like mergers and
acquisitions, joint ventures,

01:11:30.881 --> 01:11:32.561
general corporate advice,

01:11:32.561 --> 01:11:35.721
putting deals together for clients.

01:11:35.721 --> 01:11:36.561
- What do you think

01:11:36.561 --> 01:11:37.841
about girl friends at your age?

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:42.321
- I've got one but I
don't think much of her.

01:11:42.321 --> 01:11:45.841
- I don't think I financially
come from the same background,

01:11:45.841 --> 01:11:48.641
Andrew didn't go for a haughty deb,

01:11:48.641 --> 01:11:50.881
he went for a good Yorkshire lass

01:11:50.881 --> 01:11:53.641
but I mean obviously
he knew what he wanted.

01:11:53.641 --> 01:11:56.161
- At 28 Andrew had married Jane.

01:11:57.081 --> 01:11:58.481
- I suppose the most important
thing that's happened is

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:01.921
that we've had two children
one five years ago,

01:12:01.921 --> 01:12:04.681
Alexandra and then a couple
of years later Timothy.

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:09.361
We've also moved out from
central London over to Wimbledon.

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.081
We decided we should
look somewhere there was

01:12:12.081 --> 01:12:14.561
a bit of green space so we moved out here.

01:12:15.881 --> 01:12:17.721
- What was the biggest surprise

01:12:17.721 --> 01:12:18.841
about having children?

01:12:21.161 --> 01:12:22.641
- That our ideas of
bringing them up may be not

01:12:22.641 --> 01:12:25.161
necessarily coincide with each others.

01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:29.721
- When I see the
children playing together now

01:12:29.721 --> 01:12:32.401
I realise how much fun they have together

01:12:32.401 --> 01:12:35.681
and it's probably what I
missed being an only child.

01:12:35.681 --> 01:12:37.641
- When boys go around
with girls they don't

01:12:37.641 --> 01:12:40.241
pay attention to what they're doing.

01:12:40.241 --> 01:12:43.241
Yes my grandmother had an accident because

01:12:43.241 --> 01:12:46.601
a boyfriend was kissing his
girlfriend in the street.

01:12:48.201 --> 01:12:51.161
The most important thing is
that I've gotten married.

01:12:51.161 --> 01:12:52.961
- He married
Claire, the daughter

01:12:52.961 --> 01:12:55.121
of a former Ambassador to Bulgaria.

01:12:56.321 --> 01:13:00.481
- Recently I think this
charity Friends of Bulgaria

01:13:00.481 --> 01:13:02.761
is something that's very
important in my life.

01:13:04.641 --> 01:13:09.041
I became involved in all this
to channel aid to Bulgaria.

01:13:10.641 --> 01:13:11.961
It is a great pleasure
to welcome you all here

01:13:11.961 --> 01:13:14.681
tonight on behalf of Friends of Bulgaria.

01:13:14.681 --> 01:13:17.361
My mother in fact is from Bulgaria,

01:13:17.361 --> 01:13:19.801
and that explains why for me Bulgaria

01:13:19.801 --> 01:13:21.041
is an especially important place.

01:13:23.761 --> 01:13:27.241
We decided for our inaugural
event it would be a good idea

01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:32.241
to have a concert and as
I'm a barrister I'd hoped

01:13:33.321 --> 01:13:37.561
I'd be able to get access
to one of the halls

01:13:37.561 --> 01:13:38.401
of the Inns of Court because

01:13:38.401 --> 01:13:40.561
they are very magnificent buildings.

01:13:41.961 --> 01:13:45.881
- It is coincidental that
we met but its obvious

01:13:45.881 --> 01:13:50.721
that the Balkan connection
was a strong mutual interest.

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:54.841
- I think it's not a bad
idea to pay for schools

01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:59.081
because if we didn't schools
would be so nasty and crowded.

01:14:00.241 --> 01:14:02.321
- So do I think so.

01:14:02.321 --> 01:14:04.961
And the people in the schools wouldn't.

01:14:04.961 --> 01:14:07.601
- And the poor people
would coming rushing in.

01:14:07.601 --> 01:14:12.281
- And the man in charge of the
school would get very angry

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.481
because he wouldn't be able to

01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:15.481
- And he'd get bankrupt.

01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:20.401
- pay all the masters if
he didn't have any money.

01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:24.881
- At 7 the boys
are singing Waltzing Matilda

01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:28.281
in Latin at their exclusive
private school in London.

01:14:30.961 --> 01:14:33.161
- An education is very important,

01:14:34.561 --> 01:14:37.881
I mean you can never be sure
of leaving your children

01:14:37.881 --> 01:14:40.481
any worldly goods but
at least you can be sure

01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:42.961
that once you're given
them a good education

01:14:42.961 --> 01:14:45.121
that's something that
no one can take away.

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:48.561
The important issue is
drawing the distinction

01:14:48.561 --> 01:14:52.041
between allowing people to
spend the money they earn,

01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:55.001
in other words low taxes,
and also putting enough money

01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:57.281
into the infrastructure,
things like education,

01:14:57.281 --> 01:14:59.481
health service, transport system.

01:15:00.521 --> 01:15:02.401
And that's a very
difficult balance to draw

01:15:02.401 --> 01:15:03.561
and I'm not sure that were doing

01:15:03.561 --> 01:15:04.401
the right thing at the moment.

01:15:04.401 --> 01:15:07.041
I think more should be being put into that

01:15:08.121 --> 01:15:10.601
and I think people would be
prepared to pay higher taxes

01:15:10.601 --> 01:15:12.641
to pay for that sort of thing.

01:15:16.441 --> 01:15:18.721
- Yeah just a bit late there.

01:15:18.721 --> 01:15:21.921
- All this talk about
opportunities, something I did

01:15:21.921 --> 01:15:24.641
slightly object to in the programme,

01:15:24.641 --> 01:15:27.081
we were all shown at the
age of seven outlining

01:15:27.081 --> 01:15:30.241
the academic sort of
career that most of us did

01:15:30.241 --> 01:15:33.321
in fact pursue but it didn't
show the sleepless nights,

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:35.081
the sort of pouring over our books.

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:38.081
All the sweat and toil

01:15:38.081 --> 01:15:40.241
that got us to University.

01:15:40.241 --> 01:15:42.521
It was presented as if it were part

01:15:42.521 --> 01:15:44.721
of some indestructible birth right

01:15:44.721 --> 01:15:45.641
that we went to all these places

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.041
and I thought that was unfair.

01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:50.121
It didn't show having to do
beastly jobs in the holidays.

01:15:50.121 --> 01:15:53.081
If I had a son I would like to send him

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.601
to Westminster where I went.

01:15:56.561 --> 01:15:58.801
Where I suspect the public schools

01:15:58.801 --> 01:16:03.121
or the major public schools
win over the state schools is

01:16:03.121 --> 01:16:06.281
in the quality of the
staff that they attract.

01:16:06.281 --> 01:16:08.441
I mean certainly at my school the teachers

01:16:08.441 --> 01:16:11.401
were absolutely first
rate but on the other hand

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:14.321
we had very little in
the way of facilities

01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:16.921
and computers and language laboratories

01:16:16.921 --> 01:16:21.401
that are taken for granted
in many state schools.

01:16:21.401 --> 01:16:24.961
And I think when people
talk about more resources

01:16:24.961 --> 01:16:29.081
they often mean more money
being spent on these things

01:16:29.081 --> 01:16:32.241
which in a sense are
inessentials, and less money

01:16:32.241 --> 01:16:33.561
is being spent on what really matters

01:16:33.561 --> 01:16:35.721
which is the quality of the teachers.

01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:37.641
- The rich children always make fun

01:16:37.641 --> 01:16:39.841
of poor children I think.

01:16:39.841 --> 01:16:42.441
- The acquisition of
sacks and sacks of money

01:16:42.441 --> 01:16:46.321
is not something that I
set much importance by.

01:16:47.321 --> 01:16:49.921
I'm not money minded I
would say in that sense.

01:16:49.921 --> 01:16:52.161
On the other hand it would be hypocritical

01:16:52.161 --> 01:16:55.201
to pretend that a lot of
the things that I take

01:16:55.201 --> 01:17:00.201
for granted and my lifestyle
is dependent on having

01:17:00.361 --> 01:17:03.081
a fair amount of money but I can't say

01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:06.081
that the acquisition of more money is one

01:17:06.081 --> 01:17:08.401
of my main aims in life.

01:17:08.401 --> 01:17:11.201
We now have a house in
the country which takes up

01:17:11.201 --> 01:17:14.801
a lot of our time and
energies and I seem to spend

01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:16.801
an awful lot of my time
gardening furiously,

01:17:16.801 --> 01:17:20.401
trying to tame the wilderness
that we inherited there.

01:17:20.401 --> 01:17:22.961
I'd have laughed if 10
years ago you'd have told me

01:17:22.961 --> 01:17:27.961
that I'd spend most of my time
digging herbaceous borders

01:17:28.281 --> 01:17:30.481
but that's what I seem
to do and I enjoy it.

01:17:32.161 --> 01:17:34.361
One good thing about
having quite a large house

01:17:34.361 --> 01:17:37.521
in the country now is that I've
taken up playing the piano.

01:17:38.641 --> 01:17:40.881
I've always had a piano
in London but with work

01:17:40.881 --> 01:17:43.561
I never had time to practise
and now we've got room

01:17:43.561 --> 01:17:46.561
to house a piano in the
country and I find I am now

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:50.601
practising quite a lot and
beginning to get it back a bit.

01:17:50.601 --> 01:17:52.201
- Certainly I can never
tell the difference

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:54.041
between you playing and the CD playing

01:17:54.041 --> 01:17:57.241
when I'm out of the
room, you're very good.

01:17:57.241 --> 01:17:58.721
- Well she's very diplomatic.

01:17:59.881 --> 01:18:02.321
- Does money concern you a lot?

01:18:03.241 --> 01:18:06.201
- I think as long as one
has enough to be comfortable

01:18:06.201 --> 01:18:09.361
that's really what one should aim for.

01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:14.801
We took the children skiing
for the first time last year,

01:18:14.801 --> 01:18:18.761
at least Alexander, and
he really enjoyed it.

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:21.361
- Is the family
unit the most important thing

01:18:21.361 --> 01:18:25.521
in your lives, more than
your own ambition or?

01:18:25.521 --> 01:18:28.241
- I'm not sure that I
have any ambition as such now

01:18:29.161 --> 01:18:32.321
I mean just to progress
with my work and so on.

01:18:32.321 --> 01:18:33.441
- I think ambition probably changes once

01:18:33.441 --> 01:18:36.521
you've got children, your
outlook on life is no longer

01:18:36.521 --> 01:18:38.401
the same as it was before.

01:18:38.401 --> 01:18:40.681
And you can still have
ambitions and the fact

01:18:40.681 --> 01:18:42.481
you want to be successful in your work

01:18:42.481 --> 01:18:44.561
but the end result is
that if you're successful

01:18:44.561 --> 01:18:46.601
in your work then you can enjoy

01:18:46.601 --> 01:18:48.961
your success with your children.

01:18:48.961 --> 01:18:50.841
And hopefully with your wife as well.

01:18:52.801 --> 01:18:56.721
- I think the more you have
out of the country the more

01:18:56.721 --> 01:19:00.041
privileges you're born with
the greater your duty is.

01:19:01.481 --> 01:19:04.281
I still feel as I did when
I was 21 that it's important

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:08.321
for people who have had advantages to try

01:19:08.321 --> 01:19:12.641
and put as much back and to
help others less fortunate

01:19:12.641 --> 01:19:15.441
than themselves if they can.

01:19:17.561 --> 01:19:20.961
In England as we all know
there is a perpetual debate

01:19:20.961 --> 01:19:23.961
about the National Health
Service being starved

01:19:23.961 --> 01:19:26.481
of resources but people who go on

01:19:26.481 --> 01:19:29.441
about the government butchering
the National Health Service

01:19:29.441 --> 01:19:31.001
I think should come over to Bulgaria

01:19:31.001 --> 01:19:35.201
to see what being kept
short of necessary supplies

01:19:35.201 --> 01:19:36.881
and funds really does mean.

01:19:37.961 --> 01:19:42.001
What were doing round
delivering drugs firstly

01:19:42.001 --> 01:19:45.081
that we've managed to purchase with monies

01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:49.361
so far raised by our appeal
and also at the same time,

01:19:49.361 --> 01:19:51.721
trying to find out what it
is that they really need

01:19:51.721 --> 01:19:54.241
so that we can be sure we're
getting the right things

01:19:54.241 --> 01:19:57.481
through to the right destinations.

01:19:57.481 --> 01:20:00.161
We've been told that in
some places its impossible

01:20:00.161 --> 01:20:02.921
to do even operations,
albeit that they have

01:20:02.921 --> 01:20:05.321
the operating theatres and
they have excellent doctors,

01:20:05.321 --> 01:20:07.201
for want of simple anaesthetics.

01:20:07.201 --> 01:20:10.321
In other places, for instance,

01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:12.841
the children's home at,
they're even lacking

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:15.441
such simple things as soap and detergent.

01:20:16.321 --> 01:20:19.001
These are things that
we can supply in England

01:20:19.001 --> 01:20:21.641
very painlessly and yet here they really

01:20:21.641 --> 01:20:23.561
make a lot of difference.

01:20:24.801 --> 01:20:28.241
- The Bulgaria that I
have known coming back

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:32.721
with John has been a
much more varied country

01:20:32.721 --> 01:20:37.001
and it has been very enriching to travel

01:20:37.001 --> 01:20:40.001
around the country with John and to have

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:44.401
the extra dimension of
John having investigated

01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:48.881
to a great degree his family tree down

01:20:48.881 --> 01:20:51.801
through many generations
and many centuries.

01:20:52.641 --> 01:20:55.401
- My great great grandfather who was the

01:20:55.401 --> 01:20:57.601
first prime minister of
Bulgaria when the country

01:20:57.601 --> 01:21:00.361
was liberated from the Turks in 1879.

01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:07.161
Well I think everyone
needs to have a feeling

01:21:07.161 --> 01:21:08.521
that they belong somewhere.

01:21:09.721 --> 01:21:10.641
There's a plot of land

01:21:10.641 --> 01:21:15.481
or somewhere they hail
from and their roots are.

01:21:18.161 --> 01:21:21.481
Within the last month a new
agricultural law has been

01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:25.641
passed returning land to
its former proprietors.

01:21:25.641 --> 01:21:28.521
We think that some part at
any rate of this property

01:21:28.521 --> 01:21:30.561
will become back to us and I for one

01:21:30.561 --> 01:21:33.321
am very excited at that prospect.

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:36.481
It belonged to my
grandfather, his brother.

01:21:38.001 --> 01:21:39.481
And they farmed it in the whole estate

01:21:39.481 --> 01:21:41.601
and partnership with my great grandfather.

01:21:42.921 --> 01:21:44.801
Looking at it with a professional eye,

01:21:44.801 --> 01:21:47.361
I've dealt with worse than
this in North Hampton.

01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:48.201
I don't think there's anything

01:21:48.201 --> 01:21:53.041
that couldn't be sorted
out given six months or so.

01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:56.081
And a couple house guests to stay.

01:21:57.881 --> 01:22:00.441
- Do you think you
and Claire could live here?

01:22:00.441 --> 01:22:02.161
- Ask me that in 7 years time.

01:22:03.921 --> 01:22:05.841
I don't think much of their accents.

01:22:05.841 --> 01:22:06.681
- Neither do I.

01:22:06.681 --> 01:22:07.521
- What's been
the effect of being

01:22:07.521 --> 01:22:09.001
in these films on you?

01:22:09.001 --> 01:22:11.401
- I don't think really there
has been any effect really.

01:22:11.401 --> 01:22:13.881
From time to time I meet
someone who I've never met

01:22:13.881 --> 01:22:15.801
before who says I think
I've seen you somewhere

01:22:15.801 --> 01:22:20.681
before haven't I and I say perhaps.

01:22:20.681 --> 01:22:22.361
I try not to talk about it.

01:22:23.601 --> 01:22:25.641
- You've got three minuses in a day.

01:22:28.161 --> 01:22:31.601
I must say I mainly laugh
when I see myself at seven.

01:22:32.761 --> 01:22:34.161
Obviously I said some shocking

01:22:34.161 --> 01:22:37.481
but extremely funny things in retrospect.

01:22:37.481 --> 01:22:39.681
It has to be said that I bitterly regret

01:22:39.681 --> 01:22:42.041
that the headmaster of
the school where I was

01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:45.001
when I was seven pushed
me forward for this series

01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:47.361
because every seven years

01:22:47.361 --> 01:22:50.041
a little pill of poison is injected.

01:22:51.641 --> 01:22:52.601
- Well no.

01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:57.081
- Well it's the truth, I dislike intensely

01:22:57.081 --> 01:23:00.481
being on television, I
refused to do this programme

01:23:00.481 --> 01:23:03.161
last time round and I'm
only doing it this time

01:23:03.161 --> 01:23:06.001
because I see this as an opportunity

01:23:06.001 --> 01:23:10.001
to draw the attention of
viewers in this country

01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:17.081
to the awful problems
in Bulgaria in the hope

01:23:17.241 --> 01:23:19.281
that they may wish to do something

01:23:19.281 --> 01:23:20.921
to help the situation there.

01:23:24.401 --> 01:23:29.321
- I don't like big boys hitting us

01:23:29.321 --> 01:23:33.001
and the prefects sending
us out for nothing.

01:23:36.001 --> 01:23:38.481
I know I prefer to be alone really.

01:23:38.481 --> 01:23:41.641
I find it hard to express
emotion most of the time

01:23:41.641 --> 01:23:44.841
although I'm getting on
top of that more now.

01:23:46.561 --> 01:23:48.961
Just the simple things
to say to sort of Susan,

01:23:48.961 --> 01:23:51.161
you know I love you something like that,

01:23:51.161 --> 01:23:52.921
I mean I can tell you about it

01:23:52.921 --> 01:23:55.561
but I really haven't been able to say it

01:23:55.561 --> 01:23:58.881
freely to Sue you know.

01:23:58.881 --> 01:24:00.521
- What was it
that you fell in love with,

01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:01.841
what is it about him?

01:24:01.841 --> 01:24:04.401
- His helplessness I suppose,

01:24:04.401 --> 01:24:06.001
it was the motherly instinct in me

01:24:06.001 --> 01:24:07.601
to pick him up and cuddle him.

01:24:08.601 --> 01:24:09.721
He's also very good looking I think

01:24:09.721 --> 01:24:11.401
but he doesn't agree with me.

01:24:12.601 --> 01:24:15.321
In the summer he's got this
cute little bum in shorts.

01:24:16.401 --> 01:24:18.481
I mean I can tell quite a few stories here

01:24:18.481 --> 01:24:20.881
but the one that really
irritates me the most is

01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:23.001
that when we have an argument
he says that's it, leave me.

01:24:23.001 --> 01:24:25.761
And I say fine, all right I will one day.

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:26.921
But that's it you know after all

01:24:26.921 --> 01:24:28.121
these years of marriage,
we've been married for

01:24:28.121 --> 01:24:30.361
what 13 years now or something

01:24:30.361 --> 01:24:32.401
and he still say you're leaving me.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:34.721
Well one day I might
just pack my bags and go.

01:24:37.081 --> 01:24:38.601
- At seven, Paul was at a

01:24:38.601 --> 01:24:40.201
children's home in London.

01:24:42.841 --> 01:24:45.801
Were you happy at the
children's home in England?

01:24:45.801 --> 01:24:47.921
- We didn't mind that
really cause we didn't know

01:24:47.921 --> 01:24:51.081
what was going on cause
we were a bit young.

01:24:51.081 --> 01:24:53.961
My mother and father got,
well they separated originally

01:24:53.961 --> 01:24:58.801
I think they eventually got divorced,

01:24:58.801 --> 01:25:00.321
I went to the Boarding school for one year

01:25:00.321 --> 01:25:02.321
and we emigrated to Australia.

01:25:03.961 --> 01:25:05.441
My father got remarried.

01:25:07.881 --> 01:25:09.721
- How do you get
on with your step mother?

01:25:10.601 --> 01:25:14.961
- Pretty well but like I said
before I'm just not close,

01:25:14.961 --> 01:25:17.001
I'm not really close to my father either.

01:25:21.681 --> 01:25:22.681
- Do you have
any regrets about the fact

01:25:22.681 --> 01:25:25.081
that you weren't closer to
him when you were younger?

01:25:25.081 --> 01:25:27.161
- Yes I suppose, I
mean it's all wasted time

01:25:27.161 --> 01:25:29.001
in a way I suppose.

01:25:29.001 --> 01:25:31.681
He was always there, I could always talk

01:25:31.681 --> 01:25:34.601
to him but it was different.

01:25:34.601 --> 01:25:36.081
- A lot of people that
go out to Australia,

01:25:36.081 --> 01:25:37.961
these English people,
they go out without family

01:25:37.961 --> 01:25:40.601
you know and all of a
sudden Paul's come here

01:25:40.601 --> 01:25:44.321
and he's got all this family
he sort of half knew existed.

01:25:46.921 --> 01:25:49.361
- So Paul brought
Sue and his two children

01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:52.641
Katy and Robert to visit the
family for the first time.

01:25:53.961 --> 01:25:57.281
Do you think about England
much when you're in Australia?

01:25:57.281 --> 01:25:59.401
- Only when the crickets on.

01:25:59.401 --> 01:26:00.281
- I mean I'm in awe of everything I see

01:26:00.281 --> 01:26:01.721
because I've always
wanted to come to London,

01:26:01.721 --> 01:26:04.721
I always thought it would
be great thing to do.

01:26:04.721 --> 01:26:06.561
And all of a sudden I'm here

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:09.281
and I'm having a great time
and Paul and the kids are just,

01:26:09.281 --> 01:26:12.641
I'm just dragging them along
behind like come on we're off.

01:26:12.641 --> 01:26:14.001
But no, it'd be really interesting

01:26:14.001 --> 01:26:15.241
because I'd had lots of family.

01:26:15.241 --> 01:26:18.761
And I know I love this sort
of stuff, bit of a showpony.

01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:26.281
- When the crunch came
and we were coming over here

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:27.561
I didn't want to do it.

01:26:27.561 --> 01:26:28.441
It's just something in me

01:26:28.441 --> 01:26:30.921
that holds me back I just it's shyness

01:26:30.921 --> 01:26:32.201
or something I'm not sure.

01:26:34.161 --> 01:26:36.841
I'm not really good at
meeting new people I guess.

01:26:38.561 --> 01:26:39.801
- Is there
any way you would want

01:26:39.801 --> 01:26:42.481
to be a father any
differently from the way

01:26:42.481 --> 01:26:43.841
your father was to you?

01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:48.081
- I'd like there to be more contact

01:26:48.081 --> 01:26:51.241
close actual physical contact close.

01:26:51.241 --> 01:26:53.961
My dad and I are exactly the same like

01:26:53.961 --> 01:26:58.401
that we you know if we hug it's unusual.

01:26:58.401 --> 01:27:00.921
- When we had Katy when
she was born Paul said

01:27:00.921 --> 01:27:02.601
to me oh I'm glad I've got a daughter.

01:27:02.601 --> 01:27:04.921
He said when I'm an old man at least

01:27:04.921 --> 01:27:05.761
she'll be able to come up

01:27:05.761 --> 01:27:07.601
and give me a kiss and a cuddle.

01:27:07.601 --> 01:27:09.321
- Would you
like to get married Paul?

01:27:10.241 --> 01:27:11.241
- No.

01:27:11.241 --> 01:27:12.601
- Tell me why not.

01:27:12.601 --> 01:27:16.681
- I don't want like them
say you had a wife they,

01:27:18.081 --> 01:27:22.161
they say you had to eat
what they cooked you

01:27:23.041 --> 01:27:27.201
and say I don't like greens, well I don't,

01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:32.201
and say she said you have
to eat what you give.

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:35.841
So, I don't like greens say she gives me

01:27:35.841 --> 01:27:37.241
greens and that's it.

01:27:39.281 --> 01:27:41.001
- Divorce was something new to me.

01:27:42.081 --> 01:27:43.041
I figured what Paul's been through,

01:27:43.041 --> 01:27:44.721
I mean Paul doesn't say it's very bad

01:27:44.721 --> 01:27:47.321
but I wouldn't like that for my children.

01:27:47.321 --> 01:27:49.281
- What keeps
this marriage together?

01:27:51.321 --> 01:27:54.641
- Learning to keep your mouth
closed at times, I don't know.

01:27:54.641 --> 01:27:57.801
- Tolerance I think, I mean we
don't stew we have arguments,

01:27:57.801 --> 01:27:59.561
big arguments like anyone else

01:27:59.561 --> 01:28:03.321
and we have spoken about this before.

01:28:03.321 --> 01:28:04.721
We don't tend to stew over it

01:28:04.721 --> 01:28:09.561
for any length of time, we
can be unbelievable together,

01:28:09.561 --> 01:28:12.041
you know biting each others heads off

01:28:12.041 --> 01:28:16.561
but we don't never go to the next day.

01:28:18.401 --> 01:28:20.041
- This is the one thing
that the shows done to us is

01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:22.561
that it makes you analyse
things a bit more you know

01:28:22.561 --> 01:28:23.601
like maybe if the show hadn't have

01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:26.041
been here we may have split up.

01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:30.201
You think well we can see what
we were like a long time ago

01:28:30.201 --> 01:28:33.081
and it brings it back
to you, you think well,

01:28:33.081 --> 01:28:37.201
we had this then, often a
lot of people grow apart

01:28:37.201 --> 01:28:39.801
and can't see what they had originally.

01:28:39.801 --> 01:28:41.841
- I don't think the show could
actually hold you together.

01:28:41.841 --> 01:28:43.841
- No, no but what it's showing you is

01:28:43.841 --> 01:28:45.201
what you had in the past.

01:28:49.801 --> 01:28:52.241
- In their twenties,
Paul and Sue sold up,

01:28:52.241 --> 01:28:55.641
bought an old van and
travelled through Australia.

01:28:55.641 --> 01:28:57.681
- I think it brought us closer together,

01:28:57.681 --> 01:28:59.201
we got to know each other,

01:28:59.201 --> 01:29:00.801
we relied on each other so much.

01:29:02.081 --> 01:29:03.201
It gave us our own peace
of mind that we could

01:29:03.201 --> 01:29:05.161
settle down and now have a family,

01:29:05.161 --> 01:29:08.641
that we had done something,
we hadn't just been nobodies

01:29:08.641 --> 01:29:10.641
and lived in suburbia all our lives.

01:29:10.641 --> 01:29:12.641
We'd done something that we were proud of,

01:29:12.641 --> 01:29:14.361
that we'd accomplished on our own.

01:29:15.801 --> 01:29:20.721
Being together so much it was
hard but then we settled down,

01:29:20.721 --> 01:29:21.881
and must have settled down really well

01:29:21.881 --> 01:29:24.801
because I got pregnant so something

01:29:24.801 --> 01:29:26.361
must've been going right.

01:29:27.521 --> 01:29:28.721
- The family settled down

01:29:28.721 --> 01:29:30.841
in a working class suburb of Melbourne.

01:29:33.081 --> 01:29:35.001
Are you ambitious for your children Paul?

01:29:35.001 --> 01:29:37.561
- I said something about wanting Robert

01:29:37.561 --> 01:29:40.481
to be a brain surgeon but that was a joke.

01:29:40.481 --> 01:29:42.681
I mean if like if he's
a brain surgeon good

01:29:42.681 --> 01:29:44.881
and well but it'd be nice to let them go

01:29:44.881 --> 01:29:46.961
one step up from us I think.

01:29:49.401 --> 01:29:52.641
At the moment I'm pretty happy with Katy,

01:29:52.641 --> 01:29:54.401
I'm not having a go at
Robert but I've got fears

01:29:54.401 --> 01:29:57.881
for Robert cause he's
struggling a little bit.

01:29:57.881 --> 01:30:00.641
He's only been at school for two years

01:30:00.641 --> 01:30:03.921
and grade one and he's
had three teachers already

01:30:04.921 --> 01:30:07.161
say they don't know how to motivate him.

01:30:07.161 --> 01:30:09.161
What does University mean?

01:30:09.161 --> 01:30:11.401
- When the last show
was on I said to Robert

01:30:11.401 --> 01:30:12.561
do you think you'll go to university?

01:30:12.561 --> 01:30:14.561
He goes well what's university?

01:30:14.561 --> 01:30:15.521
It just floored me.

01:30:16.841 --> 01:30:18.801
It just proves that high education

01:30:19.721 --> 01:30:22.281
isn't a major point to us,
just getting him out of

01:30:22.281 --> 01:30:24.521
first grade was a major importance to us

01:30:24.521 --> 01:30:26.641
and so university seems a long way off

01:30:26.641 --> 01:30:29.401
and so we just take each year as it comes.

01:30:29.401 --> 01:30:30.881
- I was going to be a policeman

01:30:30.881 --> 01:30:34.841
but I thought how hard
it would be to join in.

01:30:36.121 --> 01:30:37.961
I just haven't made up my mind yet.

01:30:37.961 --> 01:30:39.241
I was going to be a phys ed teacher

01:30:39.241 --> 01:30:42.961
but one of the teachers told me you had

01:30:42.961 --> 01:30:44.601
to get up into university.

01:30:46.121 --> 01:30:48.361
- At 21 Paul as
working as a junior partner

01:30:48.361 --> 01:30:50.921
for a firm of bricklayers in Melbourne.

01:30:50.921 --> 01:30:54.481
By 28 he'd gone out on his
own as a sub-contractor

01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:56.081
but it didn't work out.

01:30:56.081 --> 01:30:59.481
Since then he'd had a variety
of jobs in the building trade.

01:30:59.481 --> 01:31:00.841
- Well I'm more of a trades person

01:31:00.841 --> 01:31:02.561
than a business person you know,

01:31:04.081 --> 01:31:05.361
I've never had any business training

01:31:05.361 --> 01:31:09.241
and if I've got natural ability
I probably haven't used it.

01:31:10.201 --> 01:31:11.961
Where do the problems go?

01:31:11.961 --> 01:31:15.401
I mean did I lose it because
of it or did I never have it?

01:31:15.401 --> 01:31:17.361
I think the confidence was never there,

01:31:18.641 --> 01:31:21.441
it might run I the family sort of thing.

01:31:21.441 --> 01:31:24.081
- I think maybe it's the lack
of security maybe he felt

01:31:24.081 --> 01:31:25.921
when he was a child, perhaps,

01:31:25.921 --> 01:31:28.201
that's my theory, my theory alone.

01:31:28.201 --> 01:31:30.201
I mean that's the old thing isn't it,

01:31:30.201 --> 01:31:32.401
when one of your parents are taken away

01:31:32.401 --> 01:31:34.561
from you you lack security.

01:31:35.561 --> 01:31:38.481
- The monitors up in the
washroom sends the nurse

01:31:38.481 --> 01:31:41.721
out well there's no talking
well I wasn't talking.

01:31:41.721 --> 01:31:44.321
- Katy now has this saying,
oh you know me I'm hopeless

01:31:44.321 --> 01:31:47.281
and it's just Paul you know,
oh you know me I can't do this.

01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:48.801
And it's sort of like this
defeatist attitude type

01:31:48.801 --> 01:31:51.241
of thing but oh I don't
know I just ignore it

01:31:51.241 --> 01:31:54.201
and go along my merry way I suppose.

01:31:54.201 --> 01:31:56.361
He has got better, I
think as you get older

01:31:57.321 --> 01:32:00.401
maturer you know, confidence
does come to a point.

01:32:01.921 --> 01:32:04.801
- I really went through
a stage it's so stupid

01:32:04.801 --> 01:32:07.961
because I was only a
bricklayer like I failed.

01:32:07.961 --> 01:32:10.001
Something happened with
that job and I started

01:32:10.001 --> 01:32:12.081
to maybe I did start
to look at what we had

01:32:12.081 --> 01:32:14.401
and think what do you want out of life?

01:32:15.401 --> 01:32:18.681
What's so bad about what we got?

01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:27.841
- Do the two
of you have a dream?

01:32:29.681 --> 01:32:32.561
- I've always wanted
to move to the country.

01:32:32.561 --> 01:32:34.681
I wouldn't mind a small property,

01:32:35.961 --> 01:32:37.321
doesn't have to be big or flashy.

01:32:37.321 --> 01:32:38.761
It's more relaxed style

01:32:38.761 --> 01:32:42.161
of living, an attractive
sort of lifestyle.

01:32:44.361 --> 01:32:46.041
- We've just been
together for so long we're

01:32:46.041 --> 01:32:48.921
just sort of plod along together.

01:32:49.841 --> 01:32:53.801
I enjoy his company and he
enjoys mine most of the time.

01:32:55.241 --> 01:32:57.481
I know that he's going to
come home to me every night,

01:32:57.481 --> 01:32:59.481
I'm going to have someone there.

01:32:59.481 --> 01:33:01.521
He's very secure that way.

01:33:03.241 --> 01:33:05.841
- She does put up with a lot.

01:33:05.841 --> 01:33:08.681
I can't be that easy to live with.

01:33:09.681 --> 01:33:12.921
I'm nice but I'm not easy to live with.

01:33:18.961 --> 01:33:22.321
- Well we pretend we've got swords.

01:33:22.321 --> 01:33:24.161
We make the noises of the swords fighting

01:33:24.161 --> 01:33:26.361
and when somebody stabs us we go aargh.

01:33:28.161 --> 01:33:30.121
If think if you're healthy
and have good friends

01:33:30.121 --> 01:33:31.441
you can get on perfectly well.

01:33:31.441 --> 01:33:33.041
Everybody would like to be rich.

01:33:34.561 --> 01:33:39.561
I came to London and contacted
an agency for squatters

01:33:40.241 --> 01:33:44.361
and they were able to give
me an address of somebody

01:33:44.361 --> 01:33:46.921
who was able to help
people who were looking

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:49.561
for accommodation in the London area.

01:33:49.561 --> 01:33:51.721
- But you've
kicked against the stability.

01:33:53.241 --> 01:33:56.641
- I don't think I ever had any
stability to be quite honest.

01:33:57.761 --> 01:34:00.721
I can't think of any time
in my life when I ever did.

01:34:00.721 --> 01:34:02.601
I don't think I've been
kicking against anything

01:34:02.601 --> 01:34:05.281
I think I've been kicking in
mid air the whole of my life.

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:07.961
I've been moving about a bit

01:34:07.961 --> 01:34:10.721
between difference places
really, a bit unsettled

01:34:10.721 --> 01:34:14.561
but I'm very shortly
moving to live in digs.

01:34:15.841 --> 01:34:19.001
- At 28 Neil was
roaming around Britain.

01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:21.761
We found him on the
west coast of Scotland.

01:34:21.761 --> 01:34:22.641
- If the state didn't give us

01:34:22.641 --> 01:34:24.081
any money it would probably

01:34:24.081 --> 01:34:27.401
just mean crime and I'm
glad I don't have to steal

01:34:27.401 --> 01:34:28.481
to keep myself alive.

01:34:31.081 --> 01:34:33.561
If the money runs out
well then for a few days

01:34:33.561 --> 01:34:36.721
there's nowhere to go to
that's all you can do,

01:34:36.721 --> 01:34:39.201
I simply have to find the
warmest shed I can find.

01:34:41.081 --> 01:34:43.721
- At 35 he's
living in a council flat

01:34:43.721 --> 01:34:45.081
in the Shetland Islands.

01:34:47.601 --> 01:34:48.721
- The nice thing about
here is that you can cut

01:34:48.721 --> 01:34:51.521
yourself off when you want
because there are people

01:34:51.521 --> 01:34:53.921
living around but they're
pretty quiet people.

01:34:55.001 --> 01:34:57.321
It's an environment which
sustains me it's one

01:34:57.321 --> 01:34:58.801
in which I can survive.

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:03.561
I still feel my real place is in the world

01:35:03.561 --> 01:35:07.961
of the world where people are doing

01:35:07.961 --> 01:35:09.521
what the majority of people do.

01:35:11.721 --> 01:35:13.481
And the reason I don't feel safe is

01:35:13.481 --> 01:35:14.561
because I think I'm getting more

01:35:14.561 --> 01:35:17.161
and more used to this lifestyle

01:35:18.081 --> 01:35:20.161
which eventually I shall have to give up.

01:35:21.121 --> 01:35:23.361
- How do you
manage for money these days?

01:35:24.761 --> 01:35:27.521
- Social Security still, I wish it wasn't

01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:28.921
but I'm afraid it is.

01:35:30.721 --> 01:35:32.121
I've no desire to be putting

01:35:32.121 --> 01:35:36.241
the taxes up and drawing money
off people who've earned it

01:35:37.441 --> 01:35:41.081
themselves but that's the way it is.

01:35:42.721 --> 01:35:44.921
Well I'm going to take
people to the country

01:35:44.921 --> 01:35:47.721
and sometimes take them to the sea-side

01:35:47.721 --> 01:35:51.601
and I'll have a big loud
speaker in the motor coach

01:35:51.601 --> 01:35:54.801
and tell them whereabouts
we are and what we're going

01:35:54.801 --> 01:35:59.801
to do and what the name of the
road is and all about that.

01:36:00.281 --> 01:36:02.681
- Neil was brought
up in a Liverpool suburb,

01:36:02.681 --> 01:36:04.601
went to a local comprehensive school

01:36:04.601 --> 01:36:06.601
and Aberdeen University.

01:36:06.601 --> 01:36:08.321
He dropped out after a term

01:36:08.321 --> 01:36:11.241
and at 21 was working on
a building site in London.

01:36:15.241 --> 01:36:17.361
At 28 he was homeless.

01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:20.041
How do people regard you here?

01:36:22.081 --> 01:36:24.481
- Well I'm still
known as an eccentric

01:36:26.241 --> 01:36:31.121
as I have been since
about the age of 16 or so.

01:36:33.081 --> 01:36:35.321
- Do the days seem long for you?

01:36:35.321 --> 01:36:36.161
- They can do.

01:36:42.761 --> 01:36:44.481
- Do you have
any friends anywhere?

01:36:44.481 --> 01:36:46.561
- I've some good friends still in England.

01:36:49.641 --> 01:36:50.761
- Neil settled down

01:36:50.761 --> 01:36:53.441
in the Shetland Islands
a couple of years ago.

01:36:55.161 --> 01:36:56.641
- Hello Neil how are you?

01:36:56.641 --> 01:36:59.121
- Is the
community important to you?

01:36:59.121 --> 01:37:01.441
- Yes, it has to be, this is where I live.

01:37:02.521 --> 01:37:03.841
It's been very good to me.

01:37:04.801 --> 01:37:08.921
People have been especially
kind in many areas

01:37:08.921 --> 01:37:11.801
and I'd like to be putting
something back into it

01:37:11.801 --> 01:37:13.041
and we'd be putting something back

01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:16.241
into the whole of Shetland,
not just into this area.

01:37:18.041 --> 01:37:20.121
I'll take 2 pints of milk please.

01:37:20.121 --> 01:37:21.121
- There we are Neil.

01:37:22.041 --> 01:37:24.001
And how's the pantomime then?

01:37:24.001 --> 01:37:24.961
- Not so bad.

01:37:24.961 --> 01:37:27.201
- Oh that's good, no traumas?

01:37:27.201 --> 01:37:29.201
- Not on my part but people could do

01:37:29.201 --> 01:37:30.721
with learning their lines a bit better.

01:37:30.721 --> 01:37:31.801
- But you're alright.

01:37:31.801 --> 01:37:34.081
- Well I shouldn't speak too soon.

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:36.481
When I grow up I want to be an astronaut

01:37:36.481 --> 01:37:38.601
but if I can't be an astronaut

01:37:38.601 --> 01:37:40.321
I think I'll be a coach driver.

01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:42.481
This probably linked up with the fact now

01:37:42.481 --> 01:37:44.241
that I want to travel I mean my thoughts

01:37:44.241 --> 01:37:46.201
haven't really changed that much

01:37:46.201 --> 01:37:47.761
but I definitely wouldn't
like to be a coach driver now.

01:37:50.801 --> 01:37:55.241
I suppose I would, yes, well
I would like to be somebody

01:37:55.241 --> 01:37:58.961
in a position of importance,
I've always thought this

01:37:58.961 --> 01:38:00.801
but I don't think I'm
the right sort of person

01:38:00.801 --> 01:38:03.041
to carry the responsibility
for whatever it is.

01:38:03.041 --> 01:38:07.521
I've always though well I'd
love to be possibly love

01:38:07.521 --> 01:38:11.041
to be in politics or something like this

01:38:11.041 --> 01:38:14.801
but I'd probably find that just as tedious

01:38:14.801 --> 01:38:17.961
as all the other jobs I've done so.

01:38:19.521 --> 01:38:21.841
What were the things I
always thought I could do.

01:38:23.561 --> 01:38:27.321
I could give lectures on erudite subjects

01:38:27.321 --> 01:38:31.841
that I'd read all about or
I could work in the theatre,

01:38:32.921 --> 01:38:37.761
perhaps lighting or directing a show.

01:38:42.121 --> 01:38:43.241
- And is all that lost to you?

01:38:43.241 --> 01:38:44.441
- Does seem to be yes.

01:39:02.241 --> 01:39:06.441
- The village pantomime
1990 Beauty and the Beast.

01:39:14.401 --> 01:39:15.801
- Matthew Matthew

01:39:23.801 --> 01:39:25.761
Your house sir is needing some repairs.

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.161
I think the attendance
at last years pantomime

01:39:29.161 --> 01:39:32.001
on the Saturday night
was the biggest crowd

01:39:32.001 --> 01:39:35.041
of West of Shetland folk
I'd ever seen in one place.

01:39:35.041 --> 01:39:37.681
And you know and we think they enjoyed it.

01:39:42.561 --> 01:39:45.201
We had good receptions in other
parts of Shetland as well.

01:39:45.201 --> 01:39:46.841
We did tour one play.

01:39:46.841 --> 01:39:47.681
I think were moving

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:50.721
into an age when there's
going to be more stress

01:39:50.721 --> 01:39:51.961
on the community.

01:39:51.961 --> 01:39:54.001
When bigger policies are fairly set,

01:39:54.001 --> 01:39:56.881
are fairly predictable, and the emphasis

01:39:56.881 --> 01:39:59.561
is gonna fall on local organisation.

01:40:01.881 --> 01:40:03.561
- You directed it last year

01:40:03.561 --> 01:40:05.441
and you're not this year why is that?

01:40:07.081 --> 01:40:10.161
- Well the specific reason is that we had

01:40:10.161 --> 01:40:12.401
a preliminary meeting and
I was, my name was not

01:40:12.401 --> 01:40:16.121
put forward as the one they wanted so.

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.001
- Why would that be?

01:40:23.561 --> 01:40:26.881
- Probably because I like
to do things in my own way

01:40:26.881 --> 01:40:29.601
I'm perhaps quite an
authoritative director

01:40:29.601 --> 01:40:32.761
I have my own idea of the performance

01:40:32.761 --> 01:40:35.201
before we even start
and I don't like people

01:40:35.201 --> 01:40:36.921
to deviate from that and during the course

01:40:36.921 --> 01:40:39.081
of production of course people
come along with suggestions.

01:40:39.081 --> 01:40:41.321
No I accept suggestions,
I don't just go along

01:40:41.321 --> 01:40:43.881
without listening to people
but I know how I want the thing

01:40:43.881 --> 01:40:46.161
and once I deviate once from that idea,

01:40:46.161 --> 01:40:47.601
the whole thing actually falls apart.

01:40:47.601 --> 01:40:49.401
It's not a work of art any more.

01:40:49.401 --> 01:40:51.641
I'm not claiming that I
produce marvellous works of art

01:40:51.641 --> 01:40:53.441
but I do know what I'm aiming for.

01:40:54.361 --> 01:40:59.361
Alas poor master, still
sleeping, shall I awaken him.

01:41:00.881 --> 01:41:02.521
I think everybody wants to be somebody

01:41:02.521 --> 01:41:03.921
and when you can't actually be anything

01:41:03.921 --> 01:41:06.721
in your ordinary life if
you feel there's a sphere

01:41:06.721 --> 01:41:08.961
in which you can excel then it's great.

01:41:08.961 --> 01:41:12.241
I mean I know how much pleasure
people who take photographs

01:41:12.241 --> 01:41:14.001
get when their work is praised

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:17.321
and that's perhaps it's
much the same thing.

01:41:18.321 --> 01:41:20.641
- We'll just taking take
a quick look at your plan

01:41:20.641 --> 01:41:21.641
and see how it stands.

01:41:21.641 --> 01:41:24.201
- What I have done is
taken lists of all the

01:41:24.201 --> 01:41:26.881
community halls in Shetland
with their capacity.

01:41:26.881 --> 01:41:28.321
- Neil is trying to organise

01:41:28.321 --> 01:41:30.481
a professional touring theatre company.

01:41:30.481 --> 01:41:33.001
- If a hall only seats
60 people it may not

01:41:33.001 --> 01:41:35.241
be worth putting on a show there.

01:41:36.241 --> 01:41:37.201
- I mean what was your
response at the fact

01:41:37.201 --> 01:41:38.881
that only 4 folk turned up at the.

01:41:40.201 --> 01:41:42.041
- Disappointment, it was disappointment.

01:41:42.041 --> 01:41:44.561
I was disappointed but I
think it proves the point

01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:46.321
that I've been trying to
make that you can't just

01:41:46.321 --> 01:41:48.881
except people to turn up for
a group from outside Shetland

01:41:48.881 --> 01:41:50.481
when they don't know
what the things about.

01:41:54.161 --> 01:41:56.001
I've had an instinctive
feeling that I was a writer

01:41:56.001 --> 01:41:59.281
since I was 16, I never really
wanted to be anything else.

01:42:00.561 --> 01:42:02.241
I would actually pay to
have something published.

01:42:02.241 --> 01:42:04.481
I think that's important I
think if I could find somebody

01:42:04.481 --> 01:42:06.801
that would recognise,
there must be something

01:42:06.801 --> 01:42:07.641
in what I've done.

01:42:07.641 --> 01:42:08.801
I don't think it's all useless.

01:42:08.801 --> 01:42:11.561
I probably am overvaluing it
but I know how much effort

01:42:11.561 --> 01:42:14.721
went into some of it and
on that strength alone

01:42:14.721 --> 01:42:16.401
I just can't believe it's useless.

01:42:17.521 --> 01:42:20.241
With each successive play
I don't know who I'm trying

01:42:20.241 --> 01:42:23.161
to speak to and what I'm
trying to say to them

01:42:23.161 --> 01:42:25.961
and whether they're
listening I just keep going

01:42:25.961 --> 01:42:28.241
because that's what I
feel I should be doing.

01:42:28.241 --> 01:42:30.561
In the winter, if you live in the country,

01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:32.961
well it's just all wet and
there wouldn't be anything

01:42:32.961 --> 01:42:37.961
for miles around and you'd
get soaked if you tried

01:42:38.041 --> 01:42:41.001
to go out and there's no
shelter anywhere except

01:42:41.001 --> 01:42:42.521
in your own house.

01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:44.041
But in the town you can go out

01:42:44.041 --> 01:42:46.841
on wet wintry days cause you
can always find somewhere

01:42:46.841 --> 01:42:49.361
to shelter because there's lots of places.

01:42:51.041 --> 01:42:53.521
I don't think I've been
typical of the environment

01:42:53.521 --> 01:42:54.561
in which I lived.

01:42:54.561 --> 01:42:56.161
What my background has given me

01:42:56.161 --> 01:43:01.161
is a sense of just being part
of a very impersonal society.

01:43:03.121 --> 01:43:05.441
You finish the week you come home you plug

01:43:05.441 --> 01:43:07.081
into the TV set for the weekend

01:43:07.081 --> 01:43:10.161
and then you manage to get
back to work on Monday.

01:43:10.161 --> 01:43:13.161
And it seems to me this
is just a slow path

01:43:13.161 --> 01:43:15.801
to total brain washing and if I you have

01:43:15.801 --> 01:43:18.321
a brain washed society
then you're heading towards

01:43:18.321 --> 01:43:20.121
doom there's no question about that.

01:43:21.401 --> 01:43:23.321
- Well it weren't too
bad last night anyway.

01:43:23.321 --> 01:43:26.121
- It was better than it's
been for a while I think.

01:43:26.121 --> 01:43:27.521
- There was enormous
reaction to you in the

01:43:27.521 --> 01:43:30.321
previous film what do people
see in you do you think?

01:43:31.321 --> 01:43:32.921
- It's seemed that I was representing some

01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:36.321
kind of successful escapism or somebody

01:43:36.321 --> 01:43:39.041
who'd managed to be totally himself,

01:43:39.041 --> 01:43:41.961
hadn't given in to pressure of society

01:43:41.961 --> 01:43:45.361
to conform and people
flooded me with letters

01:43:45.361 --> 01:43:46.201
and people seemed to think

01:43:46.201 --> 01:43:48.001
I could solve their personal problems.

01:43:48.001 --> 01:43:50.801
And I was quite frightened
because I knew I couldn't

01:43:50.801 --> 01:43:53.041
but what really bothered
me was people seemed

01:43:53.041 --> 01:43:56.201
to see something in me that I
hadn't been aware of myself.

01:43:56.201 --> 01:43:58.561
All I was aware of was that
I didn't have anywhere to go,

01:43:58.561 --> 01:44:01.281
I had nothing to do I'd no money,

01:44:01.281 --> 01:44:03.921
I felt let down by quite a lot of people.

01:44:03.921 --> 01:44:05.481
I didn't think my life was a success

01:44:05.481 --> 01:44:07.321
but suddenly everybody seemed to think so

01:44:07.321 --> 01:44:08.921
but the most nagging
thing was that whatever,

01:44:08.921 --> 01:44:10.601
even if a million people had written to me

01:44:10.601 --> 01:44:12.881
it wouldn't have made any
difference to my own situation.

01:44:12.881 --> 01:44:15.801
When I get married I don't
want to have any children

01:44:16.841 --> 01:44:20.801
because they're always
doing naughty things

01:44:20.801 --> 01:44:24.321
and making the whole house untidy.

01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:28.001
I always told myself that I
would never have children.

01:44:30.601 --> 01:44:32.081
- Why?

01:44:32.081 --> 01:44:37.081
- Because, because, well
because children inherit

01:44:37.481 --> 01:44:39.281
something from their parents.

01:44:39.281 --> 01:44:40.641
And even if my wife

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:44.241
were the most high spirited and ordinary

01:44:44.241 --> 01:44:47.641
and normal of people the
child would still stand

01:44:47.641 --> 01:44:52.321
a very fair chance of
being not totally full

01:44:52.321 --> 01:44:54.641
of happiness because of what he

01:44:54.641 --> 01:44:57.921
or she would've inherited from me.

01:44:57.921 --> 01:44:59.601
- Have you given up on women?

01:45:02.281 --> 01:45:07.001
- Well, what how shall
we say, all but you know.

01:45:07.001 --> 01:45:08.841
I mean there's always, everybody always,

01:45:08.841 --> 01:45:12.081
every unmarried man and
every unmarried woman hopes

01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:14.401
for somebody who will actually come along

01:45:14.401 --> 01:45:15.721
to change their life.

01:45:15.721 --> 01:45:18.001
But the practical reality

01:45:18.001 --> 01:45:19.961
is the chances of my finding somebody

01:45:19.961 --> 01:45:24.961
who would put up with me
in my integrity is are few.

01:45:31.401 --> 01:45:33.921
- What would
you look for in a woman?

01:45:33.921 --> 01:45:35.481
- Well I might look for various things

01:45:35.481 --> 01:45:36.641
but what's probably more important is

01:45:36.641 --> 01:45:38.161
what somebody would look for in me.

01:45:38.161 --> 01:45:40.001
I can't offer reliability.

01:45:40.001 --> 01:45:41.961
I mean most women looking for a husband

01:45:41.961 --> 01:45:44.761
or a steady man wants somebody

01:45:44.761 --> 01:45:46.641
who is reliable in some way or other.

01:45:46.641 --> 01:45:48.361
I cannot offer that.

01:45:48.361 --> 01:45:49.201
Because I don't know
what I'm going to be like

01:45:49.201 --> 01:45:50.641
from one day to the other and
it would be foolish for me

01:45:50.641 --> 01:45:53.681
pretending you know that I
could offer something like that.

01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:57.561
I can offer sincerity,
I can offer compassion,

01:45:59.761 --> 01:46:04.761
willingness to do my part
to put my wife's interests

01:46:04.921 --> 01:46:08.721
as high as my own, no doubt these are,

01:46:08.721 --> 01:46:09.961
I'm sure these are important.

01:46:09.961 --> 01:46:12.321
But I cannot say look in

01:46:12.321 --> 01:46:15.721
10 years time I'll still
be bringing in a wage in,

01:46:15.721 --> 01:46:19.641
especially if I don't start
in that situation, you know.

01:46:19.641 --> 01:46:21.801
- Do you
worry about your sanity?

01:46:25.161 --> 01:46:27.441
- Other people sometimes worry about it.

01:46:28.961 --> 01:46:30.721
- Like who?

01:46:34.241 --> 01:46:38.641
- As I said, I sometimes
can be found behaving

01:46:38.641 --> 01:46:43.041
in an erratic fashion,
sometimes get very frustrated,

01:46:43.041 --> 01:46:45.721
very angry for no apparent reason.

01:46:45.721 --> 01:46:47.401
For a reason which won't be apparent

01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:48.681
to other people around me.

01:46:52.041 --> 01:46:53.401
It's happened from time to time.

01:46:56.721 --> 01:46:57.961
- Are you
getting better or worse

01:46:57.961 --> 01:46:59.561
do you think your state?

01:46:59.561 --> 01:47:02.201
- I don't think there's any
significant change in me,

01:47:03.041 --> 01:47:04.801
I said I haven't been so depressed

01:47:04.801 --> 01:47:06.561
since I've been in Shetland,

01:47:06.561 --> 01:47:09.241
I suppose my basic personality
is not a lot different.

01:47:10.241 --> 01:47:12.121
- Are you having
any medical treatment

01:47:12.121 --> 01:47:13.561
for your mood changes?

01:47:13.561 --> 01:47:16.041
- No I haven't for many
years because I wouldn't like

01:47:16.041 --> 01:47:20.201
to be dependent upon man
made substances for a cure.

01:47:21.641 --> 01:47:23.641
- Do you ever
think you're going mad?

01:47:23.641 --> 01:47:26.481
- I don't think it I know it.

01:47:26.481 --> 01:47:31.481
I, well we're not allowed
to use the word mad

01:47:33.641 --> 01:47:38.001
but you know, I think
most people are mad here

01:47:40.041 --> 01:47:41.641
but I think it's a mad world.

01:47:41.641 --> 01:47:45.841
I think I remember walking
in London 12 years ago

01:47:45.841 --> 01:47:48.881
and just walking through the city

01:47:48.881 --> 01:47:50.561
and they were digging up the drains

01:47:50.561 --> 01:47:52.961
and there were cranes
knocking down buildings

01:47:52.961 --> 01:47:54.601
and there were cars trying to get down

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:57.841
impossible narrow alleys and
having to reverse out again

01:47:57.841 --> 01:48:00.601
and policemen doing all kinds of things

01:48:00.601 --> 01:48:01.921
and I thought this world
is just mad you know,

01:48:01.921 --> 01:48:03.921
this world is just mad.

01:48:03.921 --> 01:48:05.721
Yes I'd say I believed in God.

01:48:05.721 --> 01:48:07.161
- Are you religious?

01:48:08.441 --> 01:48:10.841
- Well I go to church with
my parents on Sundays.

01:48:11.801 --> 01:48:14.561
I don't know even know whether
I do believe in God or not.

01:48:14.561 --> 01:48:17.321
I thought an awful lot about it actually

01:48:17.321 --> 01:48:20.481
and I still don't know
but I still led to believe

01:48:20.481 --> 01:48:21.561
that it was absolutely certain if one was

01:48:21.561 --> 01:48:24.561
to survive in the world
one had to believe in God.

01:48:24.561 --> 01:48:26.481
- And how's
he been treating you?

01:48:27.641 --> 01:48:29.921
- Well I said to somebody last week

01:48:29.921 --> 01:48:31.721
that I preferred the Old Testament

01:48:31.721 --> 01:48:35.601
to the New Testament because
in the Old Testament God

01:48:35.601 --> 01:48:40.161
is very unpredictable
and that's I think how

01:48:40.161 --> 01:48:42.881
I see him in my life.

01:48:42.881 --> 01:48:45.561
Sometimes very benevolent,

01:48:45.561 --> 01:48:49.361
sometimes seemingly needlessly unkind.

01:48:49.361 --> 01:48:52.841
Well after I'd tried every
remedy one could possibly

01:48:52.841 --> 01:48:55.961
think of for my personality disorders,

01:48:57.161 --> 01:48:59.281
I thought well I'm going to trust God

01:48:59.281 --> 01:49:02.201
because other people
have done so seemingly

01:49:02.201 --> 01:49:04.881
with positive results.

01:49:04.881 --> 01:49:08.601
I can't say the moment I
trusted God my life was fine

01:49:08.601 --> 01:49:10.961
and I can't say all the time

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:14.881
that I think I've found
the answer but I can say

01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:17.161
with some certainty that
once I started believing

01:49:17.161 --> 01:49:21.961
that there is actually a God
who has something of a design

01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:24.841
for the world, who is working
in a certain way in the world.

01:49:24.841 --> 01:49:27.761
After that some things
became clearer to me,

01:49:28.801 --> 01:49:30.761
I really can't say much more than that.

01:49:32.201 --> 01:49:35.601
- Coloured people we
don't like them very much.

01:49:35.601 --> 01:49:40.001
- No it sounds like
ghostly coloured people,

01:49:40.001 --> 01:49:42.041
you think of a sort of purple person

01:49:42.041 --> 01:49:44.641
with red eyes and yellow feet

01:49:44.641 --> 01:49:48.881
and you can't really think of
what they really look like.

01:49:50.001 --> 01:49:52.401
I find it hard to believe
that I was ever like that

01:49:52.401 --> 01:49:53.841
but there's the evidence.

01:49:54.801 --> 01:49:57.521
Probably when I was seven I
just lived in a wonderful world

01:49:57.521 --> 01:49:59.161
where everything was all sensation

01:49:59.161 --> 01:50:00.721
and them I could be happy like this,

01:50:00.721 --> 01:50:02.721
I could be miserable the next one.

01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:08.881
I don't have a yearning for
any past time in my life.

01:50:08.881 --> 01:50:10.961
Perhaps in my subconscious
I could recall a time

01:50:10.961 --> 01:50:12.601
when everything was a lot happier

01:50:13.481 --> 01:50:15.921
my teens were terribly unhappy years.

01:50:18.321 --> 01:50:19.801
- If we come back in 7 years

01:50:19.801 --> 01:50:22.601
how would you like us to find you?

01:50:24.281 --> 01:50:27.321
- In a job from which I
was getting satisfaction,

01:50:28.401 --> 01:50:35.601
married, probably with
children, with a good salary.

01:50:38.281 --> 01:50:41.241
Enough to as I said before to be able

01:50:41.241 --> 01:50:44.961
to live fairly comfortably
and with friends

01:50:44.961 --> 01:50:48.001
who I could contact when I wanted them.

01:50:48.921 --> 01:50:50.721
- So do you
think you have failed?

01:50:55.521 --> 01:50:56.561
- Can't really judge.

01:51:00.041 --> 01:51:02.201
- Do you feel
you've failed yourself?

01:51:03.481 --> 01:51:04.801
- Well my life isn't over.

01:51:11.201 --> 01:51:13.241
- Can you think what you'd like

01:51:13.241 --> 01:51:16.761
to be doing in the year 2000?

01:51:16.761 --> 01:51:18.801
- I can think of all kinds of
things I'd like to be doing.

01:51:18.801 --> 01:51:23.161
The real question is what
am I likely to be doing?

01:51:29.081 --> 01:51:31.441
- What are
you likely to be doing?

01:51:31.441 --> 01:51:32.881
- That's a horrible question.

01:51:34.481 --> 01:51:37.401
I tend to think most likely the answer is

01:51:37.401 --> 01:51:39.281
I will be wandering
homeless around the streets

01:51:39.281 --> 01:51:42.641
of London but with a bit
of luck that won't happen.

01:51:46.841 --> 01:51:50.081
I always feel that somehow
a good fairy has waved

01:51:50.081 --> 01:51:52.361
a wand over me and saved
me from that because

01:51:52.361 --> 01:51:55.721
that seemed very much what
the end would be for a while.

01:51:55.721 --> 01:51:59.801
That's why I cling on here,
I know how tempting it is

01:51:59.801 --> 01:52:02.441
to escape into fantasies, to believe

01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:04.721
that I already am a successful writer.

01:52:04.721 --> 01:52:07.121
To believe that I've got lots of friends,

01:52:07.121 --> 01:52:09.441
to believe that if only I had
done such and such my life,

01:52:09.441 --> 01:52:11.761
would've been different but I
mean the most difficult thing

01:52:11.761 --> 01:52:15.761
is to accept the reality, to
be what we are in a situation.

01:52:16.761 --> 01:52:17.681
That's terribly difficult.

01:52:26.401 --> 01:52:27.681
- No not intentionally.

01:52:27.681 --> 01:52:31.361
- I must you, I'm a
moustache fellow, a beard.

01:52:39.041 --> 01:52:40.961
- At the end
of their very special day

01:52:40.961 --> 01:52:45.281
in London after their trip
to the zoo and the party.

01:52:45.281 --> 01:52:48.321
We took our children to
an adventure playground

01:52:48.321 --> 01:52:50.361
where they could do just what they liked.

01:52:53.161 --> 01:52:56.441
Those from the children's home
set about building a house.

01:53:01.121 --> 01:53:02.041
There's Nicholas.

01:53:09.241 --> 01:53:14.241
And Tony.

01:53:17.281 --> 01:53:18.121
Andrew.

01:53:23.721 --> 01:53:24.561
And Bruce

01:53:30.961 --> 01:53:31.801
John.

01:53:39.361 --> 01:53:40.201
Suzi.

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:50.201
Jackie and her friends.

01:53:56.121 --> 01:53:58.961
Give me a child until he is seven

01:53:58.961 --> 01:54:00.441
and I will give you the man.

01:54:09.841 --> 01:54:13.001
This has been a glimpse
of Britain's future.
