WEBVTT

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.915
<i>Welcome back, SG-9.
Stay in the gate room.</i>

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.958
<i>General Landry will be down
for a short debrief.</i>

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.758
So, after 10 years
and about 1,000 e-mail requests,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.593
I finally get my own parking spot.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.238
Two days after...

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.269
Sir.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.595
Sir.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.431
- Major Davis.
- Morning.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.870
- Good morning, Colonels.
- Major.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.920
Dial it up, Chief. They're right on schedule.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.558
- What am I signing this time?
- Nothing, sir, just wanted your autograph.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.789
<i>Chevron one encoded.</i>

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.519
Sure you don't want to come along, sir?
Might never be another one of these.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.354
Tempting as it is, I'll be doing paperwork
the whole time you're gone.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.513
Besides, one general
looking over your shoulders is plenty.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.636
Yes, speaking of Jack...

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.633
He went ahead with SG-3
to officially hand over the prisoner.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.392
Well, I guess he knows
who we're dealing with.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.471
Such precautions are unnecessary.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.313
Half of the free Jaffa fleet stands guard
over the Tok'ra homeworld

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.517
to ensure that the execution of Ba'al
takes place as planned.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.275
You know better than anyone, muscles,
this is an extraction, not an execution.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.032
<i>Chevron three encoded.</i>

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.029
Oh, well, this is just in case.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.830
No. No, no. Airman, you're not walking
into my first extraction ceremony

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.069
carrying that thing.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.869
- Whoa, wait a minute. This is your first?
- Yeah, it should be interesting.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.475
- It'll blow your mind.
- It is pretty incredible.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.677
Well, witnessing a Goa'uld
being extracted from a host is one thing.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.036
Actually experiencing it is something else.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.633
<i>Chevron five encoded.</i>

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.872
To feel the sensation of the symbiote
that has controlled your every action

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.599
for so many years,
while you watched helplessly

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.148
from the darkest recess of your mind,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.314
as it is finally excised from your body
and left to writhe in the light of day...

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.152
<i>Chevron six encoded.</i>

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.469
Well, that is incredible.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.278
<i>Chevron seven locked!</i>

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.596
- Go to it, SG-1.
- Okay, this I gotta see.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.397
I'll leave the light on.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.669
Never in the history of boredom

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.514
has anyone been more bored
than I am right now.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.799
- Come on, sir, it's only been... Whoa.
- It's almost over.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.710
The crimes they're listing
are starting to sound familiar.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.392
Crimes?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.358
That's what they've been crooning about
for the last three hours?

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.509
Quite the ditty, ain't it?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.034
It's not at all fair to the host,
anyway.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.910
Vala, you don't really think
there's any hope for the...

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.594
I mean, you were host to Qetesh
for a relatively short period of time.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.432
Ba'al's been inhabiting this guy
for over 2,000 years.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.272
Revive the prisoner.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.790
- Watch him try and make a run for it.
- Well, with all this security,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.872
I really don't think
he's going to get very far.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.475
Vala?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.470
The prisoner will step forward.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.157
Ba'al, last of the Goa'uld System Lords,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.794
murderer of untold millions,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.435
these will be your last words.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.035
Speak.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.234
I have nothing to say to the Tok'ra.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.356
SG-1 and General Jack O'Neill.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.479
Well, well.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.156
- How's tricks, B?
- I've been better, I'm afraid. And you?

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.193
- Not so bad, actually. Quite good.
- How nice for you.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.319
- How about those last words?
- As you wish.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.794
Teal'c...

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.355
I will always regret
that you never became my First Prime.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.113
- And where is my dear Qetesh?
- Well, Vala was here.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.990
- Interesting.
- Oh, she's probably gone to the bathroom,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.993
for heaven's sake.
I'm next in line, by the way.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.197
- Can we get on with this?
- There is one more thing.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.311
You've all made a terrible mistake.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.593
- Yes, that is what they all say.
- There can be no doubt of your crimes.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.468
What I mean to say is, I'm not the last
of the Goa'uld System Lords,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.472
though I do admit,
I may be last of the clones.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.996
There were so many of us.
It is difficult to be certain.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.313
Mitchell?

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.551
We tracked them all, sir.
This one is the last one.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.594
You sure?

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.992
That is, after all, why we've come,
why we had to endure all that singing.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.917
Get rid of the last bad guy,
and then there's cake.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.435
Carter?

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.476
Well, as you know,
in order to track his clones,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.758
Ba'al gave each of them a tracking device
detectable from anywhere in the galaxy.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.239
Now, he also placed one in himself,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.673
so we wouldn't be able
to tell the difference

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.239
between a clone and the original.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.073
And because he was the original,
he was the only one of us

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.391
who possessed a tracking device
that could be removed.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.119
So, you see,
the last of the Goa'uld System Lords,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.239
the last of my dear brothers
is still out there,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.709
and since as of this moment
he knows he's the last,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.191
- he has very special plans for you.
- "Plans," you say.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.635
A recently completed failsafe device

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.033
should an unfortunate circumstance,
such as my imminent death, arise.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.113
It was you who gave us the idea, actually.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.911
I suspect it has already been put
into action.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.434
He lies.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.158
He does that, you know.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.993
We shall see.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.279
It is time.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.359
This is going to be cool.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.149
Make your course
three-five-zero.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.390
Three-five-zero. Aye, Captain.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.869
We'd be in Boston by now

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.758
if we weren't zigzagging
all over the bloody Atlantic.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.638
You'd rather make it easy for the U-boats?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.517
We're not at war yet.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.388
Besides, we're riding too high in the water
for a U-boat captain to waste a torpedo.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.916
Check to see the cargo's secure.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.719
You're never going to tell me
what it is, are you?

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.438
If I knew myself...

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.072
That's no torpedo.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.438
What is it, Captain?

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.635
<i>Emergency stations! All hands!</i>

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.355
- Maintain your heading, son.
- Aye, sir.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.317
I'm gonna check for damage.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.713
Secure the ship.
Make ready the Chappa'ai.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.357
Take your time, Jaffa.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.794
We have all the time in the world.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.996
Begin the extraction process.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.314
Seriously, did anybody see
where Vala went?

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.994
Maybe extractions bring up
too many bad memories.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.914
Hey, have you ever tried
to find a bathroom in a pyramid?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.958
She cannot have gone far, O'Neill.
There are...

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.316
- Carter?
- I don't know, sir. He wasn't beamed out.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.198
- It's like he was there one second, and...
- The next he was gone, just like Vala.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.872
I think we'd better get the hell out of here.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.477
Everyone, remain calm!

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.875
What have you done with my people?

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.595
Sir!

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.474
Jack.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.913
Go to the gate.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.679
- Not without you.
- Go.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.554
All right, you heard the man. Let's go.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.469
Carter!

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.152
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.756
The vessel is secure, my lord.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.078
Dial the Chappa'ai.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.869
Jackson!

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.475
Move!

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.598
Okay, not Earth.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.033
- I dialed Earth.
- Yeah, I know,

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.872
like I've seen you do
a hundred times before,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.111
but my keen professional eye
is seeing a few differences

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.634
between this place
and Stargate Command.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:23.158
That, for one, and...
The stargate is in a box.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.391
Carter, what's going on?

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.515
Sam?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.633
I don't know.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.191
Look, I know what happened back there,
but we need you in the here and now.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.396
Wherever or whenever that is.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.233
Right. Right.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.829
Okay.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.270
Looks like the active gate
warmed things up for a bit.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.075
Warmed things up?

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.038
Yeah, because the temperature's
falling again.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.633
It's just gone past minus 20.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.757
Okay, that's chilly.
Let's not just stand around.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.274
I don't see anything that could be a DHD.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.793
This has to be connected
to what was happening

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.791
on the Tok'ra homeworld.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.350
All right, so Vala and Teal'c
disappear into thin air,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.750
we gate into somebody's freezer,

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.116
put the pieces
of that puzzle together, and...

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.073
I got nothing. You?

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.118
Well, there is almost no EM of any kind
from any direction

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.431
to help us determine our location.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.198
Mayday. Mayday.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.830
This is Colonel Cameron Mitchell.
Do you hear me? Please respond.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.148
Mayday. Mayday.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.993
I don't think anybody's going to hear you.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.479
- We're in the cargo hold of a ship.
What?

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.872
Not just any ship.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.360
<i>- This is the Achilles.
- That name's familiar.</i>

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.839
Yeah, because it was the ship
that brought the stargate

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.480
from Africa to America
before the outbreak of World War II.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.073
No, that's not why.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.799
See, at the time, they thought the stargate
might be a weapon of some kind,

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.438
so they wanted to keep it
out of the hands of the Nazis.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.589
Do you realize what this means?

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.035
Guys, I hate to interrupt,
but the temperature's falling.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.872
We just passed minus 40.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.633
- Celsius or Fahrenheit?
- At that temperature, they're the same.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.517
Really? Didn't know that.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.068
We've got about three minutes
before frostbite sets in.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.276
Hypothermia, five minutes after that.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.715
I'm already starting
to lose the feeling in my fingers.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.030
All right, break out the camp stove
from the emergency pack.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.839
Oh, you mean the one
that was with Teal'c?

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.715
We can't light a fire in here.
There's nowhere to vent the smoke.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.313
Cover your ears.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.919
You realize that's not going to
do much.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.592
I'm not done yet.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.996
If you don't blow a hole in the ice
with that, the entire blast is going

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.877
to come flying back
into this compartment.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.112
Or worse, what if that ice
is holding back seawater?

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.193
Yeah, I admit, there's a few problems
with this idea.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.235
Carter, how cold is it?

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.389
Uh...

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.514
Minus 43.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.995
Fire in the hole.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.552
Well, it's warmer.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.958
Yeah, I'm seeing stars.
Let's get this fire started.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.474
What was that?

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.677
Okay, the explosion must've
dislodged the ship from the ice.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.910
Don't tell me. We're sinking.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.640
- Well, we had to leave sooner or later!
- Foul-weather gear.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.518
There's got to be some
around here somewhere.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.391
Hey, we've got water coming in over here!

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.277
Hey, I've got something!

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.070
Jackson, try this on for size!

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.349
Carter!

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.832
Hey, we've got to go!

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.869
Jackson!

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.754
Jackson!

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.998
The ship was warmer.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.470
- You want to go back?
- No, I'm good.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.394
All right. So, which way?

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.553
Well, we're above the Arctic Circle,
so does it really matter?

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.029
- South it is.
- Daniel!

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.115
I know.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.634
Back on the ship,
my foot went through the deck

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.075
where water was coming in.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.550
It froze the laces on my boots.
I couldn't get it off.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.794
Jackson, what did you want to go
and do that for?

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.518
Look, we'll just have to help you walk.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.279
No, I can't feel a thing below my knee.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.635
I don't think I'm going anywhere.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.430
Look, I'm being selfish, here.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.156
Our only chance is for you guys to get
within radio range of some kind of help.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.789
The sooner you go,
the sooner you can send help back for me.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.792
Go, don't waste time!

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.077
Once that sun rises,
it's going to warm right up.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.434
Jackson.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.348
Daniel.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.595
Bye.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.599
Oh, shit!

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.915
I keep wondering
what Daniel was going to say.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.991
When?
- Back at the ship, he got all excited

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.275
when he said,
"Do you realize what this means?"

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.157
Well, obviously, that Ba'al
had gone back in time

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.912
and stopped the ship
that was carrying the stargate

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.718
from ever reaching the United States.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.951
By sending it to the North Pole.
Yeah, apparently.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.118
Carter, that is a terrible plan.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.272
Yeah, but you have no problem
with the fact that he went back in time?

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.635
All I'm saying is,
why not just sink the damn boat?

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.872
I think the bigger point here
is that Ba'al has rewritten history.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.236
Teal'c and Vala just disappeared
because they never joined SG-1.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.436
The stargate program never happened.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.750
In which case,
I would have never crashed in my F-302,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.593
which means I wouldn't have
a titanium pin in my leg, killing me,

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.591
- which it is, right now.
- You're right.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.955
- You're right, it's a paradox.
- Thank you.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.998
Or maybe because we were in transit
through the stargate

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.514
when the timeline shifted.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.512
Well, Ba'al never would've intended
that gate to wind up anywhere

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.670
but the bottom of the ocean.
Something went wrong,

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.399
and we were not supposed
to make it back to Earth alive.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.118
That's his first mistake.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.430
Maybe he's already taken over
the entire planet.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.476
I mean, humanity could be enslaved,
for all we know.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.835
That's quitter talk.
All we got to do is stay alive

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.354
until you figure a way to undo this.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.911
- Undo this?
- You heard me.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.072
Mayday. Mayday!

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.913
This is Colonel Cameron Mitchell. Mayday!

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.029
Mayday!

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.068
Sam, we have to keep moving.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.513
Why?

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.991
If we're going to freeze to death,
here's as good a spot as any, isn't it?

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.115
Uh...

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.113
I don't like this spot.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:58.116
Cam, come on. What is the point?
There's no one around for hundreds of...

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.639
What is that?

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.509
Hey!

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.671
- Which one of you is Mitchell?
- That'd be me.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.231
- Jack O'Neill, Special Forces.
- Oh, my God!

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.551
We thought you were dead.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.071
Well, back at you, ma'am.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.718
- Do you recognize her?
- Sure do.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.475
Sir, we've got to go back for Daniel.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.393
What we have to do
is get you people off this ice.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.038
- Major Wood!
- Yes, sir!

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.192
I marked the "X" and dropped the buoy.
It should be along any minute, sir.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:01.159
Mitchell, I don't know what you're doing
in the Arctic with a dead astronaut,

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.674
but I'm going to need some answers.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.794
Yeah, well, back at you.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.350
What are we looking for?

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.749
There! Your ride!

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.032
Colonel O'Neill!

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.078
- Permission to come aboard!
- Permission granted, sir.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.230
The C.O. Would like you to make it snappy.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.073
Sonar picked up
a Russian sub nosing around.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.908
Let's go.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.237
- Down scope.
- Aye, sir.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.235
<i>- Colonel, welcome aboard the Alexandria.
- Captain, thanks for the ride.</i>

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.231
We're always happy to help the Air Force.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.117
Chief of the boat,
escort our guests to the ward room.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.317
Escort our guests to the ward room.
Aye, Captain.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.679
- Colonel, isn't that...
- If it isn't, it's her twin sister.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.149
I'm going to need a couple minutes
to debrief those two.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.958
You mean those three.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.709
What?

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.472
Officer of the deck,
prepare to stationary dive.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.950
- I intend to take her down immediately.
- Prepare to stationary dive. Aye, Captain.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.076
Stationary dive, stationary dive.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.356
- Jackson!
- Hey!

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.396
- Daniel.
- Hi!

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.959
I didn't think you guys
were going to make it.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.473
Us? What about you?

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.156
Oh, no, the sub actually came up
about a half hour after you guys left.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.037
<i>It must have heard
the Achilles going down.</i>

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.795
Scared the hell out of me, too.
I thought I was hallucinating.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.433
In fact, I still am afraid I might be.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.832
See, they pumped me up
with something, and...

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.512
No, it's...

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.636
- It's all real.
- Oh.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.191
- How bad is the leg?
- Oh, they say I'm probably going to lose it.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.795
Hey, you know, I thought I was dead.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.953
I guess in the grand scheme of things,
I can't really complain that much.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.633
Excuse us.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.595
Jack?

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.031
Are there any more of you
I should know about?

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.352
No. Look, I understand how weird this is...

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.351
About four hours ago, one of our satellites

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.910
took the damnedest picture
you ever did see.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.275
How did you get here so fast?

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.597
I was already on my way up here
to supervise a training exercise on the ice,

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:23.708
and then I got orders to make a drop
to determine what caused this.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.790
Whatever that was is gone.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.310
- And you have no idea what this is?
- You're the astronaut, you tell me.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.994
The device that made
what you see in this picture,

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.389
an energy vortex created
prior to the establishment

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.517
of a stable wormhole, is called a stargate.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.989
Now, normally, we use it
to travel to other planets,

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.516
but this time we came through it
from an alternate timeline,

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.913
one where, amongst other things,
I'm not an astronaut.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.830
Yeah, that's pretty much
how I had it figured.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.275
Actually, she's telling the truth.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.913
And who are you?

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.679
Daniel Jackson.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.391
In the timeline where we come from,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.234
we've actually traveled
to several hundred planets together.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.153
- "We," as in you and...
- Yeah, in fact, in our timeline,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.596
I'm the closest thing you have
to a best friend.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.069
Yeah. Yeah, I'd buy that.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.358
- Okay, you're from Minnesota.
- Yeah.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.670
Eleven years ago,
your son accidentally shot himself

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.512
with a loaded 9mm
he found in your closet...

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.718
All right. Stop it, right there.
My kid is fine.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.268
He's at home, and he's fine!
What the hell's wrong with you?

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.069
Obviously, some things are different
in this timeline,

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.833
- but what you have to understand is...
- No, I don't!

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.391
I don't have to understand anything!
More importantly, I don't want to.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.833
As far as I'm concerned,
you people are nothing

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.115
but a pile of paperwork waiting to happen.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.430
- Jack, please...
- And stop that!

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.675
Jeez.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.912
You should at least warn your superiors
that this planet is in great danger.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.797
I'll get right on that.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.080
All right, they can have access
to food, water,

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.469
and any medical attention
they might need,

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.711
but they cannot go past this door
except to use the head.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.156
And nobody comes in or out
until we can surface, and

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.279
- deal with these freaks.
- Aye, sir.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.670
<i>Samantha Carter?
- Yes.</i>

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.910
It's common knowledge
that four years ago

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.958
<i>a computer failure forced
the space shuttle Intrepid's main engines</i>

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.076
to shut down
before it could reach a safe orbit

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.071
or a secondary landing site.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.559
When the autopilot also failed,

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.473
Mission Commander Samantha Carter
stayed behind to fly it,

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.949
while her crew bailed out
of the escape hatch.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.191
The orbiter went down over the Atlantic,
and her body was never recovered.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.236
- It wasn't me.
- You just said your name...

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.515
- I was recruited into the Stargate...
- Stargate Command is a branch...

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.556
...not NASA.
... of the United States Air Force.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.552
Founded in 1990-something,
I forget the exact year,

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.676
for the purposes of exploration and...

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.275
Actually, it was less an altered timeline
than it was this kind of multiverse thing...

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.713
It operates in secret
from a facility...

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.075
- I know what you're thinking, and...
- So we had the stargate powered...

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.879
...you're thinking I'm insane.
... and it was capable of operating, but

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.359
none of the random addresses we tried...

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.635
A list?
You want the whole list of every planet...

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.948
...and that's when I realized
- And so...

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.678
that the symbols
were actually constellations,

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.318
- and it was just a matter of determining...
- Okay. Earth.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.197
...which of the 39 symbols...
- You never forget your first.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.077
...represented the point of origin.
- And we discovered that

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.674
the symbols in a combination of seven
represented a gate address...

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.909
...known as Kassa,
it's kind of like space corn,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.195
but, you know, that is a story
you are going to want to hear sometime.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.635
- Why do you think this is funny?
- It was just a matter of figuring out...

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.109
- Everything I can think of, I have told you.
- Because it is funny,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.236
and you need to learn that things
can be both funny and true.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.197
Whereas I've been trying
to tell you Earth is in serious danger,

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.113
- you don't seem to give a rat's ass!
- Seriously, who would make this shit up?

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.875
Okay, fine! You say O'Neill wants nothing
to do with us? What about Landry?

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.996
If you would like to hear the answer
to that question,

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.513
- why don't you go ahead
- I know him...

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.794
- and play your tape back?
- Oh, my God,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.677
- for the umpteenth time...
- I'm gonna take a break.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.990
I want to talk to somebody else.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.634
I am agitated, because this is not the way

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.517
things are supposed to be.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.198
- Unfortunately, Colonel, it's the way it is.
- General, thank you for coming.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.748
You flew F-4s in Vietnam.
You have a daughter named Caroline.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.751
You're wild
about Fulvous Whistling-Ducks.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.950
Stop right there, son. I believe you.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.949
You do?

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.474
I've been listening to all three of you
for quite a while now.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.870
It's a hell of a story. The fact is...

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.470
Are the other two already in the hangar?
Good, we'll be right there.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.553
I can't stand having to repeat myself.
Follow me.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.840
Yeah, see, I knew that about him, too.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.471
- Hey, you guys. Having fun?
- Oh, joy.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.075
You've been at this for five straight days.
Eat something.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.269
It's not like you didn't feed us.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.518
Fine, I don't like to eat alone.
You should know that.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.556
Sir, you're probably wondering
why I requested

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.790
that you be brought all this way up
to meet with us.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.393
Actually, you all did.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.516
Something about the fact
that I'm the sort of man

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.318
who would understand.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.520
You'll have to forgive me.
I was at your memorial service

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.716
on the front lawn of the White House.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.351
I imagine you're an extraordinary person
in whatever timeline you happen to be in.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.553
- Sir, if you don't mind my asking...
- You don't exist.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.438
That is to say, there's no record
of a Colonel Cameron Mitchell

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.670
fitting your description
currently in the U.S. Air Force,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.637
or anywhere else, for that matter.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.598
And you, Dr. Jackson,
were last seen in Egypt,

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.353
attempting to find proof
that aliens once visited Earth

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.353
and that the pyramids are landing pads
for their spaceships.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.278
I take it that in your timeline,
that you're not a discredited whack-job

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.511
- living on the fringes of society.
- That really depends on who you ask.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.397
General, not that I need
to make this all about me...

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.072
There was one Mitchell of note

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.436
who served in the Merchant Marine
in the late '30s.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.071
<i>The captain of the ocean freighter Achilles.
That's how I know the name.</i>

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.709
Grandma had a picture of him
standing beside his ship in Boston Harbor.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.234
It's the one in my locker right now.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.277
Ba'al must've killed the crew
when he gated aboard.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.669
Wow.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.194
You're literally a grandfather paradox.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.157
That's what Dr. Lee said.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.357
Sir, I realize
that it may be extremely difficult,

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.750
if not impossible, to recover the stargate
from the bottom of the Arctic Ocean,

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.593
- but there is another one...
- The one in Antarctica, you mean?

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.148
I'm told we're sending a team
to check it out.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.676
We need to do more than check it out, sir.
We need to use it.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.193
We have to set things right.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.350
- How, exactly?
- I've been thinking about this.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.750
Now, Ba'al must have built
some sort of temporal device.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.478
- Time machine.
- Yes.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.199
Now, if we could use the stargate
to contact one of our allies, then we...

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.236
That will not be allowed to happen.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.356
Sir, I don't think you understand
exactly what will be lost

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.000
if we're not allowed to return things
to the way they're supposed to be.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.789
"Supposed to be" is relative, Dr. Jackson.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.474
The allies we've met,
the technologies we've acquired,

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.152
the hundreds of planets we've visited...

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.719
We can do all that,

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.837
assuming we can recover the stargate
in Antarctica,

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.275
and assuming it does
what you say it does.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.477
I'm sure we'll use the thing to go out
and explore the galaxy.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.028
There are a lot of excited people
around here.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.918
With respect, sir, you're missing the point.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.992
The timeline was altered
by one of our enemies.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.719
The System Lord, Ba'al.
You talked about him at some length.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.075
Because he's a very real threat.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.434
According to your own story,

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.354
it's been 70 years
since the timeline was changed.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.752
If all this is part of some plan,
where is he?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.433
Man has a point.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.317
Okay, if his plan was to take over Earth,

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.994
he would first have to reestablish a
power base with the other System Lords.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.513
Now, that wouldn't be easy.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.192
Now, if his plan died with him, then...

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.431
Or he's still in the process
of establishing his power,

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.748
and it's just a matter of time.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.558
This is as far as we're willing to go.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.234
In exchange for signing
a non-disclosure agreement,

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.276
you'll be given identities,

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:50.751
a place to live in different parts
of the country, for obvious reasons.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.354
And you better behave yourself in public,

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.830
<i>otherwise you'll end up on the front page
of The Enquirer.</i>

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.955
Sir, please don't do this.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.508
The decision has been made
at the highest level.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.592
I'm sure that, in time,
your advice will be welcome.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.240
If and when the Navy
gets this stargate up and running,

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.151
you can come aboard as consultants,

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.869
but you will never, ever, be allowed
to step through that thing.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.269
You're afraid we're going
to try and repair the timeline.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.157
Oh, you've made that intention
abundantly clear...

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.074
- Because we have a responsibility.
- But you don't have the right!

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.476
If you were to succeed,

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.030
events in the lives of thousands,
if not millions of people,

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.348
would never have happened!

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.793
My goodness, people,

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.078
the arrogance of what you're asking us
to help you do is mind-boggling!

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.674
Maybe if I wasn't woken
in the middle of the night

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.909
and flown to Alaska,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.992
I might be more like the kind,
sympathetic former general

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:58.234
you were hoping I'd be,
but trust me, if you lived in this timeline...

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.709
We'd want it to stay the way it is.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.236
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to go back to my wife

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.880
and my very pleasant retirement.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.679
And you all have new lives to begin.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.194
They're ready to board the aircraft!

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.394
It was a pleasure meeting all of you.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.589
Yeah.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.079
It truly was.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.515
At no time are you to make contact
by any means

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.149
with Mr. Jackson or Ms. Carter
without prior authorization.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.674
Any such attempt will be seen
as a breach of this agreement,

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.273
and you will be remanded in custody...

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.148
You will be provided a suitable
home, vehicle, and a living allowance,

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.676
which may be augmented without penalty
should you choose to seek employment

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.115
in any field other than the following:

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.751
<i>- Astrophysics, aerospace, engineering...
At no time may you discuss, write,</i>

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.513
<i>or otherwise communicate the matters
and/ or events</i>

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.192
<i>as stated in this agreement</i>

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.192
<i>with any person
other than your authorized contact.</i>

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.271
<i>Is that clear, Dr. Jackson?</i>

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.993
Dr. Jackson?

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.233
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.472
This is the place.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.353
I guess it is.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.833
- Do you need help getting out?
- No, I think I can handle it.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.313
Keep the change.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.188
How's it going, Cam?

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.070
Hey, Mrs... Heather. Heather.
Caught myself this time.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.152
- Finally.
- Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.959
So, when do we get to go for a ride?

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.156
Well, I'm going to take it
for a road-trip test drive,

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.754
so maybe when I get back.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.270
I'll hold you to that. Come on.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.271
Oh, damn, that's trouble.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.957
Can I help you, son?

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.874
Oh... I apologize for the intrusion.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.316
I spent some time here when I was a kid.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.072
What's the name?

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.913
Mitchell. Cam Mitchell.

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.630
I've lived here over 35 years.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.430
- Really? Who was here before that?
- Hendersons.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.438
Harry and Lorna.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.275
Oh, so you knew Harry?

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.549
Yeah.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.598
I was just a boy,
but they were nice people.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.595
Look, I know this is weird,
but do you mind if I go inside?

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.434
I have an image of the place
that I can't quite shake.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.715
Well, what the hell,
I'm not doing anything.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.949
Come on.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.232
Hello, Dr. Jackson?

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.592
Yes, I'm sorry I'm calling so late.
I'm calling from the States, and...

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.917
Well, I've stayed in that hotel myself
a number of times,

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.468
and I just thought that you might...

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.753
Well, because I wanted
to tell you something.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.592
That you're right.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.034
About everything, about the pyramids,

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.918
about what the glyphs said
about aliens visiting Earth.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.353
Everything.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.590
It doesn't matter who I am.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.830
Let's just say I'm someone
who believes in your work,

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.592
and you should, too.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.794
No, no, no, I do. I really do. I...

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.077
You have to have more faith
in yourself, Dr. Jackson.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.155
Hello?

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.594
Hello?

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.719
Put me through
to your commanding officer.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.950
Tell him it's Colonel Carter.
I need to speak to him now.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.349
Mr. Mitchell?

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.829
<i>This stunning footage
just in from our affiliate station...</i>

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.239
Son, you'll want to see this.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.198
<i>...alleged alien craft
pursued by an Air Force F-16</i>

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.919
<i>illustrates just how close they came
to both the White House</i>

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.878
<i>and several treasured national monuments
before climbing out of range</i>

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.279
<i>of the pursuing fighter.</i>

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.918
<i>We're hearing reports
of confirmed sightings</i>

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.195
<i>from all across Europe and Asia as well.</i>

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.395
<i>According to White House sources,</i>

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.516
<i>there has been no communication
from these vessels,</i>

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.989
<i>but neither have they taken
overtly hostile action.</i>

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.115
<i>The President has called for calm,</i>

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.430
<i>but we are told our armed forces
are on high alert.</i>

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.955
Hello?

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.675
Sam!

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.878
This is so great.
I was just thinking about you guys.

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.678
I thought by now they'd at least allow us
to see each other,

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.036
but every time I... No, I don't have a TV.
Why?

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.117
Bring in the prisoner.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.717
Well done, Teal'c.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.234
It is my honor to serve Lord Ba'al.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.600
Yes, it is. But generations from now,

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:01.514
they will speak of Master Teal'c of Chulak,
First Prime of Ba'al,

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.114
first leader of the free Jaffa nation.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.874
<i>Shol'va.</i>

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.918
Apophis,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.992
last of the System Lords
to stand against me.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.753
What have you to say
to your new sovereign?

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.400
May your reign last days

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.232
and your death, years.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.552
That's actually rather good, isn't it?

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.710
Did you plan to say that
when you walked in?

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.913
Or was it just off the top of your head?

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.190
My lord, Cronus hails us.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.393
Clean this up.

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.959
<i>Lord Ba 'al, the squadron
of Al'kesh</i>

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.112
<i>that you ordered to the Tau'ri
have reported.</i>

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.679
<i>It is as you promised.</i>

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.719
<i>They number in the billions,
and they are defenseless.</i>

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.869
Excellent.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.269
You may reveal the coordinates
to the rest of the fleet.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.032
We shall leave on my order.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.473
<i>As you wish.</i>

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.199
There is a god standing here
with wet hands.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.314
Teal'c, you may tell your warriors

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:50.313
that their dream of freedom
is one step closer.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.913
I shall, my lord.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.712
- Well?
- I am in awe of your accomplishment.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:04.518
You have predicted every move
of your enemies

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.592
and fulfilled every promise to your allies.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:14.028
Ra, Nirrti, Cronus, Zipacna,
all once-powerful System Lords, and now,

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.599
they all serve you.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.557
They serve us, my queen.

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.633
- I am truly privileged.
- I know.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.318
I can't help myself.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.113
<i>There is no nation on this earth</i>

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.039
<i>that does not share in our resolve
to defend our world.</i>

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.758
Until we give them something more
to talk about,

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.478
they're going to play this speech to death.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.552
What about the Russians or the Chinese?
Are they hearing anything?

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.108
There's been no response of any kind
from the alien craft, sir.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.112
We've tried every frequency there is.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.758
Why would they come all the way

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.195
from wherever the hell it is
they came from,

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:55.956
fly around with a bunch of F-16s
on their asses for half a day,

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.393
and then just sit there?

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.040
They're advance scout ships,
Mr. President.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.519
You asked that they be brought
to the command bunker

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.079
the moment they arrived, sir.

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.310
That's fine, Alex, thank you.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.991
Henry Hayes. Thanks for coming.
You were saying, Mr. Mitchell?

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.909
The ships in orbit are called Al'kesh.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.594
They serve both as scouts
and as ground-support bombers.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.671
And they're nothing
compared to what's coming next.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.954
Really?

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.315
- So, what's coming next?
- Death.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.594
Slavery.

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.556
More slavery, more death.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:31.794
Look, if you want to say, "I told you so,"
go ahead and get it off your chest,

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.793
but then you can do one of two things.
You can help, or you can leave.

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.235
- Okay, bye!
- Jackson.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.118
Right, I forgot to say, "I told you so. "

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.589
Now, are you going to help, or not?

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.832
Have you recovered the stargate?

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:48.309
We couldn't locate the one you sent down,

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.234
but we did manage to find the other one
in Antarctica. It's still there.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.514
Why didn't you bring it back?

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:57.673
Well, the Navy suggested, and I agreed,
what better place to build a facility

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.355
and start a testing program
in complete secrecy

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.953
than McMurdo base?

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.359
Why weren't we told?

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.439
You'd be surprised
at some of the stuff we do around here

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.590
without running it by you.

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.432
It isn't operational yet, is it?

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.080
Not yet, but we have our best scientists
working on it.

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.469
How quickly can you get us there?

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.959
Don't forget,
I'm the one who gave the order

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.474
to keep you away from that thing.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.636
Erasing the timeline is not an option.

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.712
Then why are we here?

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.676
When I was first briefed on you three,

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.639
I thought my Chief of Staff
was yanking my chain.

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.312
I didn't believe him
the second time, either.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.597
Finally, he had to bring in
the National Security Advisor

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.274
to convince me that he wasn't kidding.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:49.912
On page 2,000-and-something of the brief,
one of you, I can't remember which,

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.959
talks about how I handled
a similar invasion in your timeline

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:55.155
to the one that might happen here.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.277
Of course, in our case, you had the benefit
of an operational Stargate Program

00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.793
for about seven years.

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.996
Well, to be fair, it was actually
the Ancient weapons platform

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.798
in Antarctica that saved us.

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.029
Exactly.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.710
- Shouldn't it still be there?
- It's under a mile of ice.

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.429
The Army Corps of Engineers have been
drilling at the coordinates you gave us

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.033
for the last three months.

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.954
- We're not there yet, but we're close.
- Even so, its power source is depleted.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.190
We'd need a fully-charged
Zero Point Module.

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.349
Taonas.

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.839
There's no reason
it still shouldn't be there.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.399
We'd have to steal a cargo ship.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.357
Well, it's not like
we haven't done that before.

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.795
Once we recover the ZPM,
we can gate directly back to Earth,

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.950
because the stargate's already
in Antarctica.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.075
- We'll just need...
- Someone with a gene

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.435
that could operate the chair.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.239
If there's still time, sir, this can work.

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.992
That's the SG-1 I read about.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.038
If the control crystal's intact
and the power relay's in position,

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.112
I should be able to dial out the gate
in a couple of hours.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.713
General Hammond?

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.071
Sir, it's good to see you.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.593
If you say so.

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.352
There are four F-15s on the tarmac
at Andrews,

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:04.318
each carrying minimal armaments
and extra fuel tanks.

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.958
Once the stargate is operational,

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.271
you'll be escorted through
by a squad of four marines.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.952
That's not negotiable.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.234
To keep us on the mission.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.515
That's not necessary, sir,
but we'll take the back-up.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.158
Even if everything goes according to plan,

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.151
it's going to be a couple of days, at least,
till we get back.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.674
What are you going to do
if Ba'al shows up before then?

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.433
Is there anything we can do, Dr. Jackson?

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.871
- Well, I wouldn't mention us.
- Thought of that one.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.279
Good luck.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.752
To all of us, sir.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.071
There it is, my friends.

00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:59.911
This little world in the middle of nowhere,
lost and forgotten until now.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.558
Thanks to our Lord Ba'al,

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.871
it is ours to enslave and pillage
as we please.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.157
It is an abomination they have been
allowed to breed to such numbers.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.310
Their stargate has been buried
for centuries,

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:14.473
and was subsequently involved
in an unfortunate boating accident.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.192
Hence, they have been completely cut off
from us.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.271
They know nothing of the Goa'uld.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.999
Nevertheless, they are far too many
to control.

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.911
We'll just blast them
to the brink of extinction.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.991
That will not be necessary.

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.958
- But it would be enjoyable.
- I agree.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.600
You are all so stuck in your ways.

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.272
If we were to wipe them out
by the billions,

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.955
the survivors would despise us
for all eternity.

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.874
I know something of these people.
I have studied them for some time.

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:45.397
If we give them cause to fight,
they will fight to the bitter end,

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.790
but if we promise them a grand future,

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.555
if we offer them our loving kindness,

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.599
then I assure you, my friends,
they'll fall for it completely.

00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.955
As you have done with your Jaffa?

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.718
If by that you mean the Jaffa who,
with the promise of freedom,

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.588
managed to defeat the combined armies
of the System Lords,

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.749
yes.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.150
And that promise will be fulfilled.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.798
I'm sure it will.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.514
In fact...

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.839
- Teal'c.
- Yes, my lord.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.516
Camulus has kindly offered
one half of his domain, Australia,

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.113
to the free Jaffa nation.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.274
- I have said no such...
- Your generosity brings a god to tears.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.389
Now, let us be clear, my friends.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.833
The lands of the Tau'ri that you receive

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.309
and the many millions of humans
that inhabit them

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.719
are a gift.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.553
Be grateful,

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.719
or be silent.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.513
Return to your ships.
I shall contact the Tau'ri myself.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.238
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.271
- Teal'c.
- Yes, my lord.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.638
There is something
I want you to search for.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.428
Ships, sir. Dozens of them.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.398
They just popped up out of nowhere
a few minutes ago.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.839
Hyperspace.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.198
I read the brief.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.030
What's the status of SG-1?

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.918
They should be airborne in a few minutes.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.956
At this time, Mr. President,
it's my recommendation

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.474
we take our forces to DEFCON 2.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.675
Do it.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.353
- We should inform SG-1 that they're here.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.438
<i>Jackson, you may want
to strap in back there</i>

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.512
<i>and get some sleep.
Should be a long, boring ride.</i>

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.113
<i>Yeah, I hope so.</i>

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.398
Colonel Mitchell!

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.593
<i>We've just received a message
from Washington.</i>

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.035
<i>I'm told you'll understand.</i>

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.599
<i>"They're here. "</i>

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.318
What is that?

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.834
Something I've kept in stasis
a very long time,

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.480
so that one day I could place this call.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.428
What do you mean he's on the phone?

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.273
It came directly through
the White House switchboard.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.920
- From the spaceship? Ba'al?
- Lord Ba'al.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.672
His words, not mine.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.633
Yeah, right.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.595
Thank you, Alex. Hello?

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.633
Mr. President.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.190
I was beginning to think I wasn't going
to get through your gauntlet of minions.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.236
<i>Who is this?
Who am I speaking to?</i>

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.514
I am Ba'al.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.875
I assume by now you've detected
the presence of my fleet

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.188
in orbit over your planet?

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.354
As a matter of fact,
we have our eye on you.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.954
<i>Please forgive this primitive means
of communication,</i>

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.349
but if I were to land my ship
in your rose garden,

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.398
or appear as a hologram in your office,

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.597
what kind of race of beings
would you think we are?

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.516
I wanted to give you
my personal assurance

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.319
that we come in peace,
seeking nothing more than friendship.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.552
Well, we're glad to hear that down here.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.119
Then let me further assuage your concerns

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.111
by meeting you in person
in your Oval Office.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.434
I'm sure something can be arranged soon.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.110
I was thinking this afternoon.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.479
<i>It is the kind of thing
I can clear my schedule for.</i>

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.879
Excellent. Then perhaps we can get...

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.871
Put that down.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.988
Mr. President,
I'm afraid I'll have to get back to you later.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.992
He hung up on me.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.070
The edges of the Shikra blade
have been honed

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.798
to the thickness of a single atom.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.316
I must keep my hand very still,

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.995
for fear that one slip will cut you in half.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.118
Now, tell me, how can you possibly know
so much about this world?

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.432
- I told you, my sweet.
- You've been studying in secret.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.635
When?

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:36.111
You haven't allowed me to leave your side
in 50 years.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.436
Every time you have defeated
your enemies, you've been one step ahead,

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.555
and now you are as familiar
with their world

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.675
as if you have lived among them,

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.558
and you even have
one of their communication devices. How?

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.552
For a short time, I confess,
I did live among them.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.950
- When?
- Another life, another time.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:58.588
This world offers many pleasures, Qetesh.
Pleasures I intend to share with you.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.989
Not good enough.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.070
My lord, forgive the intrusion.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.790
Think nothing of it, Teal'c.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.792
I have the results of our search
of the southernmost continent.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.474
There is a Chappa'ai, as you predicted.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.555
Thank you, Teal'c. You may leave us now.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.552
However, my lord,
it is not lodged within a crevasse.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:33.518
The humans have moved it
to a small settlement and taken it inside.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.433
- It does not appear to be yet functional.
- What?

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.353
They have also drilled a shaft
deep inside the ice

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.953
elsewhere on the continent.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.314
Impossible.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.954
How could they have known?

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.554
Instruct the fleet
to bombard both locations

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.517
from space immediately.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.989
Is that your wish, my lord?

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.195
Do it,

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.551
and report back to me when it's done.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.478
Now, tell me,

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.474
my sweet.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.149
Is your plan going as well
as you expected?

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.469
<i>You realize Ba 'al is going to
figure out where we're headed</i>

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.597
<i>before we get
within 1,000 miles of McMurdo.</i>

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.436
<i>- He thinks we're dead, remember?
Oh, we have him now.</i>

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.119
Hail the fleet.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.360
This is Teal'c
aboard the Sovereign's flagship.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.509
Lord Ba'al has given the order

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.397
to destroy targets
at the following coordinates

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.152
near the planet's South Pole.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.516
Assign what vessels you see fit.
Fire when ready.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.113
I talked to Ba'al directly,
and despite his assurances,

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.435
I have reasons to distrust him.
Very good reasons.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.677
Yuri, I have to tell you about something
we're working on in the Antarctic

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.228
that might help us deal with them.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.914
It involves an artifact we found
a couple of months ago...

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.479
Mr. President?

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.039
Hold on a sec.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.554
- George, do you know who I'm talking to?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.313
A few minutes ago,
we lost contact with McMurdo.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.439
The first report was something
about brilliant flashes of light in the sky,

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.750
then explosions all over the compound.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:29.628
We also lost contact with the drilling site
above the Ancient weapons platform

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.438
at roughly the same time.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.193
We're trying to get satellite pictures
to confirm.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.511
So much for afternoon tea
in the rose garden.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.512
Yuri, that project in the Antarctic
I was telling you about?

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.999
It's going backwards.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.076
- My lord.
- Stay back, Teal'c.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.799
My lord, shall I enact
your final instructions?

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.711
No, you idiot, save me.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.110
- Try it, and I will kill him.
- You intend to kill him regardless.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:05.513
- No! There must be some arrangement.
- Actually, my love, he's right.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.319
Jaffa, treason!

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.154
<i>Sierra Golf One,
we're receiving an encoded message.</i>

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.434
<i>Stand by.</i>

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.835
<i>Message reads,
"McMurdo has been destroyed.</i>

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.152
<i>"Return to your previous position
and stand by for further instructions. "</i>

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.909
<i>- Understood.
- So much for that.</i>

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.592
<i>Well, what further instructions
can there be,</i>

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.511
<i>other than, "Kiss your ass goodbye"?</i>

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.160
<i>Oh, let's pull about turn and find out.</i>

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.433
- Master Teal'c.
- I am on a mission for the Sovereign.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.875
We will cloak the ship immediately
and await further orders.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.913
Hail Cronus.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.108
<i>My queen.</i>

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.238
Our Lord Ba'al has seen the light.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.835
He now wishes to blast the Tau'ri
into extinction.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.559
<i>You are most persuasive.</i>

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.799
We shall return in three days.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.518
The more of the planet
you have destroyed,

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.591
the more richly you shall be rewarded.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.910
And if you see Teal'c, kill him.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.997
<i>As the Sovereign wishes.</i>

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.070
Jaffa, set a course for Praxyon

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.993
and engage the hyperdrive
at maximum speed.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.513
Yes, my queen.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.591
This world is not enough.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.516
The Sovereign's flagship
is leaving the fleet.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.672
The Sovereign is dead,
betrayed by Qetesh.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.954
Our only hope of avenging him

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.758
is to arrive at the planet Praxyon
before she does,

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.638
and the only way to do that
is through a Chappa'ai.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.073
But you yourself ordered it destroyed.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.918
There is another.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.469
<i>Thanks for the top-up, boys.</i>

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.834
<i>Sierra Golf leader,</i>

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.310
<i>we're going to be right back
where we started...</i>

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.472
<i>Son of a bitch! Carter, break right!
Break right!</i>

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.438
<i>What city is that?</i>

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.434
<i>Washington.</i>

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.148
Listen to me,

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.074
because I don't think either one of us
has much time left.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.470
If you have anything,
any information that could help...

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.715
Yuri, I can't hear you! What?

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.714
You've also discovered an artifact?

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.918
Where is it located?

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.550
<i>We're receiving another encoded
message with new flight instructions.</i>

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.757
<i>Message reads,
"The Russians have the other one. "</i>

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.831
<i>- Hello.
- "Do what you need to do. "</i>

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.558
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:40.794
<i>Coordinates received. Stopping for gas.
I estimate ETA at 19:30 Zulu.</i>

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.916
<i>Let's do what we need to do.</i>

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.758
We're on emergency power, sir,
and all the elevator shafts have collapsed.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.877
We're not getting out of here
anytime soon.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.428
Do we have confirmation
that our message got through to SG-1?

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.714
Yes, sir.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.793
By now, they're well over
the North Atlantic.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.997
<i>That last KC-135 pilot was
a bit stingy.</i>

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.593
<i>Fuel's going to be close.</i>

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.593
<i>I have multiple contacts down range
approaching at Mach 3.5.</i>

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.115
<i>Gliders?
- Yeah, that's a good bet.</i>

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.112
<i>They're coming through at 80,000 feet.</i>

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.158
<i>Sierra Golf escort,
we must complete our mission.</i>

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.798
<i>- Do you understand?
Affirmative.</i>

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.429
<i>Sierra Golf One and Two,
proceed to target. We will engage.</i>

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.799
<i>Here they come.</i>

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.154
<i>Oh, yeah! Just go ahead
and fall asleep back there, Jackson.</i>

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.593
<i>It's going to be a long, dull ride!</i>

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.752
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.
How many on our six?</i>

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.549
<i>Too many!</i>

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.559
<i>We can't shake them at altitude.</i>

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.232
<i>We're going to have to go down
to the deck.</i>

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.390
<i>Yeah, we're right behind you.</i>

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.590
<i>I've got another contact,
six bogies, dead ahead, coming right at us.</i>

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.353
<i>Sorry, Sam, we're kind of busy right now.</i>

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.435
<i>I don't think they're gliders. They're MiGs!</i>

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.999
<i>Jackson, get on the radio!</i>

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.273
<i>What the hell did you just say?</i>

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.636
<i>"We're Americans.
Please shoot the people chasing us!"</i>

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.509
<i>We have
been expecting you! Good luck!</i>

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.192
<i>Yeah, back at you.</i>

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.831
<i>I can see the coast.</i>

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.593
<i>Sierra, rejoin,
we're going to head on down.</i>

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:15.908
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.599
This is not encouraging.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:49.909
Where is everybody?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.752
At home with their families,
where I should be.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.831
I need to speak to the lead scientist
on this project.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.388
He is not here.
None of them have been here for weeks.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.278
- Really?
- We had no idea of purpose of artifact.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.909
We named it Anchor,
because it was found on bottom of ocean.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.433
Are there any grown-ups around
that we could talk to?

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.712
Boys, we need power.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.077
What you see now is emergency batteries.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.038
We lost main power to facility
over three hours ago.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.680
Oh, okay, we understand that,
but we've come a very, very long way

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.398
to use this device.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.948
I cannot give you what I do not have.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.511
- What was that?
- It sounds like a ship. Al'kesh?

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.554
And it's landing on the roof. Just great.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.076
- We must get out of here.
- Hey, your weapon.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.913
- Hands up.
- Don't.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.795
Teal'c?

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.437
How do you know my name?

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.635
I can do better than that.
You're from Chulak,

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.676
your best friend goes
by the name of Bra'tac,

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.069
and you're the First Prime of...

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.912
Jackson, whose mark is that?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.319
Ba'al.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.118
What did he promise to win you over?

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.792
The freedom of my people.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.552
I'll give him credit
for knowing which button to push.

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.438
Ba'al is dead. Slain by his queen.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.829
Oh, don't tell us, Qetesh.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.235
Indeed.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.799
Why?

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.269
That is none of your concern.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.511
Allow us passage through the Chappa'ai,
and your lives may be spared.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.398
Or you tell us what you're up to,
and your lives will be spared.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.391
My only concern is my mission.

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.198
Which is?

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:02.831
To avenge Ba'al's death.
The final task of a First Prime.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.119
- Indeed.
- Well, that sounds great.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.077
- We'll help out, right, guys?
- Sure, why not?

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.388
- I'm not busy.
- Let's do it.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.789
I do not require your assistance.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.192
My ship has been detected.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.919
Its shields have been extended
to protect this building and the Chappa'ai,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.551
- but it will not hold for long.
- What do you say we all get out of here?

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.429
We can all die here when that shield fails,
or we can go through the gate together

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.715
and continue this discussion
on the other side.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.279
It's up to you.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.348
This device will power the Chappa'ai.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.636
I like that. No hesitation.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.032
Let's go! Go!

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.475
Give me a reason I should not kill you
where you stand.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.951
Because you're a good man.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.194
Because

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.630
somewhere, deep down, you realize
we're supposed to be on the same side.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.917
Because we can offer you
the freedom of your people.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.158
Really?

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.198
This is Ba'al's failsafe. It has to be.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:14.113
I think this whole place
is his time machine.

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.313
Teal'c, you have to understand,
in the timeline we just came from,

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.834
the Goa'uld are defeated
and the Jaffa are free.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:42.708
Now, Ba'al used a machine
to go back in time and change all of that.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.836
He made you his First Prime
and Qetesh his queen

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.831
so he could control you.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.268
This is the secret
for which Ba'al was murdered.

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.998
So that's why you think
Qetesh is on her way here?

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.275
She wants to use this device for herself.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.319
- That cannot be allowed to happen.
- See? We agree about everything.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.319
Teal'c, if you let us use this device,

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:04.551
we can return history
to the way it was meant to be.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.471
The Goa'uld will be gone?

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:11.513
- My people will be free?
- You have our word.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.157
Let it be done.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.118
It'll just take me a few minutes
to figure out exactly how it works.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.316
That may be all the time we have.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.630
By my reckoning,
Qetesh will be here at any moment.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.073
Thank you.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.630
Well, you heard the man.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.198
There must be satellites
orbiting every one of these stars.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.759
There's hundreds of them,

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.230
each sending real-time telemetry
back to this computer through subspace.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.278
Exactly how does that add up
to a time machine?

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.719
They're looking for something specific.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.914
Solar flares.
Exactly.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.639
Until now, other than Ancient technology,
the only way we know

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.312
of traveling backward
and forward through time

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.469
is to pass through a wormhole

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.199
as it intersects the magnetic field
of a solar flare.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.998
Now, with enough satellites
and enough computing...

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.389
Yeah, that's brilliant.
Which button do we press?

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:16.233
Yeah, I think it's a little more complicated
than that.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.594
Actually, not much.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:19.557
We just need to choose a time and place

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.108
sometime before Ba'al can put his plan
into motion.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.633
They are here.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.475
Sam.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.232
Well, if you want to go back
to the Cretaceous period,

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.675
we can go right now,
otherwise we have to wait for a flare

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:34.151
capable of sending us back to a time
and place that's a little more useful.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.395
Sam!

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.073
I've found one,
but you're not going to like it!

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.232
- Why not?
- It'll send us back to 1929.

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.231
That's 10 years too soon!

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:33.316
Well, it'll have to do,
because I'm just about out of...

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:53.309
Once I dial the stargate,

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.516
we'll have less than 20 seconds
to get through!

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.114
Dial it up and get your ass down here!

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.949
Carter!

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.189
Teal'c!

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:21.955
Jaffa!

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:57.989
Teal'c.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.554
You are the most

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.314
stubborn Jaffa I have ever known.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.639
Perhaps

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.988
I shall choose you as my First Prime

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.314
after all.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.315
I...

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.592
Think not, Qetesh.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.354
I die...

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.989
Free.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.229
Make your course
three-five-zero.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.470
Three-five-zero. Aye, Captain.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.475
We'd be in Boston by now

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:22.154
if we weren't zigzagging
all over the bloody Atlantic.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.196
You'd rather make it easy for the U-boats?

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.952
We're not at war yet.

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.590
Check to see the cargo's secure.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:37.319
You're never going to tell me
what it is, are you?

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.072
If I knew myself...

01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:58.709
Captain.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.153
We're about to be boarded.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.117
- Boarded?
- Get over there.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.996
- How?
- Don't shoot until I do.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.954
Back up.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.558
Who are you?

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.996
You might say I'm a friend of the family.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.718
What happened here?

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.598
Well, that could take a while to explain.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.116
Begin the extraction process.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.435
Behold!

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:22.270
The last of the System Lords.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.919
- I guess that was worth seeing.
- What?

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.913
That's all you have to say?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.070
Well, you guys made it out
like it was this big deal.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.199
- I expected something more spectacular.
- Nope.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:51.556
That's pretty much
the extraction ceremony, right there.

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.434
Yup. Right.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.116
So, lunch, anyone?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.355
- I'm buying.
- I'm in.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.317
Actually, sir, I was hoping
that we could go over the plans

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.676
- for the new moon base.
- What moon base?

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:15.030
You know, I think I might stay awhile
and help him through this.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.712
- Yeah, I thought you might. Have fun.
- Thanks.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.197
He's in for an interesting afternoon.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.509
Indeed.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.115
What do you think Ba'al was talking about

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.192
when he said,
"You've all made a terrible mistake?"

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.590
- We shall never know.
- I know I ain't going to worry about it.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.672
I was just thinking,
what if he really wasn't the last one?

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.751
- He was the last one.
- As far as we know.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.515
Yeah, as far as we know,
but you can't obsess about this stuff.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.273
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- I know I am. Come on, let's go.

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.078
When was the last time
General O'Neill bought lunch?

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.434
Good point.
