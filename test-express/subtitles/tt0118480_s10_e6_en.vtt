00:00:00.292 --> 00:00:01.251
<i>Previously...</i>

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:02.920
<i>on Stargate SG-1...</i>

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.422
I'm not just interested in outer space.

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.550
I'm from outer space.

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:13.388
<i>Four excellent heroes</i>
<i>in an extraordinary new sci-fi series,</i>

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:17.059
<i>starring Nick Marlowe as the wry Colonel Danning.</i>

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:20.562
As a matter of fact,
it does say "Colonel" on my uniform.

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:22.856
<i>Wormhole Extreme!</i>

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:24.608
It's what I do.

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.361
<i>He sold the idea to the studio.</i>

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.531
He obviously got the whole thing from
his knowledge of the Stargate Program.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:33.825
If the Air Force didn't want it to happen,
they wouldn't have let it go this far.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.579
Come on out.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.875
<i>We are the Furlings.</i>

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.670
We thought we'd never get to meet you.

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.846
We led them straight here.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.225
<i>Sam!</i>

00:00:58.267 --> 00:00:59.643
I thought I could make it work.

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:03.063
The thermodynamic loop
is feeding back into the planet's core.

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:13.198
<i>Well, that never happened.</i>

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.449
<i>Well, you've got to open big,</i>

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.911
catch people's attention, make them think
the whole thing is going to be jam-packed.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.371
I love jam!

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:25.961
Oh, I get it. It's yet another playful twist
on words in your "Earth" language.

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:28.630
It makes us look stupid.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.924
<i>You realize it's not actually us.</i>

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.760
Okay, okay, it makes the characters look stupid.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:37.014
I mean, do you really think the best way
to introduce the heroes of the story

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.433
is to show them causing a massive catastrophe?

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.268
That's... realistic.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.477
I don't care.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.812
Come on. It would be fun.

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:45.564
<i>You know, you say that about everything.</i>

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.733
Come to think of it, why am I doing this?

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.903
To make sure that the Air Force
is being properly represented,

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:56.158
and because General O'Neill
has requested you specifically.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.035
Of course he did.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:02.080
Jackson, how often do we get to give notes
on a big Hollywood feature script?

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.541
I believe this is intended to be a television movie.

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:07.961
A fictionalized, albeit slightly ridiculous version

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:12.799
of Stargate Command is an excellent cover
for the real thing in the event of a security leak.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.009
Plausible deniability.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:16.220
I'm sorry, Sir, did you say "slightly" ridiculous?

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.387
<i>You're doing this.</i>

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:18.847
<i>You have no choice.</i>

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:23.602
Just give the man five minutes.
I'll get you out of this when the time comes.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.359
I've been looking through this,
and there doesn't seem to be any mention of...

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.611
a sexy female alien...

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:34.238
Anywhere.

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:36.323
I'm not even in this!

00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:38.200
<i>You know, the really unbelievable part</i>

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:41.787
is that anyone would consider spending
millions of dollars on this thing.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.374
I mean, seriously, all these writers,
and they couldn't come up with anything better?

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:50.337
I don't know, I've been watching a lot of
television lately, and apart from one glaring omission,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.922
it doesn't seem to be that bad.

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:54.800
Maybe... we can make it better.

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:56.260
No, I'm with Sam on this one. I mean, who...

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.804
who makes a movie out of a series
that only lasted three episodes?

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:01.640
It allegedly performed well on DVD.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.185
No, I'm not using any shots from the series.

00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:08.146
It's a movie, not a clip show.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.065
<i>The budget is the budget.</i>

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:13.610
<i>They are a bunch of pencil-pushing,</i>
<i>bean-counting idiots.</i>

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:15.946
You tell them if they don't like it,

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:18.574
I'm going to take it somewhere else.

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:23.370
You know not to say that last part, right?

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.250
Yeah, movie, not clip show, is fine.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.919
Yeah, I've got to go.

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:32.629
Yeah.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:37.801
Cell coverage is just terrible in here.

00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:40.179
How's it going? You done?

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.309
<i>Well, it...</i>

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.021
certainly seems to be packed full of jam.

00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:51.899
I knew I should have given you my first draft.

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:54.985
The producer brought in the other writers.

00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:56.403
I thought you were the producer.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.779
Yeah, the real one.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.866
Look, just be honest.

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:03.702
I trust you guys. That's why I'm here.

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:05.954
Just tell me what you think.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.377
<i>Come on, you must have some ideas.</i>

00:04:12.503 --> 00:04:17.216
Don't be afraid. Just pitch them out.
We call it "spinning"!

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.760
Don't worry. No one's going to judge you.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.138
Okay, for starters,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.141
I think you need a strong opening title sequence.

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.518
Are you serious?

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.061
No one does that anymore.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.313
You just throw up the title and get on with it.

Season 10
200th Episode

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.178
Walter! Dial 447!

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:07.349
The only way to stop this is
to get the device back to the planet.

00:05:22.698 --> 00:05:25.993
Look, no offense, but...

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.954
Zombies have been done to death.

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:31.957
No... pun intended.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:35.043
<i>Besides, this is science-fiction, not horror.</i>

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.714
Did I mention the Tel'Chak device?
'Cause that's what turned them into zombies.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.007
Oh, sorry.

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:41.633
<i>Go for Marty.</i>

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.053
Oh, hey, Charlie. What's up?

00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:46.930
It's the studio.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.183
<i>What kind of problem?</i>

00:05:49.308 --> 00:05:54.271
Just out of curiosity, what was the rest of the team
doing while your character was fighting the zombies?

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:01.236
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:03.488
Studio executives...?

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.741
What? Oh, no, Charlie...

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.075
He's a great guy.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.744
He's the only one I trust.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.205
So, what's the problem, then?

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.915
Our lead backed out.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:16.126
How am I supposed to tell a story
without my lead character?

00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:19.087
Easy. You just bring in a character to replace him.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:24.635
What?

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:26.678
<i>You guys have to help me.</i>

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:30.599
<i>I mean, how can I keep the main character in the story</i>

00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:34.353
without actually having the actor who plays him?

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:38.148
Well, you could have the other characters
refer to him all the time,

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:40.567
maybe get him on the phone once in a while.

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:44.780
Oh, yeah, right. I mean something cool, like...

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.243
<i>Face-switching or... body-swapping?</i>

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.328
As if anyone would believe that.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:56.583
Come on, you guys must have some
real-life experiences I can draw on.

00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:00.712
Oh, well, there was that time
that Colonel O'Neill was invisible.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.632
<i>So, essentially what I think happened</i>

00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:08.053
is that you were bombarded by the particle field
being emanated by the cloaking generator.

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:12.349
See, you were in the engine room standing right
next to it when the device was turned on.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:16.395
That would account for the minor traces
of radiation we've been picking up from you. But...

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:17.479
the good news is

00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:19.940
I think I've found a way to reverse the process.

00:07:19.982 --> 00:07:22.985
We have to go back to the mothership
and get the cloaking generator.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.403
Sam, who are you talking to?

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:28.073
Oh, Colonel O'Neill. I was just explaining to him
how we're going to make him visible again.

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:29.241
No, you're not.

00:07:30.576 --> 00:07:31.827
Jack's in...

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.579
Hammond's office.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.455
I can't believe he did that to me again.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:36.832
Yeah.
You know, getting that

00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:41.336
cloaking generator off that mothership that's gonna be
the least of our problems. Now, getting Jack to help...

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.172
that's going to be the hard part.

00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:45.632
- Oh, don't tell me...
- Oh, yes.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.634
He likes being invisible.

00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:01.064
<i>And so, by translating this tablet,</i>

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.236
we should be able to determine
the most important thing in the universe.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:17.080
Does everyone just want to poke around,

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:18.999
see if you can find him?

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.043
Sir...

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.794
are you there?

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:27.591
<i>Nope.</i>

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.595
You cannot remain this way, O'Neill.

00:08:31.637 --> 00:08:32.638
<i>Why not?</i>

00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:35.807
<i>It gives us an advantage over the Goa'uld.</i>

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:39.770
<i>I can sneak around all I want totally undetected.</i>

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.063
<i>I...</i>

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.941
<i>give us the element of surprise.</i>

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.609
<i>The bottom line is</i>

00:08:46.068 --> 00:08:48.028
<i>I can do more for this planet,</i>

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.324
<i>invisible than I ever could</i>
<i>as my own sweet salient self.</i>

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.413
I assume I am staring at you stoically.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.709
<i>- Not buying it...?</i>
- No.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.295
You are most transparent, O'Neill.

00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:08.715
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.384
<i>Good one.</i>

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.261
I can see right through you.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.096
<i>Don't push it.</i>

00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:40.747
<i>Hello?</i>

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.207
<i>Hand signals.</i>

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.501
<i>I'm waving you over.</i>

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:51.341
Okay, I've made the necessary adjustments.
All I have to do now is initiate the sequence.

00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:53.135
<i>Okay.</i>

00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:54.970
<i>Let's do it.</i>

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.145
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:04.813
<i>This is better.</i>

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:08.734
It might feel like kind of a cheat.

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:13.197
Maybe it's best just not to mention the guy at all.

00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:18.619
Yeah... besides, invisibility can be very powerful.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.163
You might not want to open that can of worms.

00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:24.166
You don't want your heroes to become too powerful.

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:27.419
Well, you could always invent
some negative side-effects.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:31.256
That's how we talked
Colonel O'Neill into becoming visible again.

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:34.676
Okay, that's it.
SG-1, you are cleared to leave.

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:35.511
Thank you.

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.804
They can't leave!
They haven't finished reading my script!

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.641
That's funny,
I thought it said "General" on my uniform.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.768
- We owe you one, Sir.
- You mean another one.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.979
What are you talking about?
I thought you said it was gonna be fun.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.190
Not after his zombie idea got shot down.

00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:50.526
So, where are you guys all off to?

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.070
Some place pretty important...?

00:10:53.362 --> 00:10:55.364
It's just a recon mission, isn't it?

00:10:55.405 --> 00:11:00.619
Just a recon mission? This is no simple recon mission.
This is no less than my 200th trip through the Gate.

00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:01.578
Really?

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.121
- You're counting?
- You bet.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.291
I have been reflecting while changing into our gear...

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:09.503
I believe this is far from your 200th mission,
Colonel Mitchell.

00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:13.882
I didn't say 200th mission.
I said 200th trip through the Gate. That's counting...

00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:17.761
off-world Gates, back and forth,
pretty much any time I crossed the event horizon.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:21.056
Yeah...
this is gonna be huge...

00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:23.141
the big 2-0-0.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.322
Fix it.

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.115
Quickly.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.074
I'm on it.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.076
Indeed.

00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:50.794
We've got to go! We've got 10 seconds
before the time dilation field is activated.

00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:53.630
If we don't make it through the Gate,
we'll be stuck here forever!

00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:00.304
Okay, this could be a problem.

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.056
That was close...?

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:04.308
Oh yeah.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:05.767
<i>Are you serious?</i>

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:06.643
<i>What?</i>

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.187
How did we escape?

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.563
They.

00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:12.566
Fine, they. They, they, they.
How did they escape?

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:14.860
Isn't it obvious?

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:17.446
Even if the valley wasn't filled with Jaffa,

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:20.407
we could never have made it
to the Gate and dialed out in under...

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:21.742
10 seconds.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:22.201
Good.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.119
See, that's why we're here.

00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:25.162
So, what do you think?

00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:26.413
30 seconds?

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:29.082
<i>May... maybe not such a round number.</i>

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.083
How about...

00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:31.710
Thirty eight?

00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:36.131
What difference does it make?
I mean, it's not like you're gonna have
an actual ticking clock on the screen.

00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:37.674
That's brilliant!

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:39.134
That's ridiculous.

00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:40.052
<i>Trust me.</i>

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.096
Jeopardy plus ticking clock is box office.

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.849
It's the e = mc2 of the entertainment world.

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:47.392
<i>Ask any executive.</i>

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.979
Except I think
you've replaced jeopardy with certain death.

00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:51.855
Oh, come on,

00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:55.484
you guys have escaped
situations more dire than this before.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:56.985
He has a point.

00:12:57.027 --> 00:13:00.155
- So show the actual escape.
<i>- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:04.326
You can't give away too much too early.
It'll step on the ending.

00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:06.787
<i>Maybe if my character doesn't say,</i>

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:09.164
"this is a problem."
He could say something like,

00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:12.459
- "this should be easy."
- How many times do I have to tell you?

00:13:12.543 --> 00:13:13.961
It's not you.

00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:15.420
<i>Colonel Danning...</i>

00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:17.422
<i>is based on Colonel O'Neill.</i>

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:23.720
Please tell me you have the Gate working again.

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:26.306
We're running another diagnostic,
but right now, we're stumped.

00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:30.435
The power's getting through to the capacitors,
but for some reason, the charge isn't holding.

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:33.605
That's causing the control crystal
to send feedback into the interface

00:13:33.647 --> 00:13:36.859
and reset the programming code
of the base computer's dialing protocol.

00:13:38.694 --> 00:13:39.903
<i>That was awesome.</i>

00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:41.196
Say that again.

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.073
No.

00:13:45.409 --> 00:13:49.246
Everybody, take five.
I've got to get that down before I forget it.

00:13:49.288 --> 00:13:51.832
<i>The power getting to the flux capacitor, but</i>

00:13:51.874 --> 00:13:56.587
<i>feedback is not feeding back into the feedback face.</i>
<i>This is gold!</i>

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:57.254
Hey.

00:13:58.714 --> 00:14:00.174
Forget about the techno-talk.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.925
No one's really interested in it.

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:05.387
- You're an alien, right?
- Exactly,

00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:07.181
and I know just what this movie needs.

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:11.727
So how would you know what sci-fi fans
from Earth would be interested in?

00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:13.896
Aren't you also an alien?

00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:16.690
Yeah, but I've been here quite a while.

00:14:16.732 --> 00:14:17.691
Right. Look,

00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:20.485
I think I know a good story when I hear one.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.447
Don't you want this movie to appeal
to a broad range of people?

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:24.698
From Earth.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:30.913
I have all kinds of fabulous adventures,
none of which have been classified by the Air Force.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.166
Okay, shoot. Give me your best one.

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:34.791
Right.

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.544
I was in a stolen cargo ship on my way home

00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:42.299
<i>when a solar flare from a nearby star wreaked havoc</i>
<i>with my navigation system, and I was forced</i>

00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:44.176
to crash-land on the nearest planet.

00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:45.802
In a bizarre twist of fate,

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:49.223
<i>I crashed right on top of</i>
<i>the Goa'uld who ruled that planet,</i>

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:53.310
<i>which was fortunate because my ship was too badly</i>
<i>damaged to repair, and I needed help.</i>

00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:56.563
<i>The local villagers were very grateful.</i>

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:03.028
<i>They introduced me to a lovely fair-haired Tok'ra</i>
<i>who had been hiding out on the planet.</i>

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.866
<i>She told me the legend of a powerful ascended being</i>
<i>who supposedly lived in some distant,</i>

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:11.662
<i>- far-off mountains through a treacherous forest.</i>
<i>- Look, I don't have all day.</i>

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:13.330
- Cut to the chase.
- All right,

00:15:13.372 --> 00:15:18.043
I met up with a number of my friends along the way,
and after a dangerous and eventful journey,

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:21.547
we finally come face to face with the ascended being.

00:15:21.797 --> 00:15:24.007
What can I do for you?

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:27.219
Well, at first I thought I just wanted to go home but

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:30.138
now I've decided I'd quite like
to be a part of something...

00:15:30.848 --> 00:15:34.101
a regular part, if you catch my drift.

00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:38.647
Oh, and... these guys have their own issues. Boys?

00:15:49.408 --> 00:15:51.827
That's the Wizard of Oz.

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:55.581
You've seen that one?

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:56.999
Yeah.

00:15:57.124 --> 00:15:59.168
Oh, that's my phone.

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:00.711
Martin Lloyd.

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.212
I didn't hear it ring.

00:16:02.254 --> 00:16:04.006
It's on... vibrate.

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.591
<i>Yes, go ahead.</i>

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.342
I can sing.

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:12.055
So how's it going?

00:16:12.264 --> 00:16:13.557
Not well.

00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:15.684
Samantha, 200 is waiting.

00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:19.354
Right now, I'm just hoping we haven't done
something to permanently damage the Gate.

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:23.650
How can something work perfectly fine for 10 years,
then all of a sudden it doesn't work anymore?

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:25.068
I don't know.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.695
Okay, try it now.

00:16:29.615 --> 00:16:32.701
We're getting some strange
power readings here, Colonel.

00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:34.369
Shut it down.

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:37.164
It's not responding.

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:40.167
The Gate's drawing massive amounts of energy
into its capacitors.

00:16:40.209 --> 00:16:42.294
Close the blast door and the iris.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.721
I can't shut it down.

00:16:53.222 --> 00:16:55.516
Siler, manually cut the power!

00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:09.613
Why does this always happen to me?

00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:12.366
Sir, we have to evacuate the base!

00:17:13.242 --> 00:17:16.745
This is General Landry.
I'm declaring a code red emergency.

00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:19.456
All personnel, evacuate the base immediately.

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:22.709
Sir, the capacitors are overloading.
We have to get out of here now.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:23.585
Hurry.

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:34.596
And that is the end of act two.

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.017
The mountain blows up?

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.061
No possible hope for survival.

00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:41.895
Cool...?

00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:44.648
I just wrote it,
based on what's going on with the Gate.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.442
I love it when art imitates life.

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:48.527
Hang on...

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:50.863
we're alive in the next scene.

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:53.198
Oh, I just haven't fixed that part yet.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.953
I'm thinking I can back-sell it and say
you were beamed out at the last second.

00:17:57.995 --> 00:17:59.079
<i>Beamed out?</i>

00:17:59.121 --> 00:18:00.330
Sure. Why not?

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:02.207
Is that not too convenient?

00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:03.959
Not if you hang a lantern on it.

00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:04.793
What's that?

00:18:04.835 --> 00:18:06.211
It's a writer's term.

00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:10.174
Another character points out how convenient it is.

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.092
<i>Dr. Levant can say,</i>

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.553
<i>"Wow, that was great timing."</i>

00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:20.767
That way, the audience knows
I intended for it to be convenient, and we move on.

00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:22.394
Really.

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.229
Okay, where were we?

00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:25.898
Scene 24.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:26.815
<i>Oh, great,</i>

00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:28.609
one of my favorite scenes.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.027
Go ahead.

00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:35.741
Interior, bridge.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.452
<i>The crew mans their stations...</i>

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.954
I'm picking up a strange energy anomaly, Colonel.

00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:43.040
It appears the singularity is about to explode.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.333
Weapons are at maximum.

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:46.418
Dammit, Captain! Solar flare.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.378
We've got a shock wave heading straight for us.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.256
Can you reverse the... polarity?

00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:52.674
I'll do my best.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:54.801
Engine room...

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.512
warp speed!

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:57.846
<i>Take us out of here...</i>

00:18:57.888 --> 00:18:59.014
<i>now.</i>

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:04.436
I'm giving it all I've got, Captain,
but you're expecting a bloody miracle.

00:19:04.478 --> 00:19:05.395
<i>Hang on, hang on.</i>

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:06.188
What?

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.397
Okay, one...

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.650
that's Star Trek. And two...

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.109
it's ridiculous.

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.528
What's wrong with it?

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:15.155
"The singularity is about to explode?"

00:19:15.197 --> 00:19:16.240
Yes.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.367
Everything about that statement is wrong.

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:21.703
How exactly is having weapons at maximum
going to help the situation?

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:24.081
The audience isn't gonna know the difference.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:27.543
They love "weapons at maximum."

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:31.755
Never underestimate your audience.
They're generally sensitive, intelligent people

00:19:31.797 --> 00:19:34.716
who respond positively to quality entertainment.

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:38.679
<i>I do not understand why everything in this script</i>
must inevitably explode.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:45.269
<i>Look, you guys may all know how things really work</i>
out there in the galaxy, but I know the film business.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.188
Explosions make great trailers.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.731
<i>Simple fact.</i>

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:51.149
<i>More explosions,</i>

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:52.401
<i>better trailer.</i>

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:53.485
<i>Better trailer,</i>

00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:55.654
more viewers.

00:19:59.408 --> 00:20:01.410
Yeah, go for Marty.

00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:03.996
Oh, hey, Nora.

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:05.581
<i>What?</i>

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.000
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:10.169
<i>Tell them to stop panicking.</i>

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.753
<i>We're gonna sign him.</i>

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:12.838
<i>Don't worry.</i>

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.048
<i>I already put in a call in to his manager.</i>

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.134
<i>We'll get back to you.</i>

00:20:17.301 --> 00:20:18.886
Yeah. Bye.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.306
So... trouble with Nora.

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:23.974
<i>No. Nora...</i>
<i>she's great.</i>

00:20:24.016 --> 00:20:26.894
But since Nick Marlowe is holding out,

00:20:26.977 --> 00:20:31.148
one of the new junior executives
at the network has suggested

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.819
we re-cast the whole movie with
younger, edgier versions of the team.

00:20:35.861 --> 00:20:37.696
Can you imagine that?

00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:50.918
Yo, dawg,
what'd you do that for?

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.378
Dude, that hot chick was
so totally a Goa'uld!

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.255
Duh. I was still gonna tap that.

00:20:55.297 --> 00:20:57.049
You don't appreciate me, do you?

00:20:57.299 --> 00:21:00.010
I think you're so totally awesome.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.765
That's what I'm talkin' about.

00:21:07.184 --> 00:21:10.854
Yo, wonderbread,
you got that address figured out yet?

00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:13.023
Chill, T.

00:21:13.065 --> 00:21:16.109
I'm, like,
translating as fast as I can.

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:19.905
I'm so sick of being treated like some
sort of object to be worshiped.

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:22.032
I'm a real person with real feelings.

00:21:22.074 --> 00:21:23.033
You know,

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.995
I don't think Mitchell likes me anymore.

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.622
I'm pregnant.

00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:31.875
No.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.377
Nope.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:37.714
I need a latte.

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:40.634
How about this one?

00:21:40.676 --> 00:21:44.388
We were in a cloaked cargo ship on a simple,
three-hour reconnaissance mission...

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.265
Gilligan's island, right?

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.851
You got that from
"three-hour reconnaissance mission"?

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:49.977
Piece of advice...

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.520
if you're gonna rip something off,

00:21:51.562 --> 00:21:53.814
think of something a little more obscure.

00:21:53.856 --> 00:21:55.023
Oh, okay.

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:56.900
Call me fahrbot,

00:21:57.109 --> 00:21:59.319
but they gonna have our mivonks
on a platter if we don't...

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.321
starburst the draz out of here.

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:03.615
The cluster's been damaged,
we're not going anywhere.

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:07.411
Oh, dren.

00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:08.996
Hezmana!

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:12.291
Frell!

00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:15.085
Son of a hazmot!

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:16.962
Yotz!

00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:20.883
Okay, you got me.

00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:23.594
I have no idea what that is.

00:22:24.136 --> 00:22:27.097
Oh, for crying out loud,
what now?

00:22:28.182 --> 00:22:30.517
Oh, give me a break!

00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:35.397
I just a got a text message from the studio.

00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:38.901
The foreign distributor went bankrupt.
They're slashing my budget.

00:22:39.026 --> 00:22:40.527
In a text message?

00:22:40.569 --> 00:22:43.447
This totally screws up the end of act three.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.365
What happens at the end of act three?

00:22:45.449 --> 00:22:47.367
With these cuts, not much.

00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:49.077
Act three just ends.

00:22:51.496 --> 00:22:52.915
What's so bad about this?

00:22:52.956 --> 00:22:54.875
Any idea when we'll be able to go?

00:22:54.917 --> 00:22:56.168
Sorry.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.921
We're trying a full reset of the system, Sir.

00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:05.219
If you want this to be more accurate,

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.970
why don't you just give him your mission files?

00:23:07.012 --> 00:23:08.096
They're classified.

00:23:08.138 --> 00:23:11.683
So? Didn't you say that no one on your planet
would believe this was all real anyway?

00:23:11.725 --> 00:23:14.394
Even still, do you know how many
mission files there are?

00:23:14.478 --> 00:23:16.813
<i>1,263,</i>

00:23:17.272 --> 00:23:19.316
hopefully 64 by the end of the day.

00:23:19.358 --> 00:23:22.236
Actually, it's 1,264 already.

00:23:22.277 --> 00:23:25.739
No, it's 63, pretty sure.
I've read all the files recently.

00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:28.784
Actually, you haven't read 30185.

00:23:29.535 --> 00:23:31.703
30185?

00:23:32.663 --> 00:23:33.580
What's that?

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:35.582
We can't tell you.

00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:38.210
What do you mean you can't tell me?

00:23:38.252 --> 00:23:40.671
I have the highest security clearance
known to mankind. What...

00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:43.257
what is 30185?

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.342
We were sworn to secrecy.

00:23:46.802 --> 00:23:50.097
Well, why even mention it to me if you're
not going to tell me what it is?

00:23:50.764 --> 00:23:51.932
Sorry.

00:23:52.057 --> 00:23:54.351
- Can you tell me?
- Oh, yeah, we can tell you.

00:23:54.685 --> 00:23:58.522
It has to do with the time that
the Gate sent us back to 1969.

00:23:58.814 --> 00:24:01.859
Well, that can't have anything to do with me.
I wasn't born till a year later.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.070
Actually, it was nine months
before he was born.

00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:06.196
What?

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.740
You have to remember it was the '60s.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.243
<i>Come on...</i>

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.497
you have to have known that Jack's
always taken an interest in your life.

00:24:15.747 --> 00:24:16.665
<i>Jack?</i>

00:24:16.832 --> 00:24:18.041
O'Neill?

00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:20.169
Indeed.

00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:25.465
<i>Do you remember when you were chosen for the 302</i>
<i>program even though you didn't think you should get in?</i>

00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:27.718
How about when you were chosen for SG-1?

00:24:28.635 --> 00:24:29.803
Wait, are you saying that...

00:24:29.887 --> 00:24:31.847
- Jack O'Neill is...
- My daddy?

00:24:31.972 --> 00:24:34.892
All starting to make sense now, isn't it?

00:24:37.936 --> 00:24:40.272
Oh, I'm being punk'd, aren't I?

00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:43.483
We honestly can't tell you about 30185.

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:46.069
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

00:24:46.278 --> 00:24:50.574
The whole cast heard Marlowe is holding out for
more money, and now they're all joining in.

00:24:51.366 --> 00:24:53.410
Where do they think it comes from?

00:24:55.329 --> 00:24:58.165
How am I supposed to do a movie
without any actors?

00:24:58.248 --> 00:24:59.082
<i>Carter...</i>

00:24:59.249 --> 00:25:04.254
correct me if I'm wrong on this,but is it not a fact
of parallel dimension physics that each of us exists

00:25:04.296 --> 00:25:07.633
<i>somewhere in some universe in whatever way,</i>
<i>shape, or form we can imagine?</i>

00:25:07.674 --> 00:25:10.844
Any way, shape, or form we can imagine.
We've seen it for ourselves.

00:25:11.094 --> 00:25:12.387
There you go.

00:25:13.555 --> 00:25:15.057
Use your imagination.

00:25:25.108 --> 00:25:26.485
All right, people.

00:25:26.527 --> 00:25:33.367
We created this multi-billion dollar facility under
cheyenne mountain so that we can use this thing...

00:25:34.493 --> 00:25:36.119
anyone know how?

00:25:40.749 --> 00:25:43.752
Sir, we thought you knew.

00:25:44.294 --> 00:25:45.712
I do know this...

00:25:45.963 --> 00:25:48.048
we need to put together a team,

00:25:48.173 --> 00:25:53.470
starting with the most beautiful,
battle-ready scientific genius I know...

00:25:53.804 --> 00:25:57.724
- Captain Doctor Samantha Carter.
- Reporting for duty, Sir.

00:25:57.766 --> 00:25:59.726
What can you tell us, Captain?

00:26:02.145 --> 00:26:06.483
Well, at first glance, I suspect the device creates
a stable wormhole between superconducting rings

00:26:06.525 --> 00:26:10.737
that have been placed in fixed positions elsewhere...
... converts matter into energy at the event horizon...

00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:13.031
once the initial vortex has subsided, of course...

00:26:13.073 --> 00:26:15.158
and just because my sex organs are on the inside

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.244
instead of the outside doesn't
mean that I can't handle...

00:26:17.286 --> 00:26:20.247
provided, of course, that sufficient energy
has been channeled to the device

00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:22.624
and that the correct coordinates have been calculated.

00:26:24.376 --> 00:26:26.336
Okay, get to it.

00:26:27.504 --> 00:26:32.885
Next, we need a bookworm adventurer who
can say "brains" and "guts" in 27 languages...

00:26:32.926 --> 00:26:34.511
Dr. Daniel Jackson.

00:26:34.553 --> 00:26:37.014
Why have I been brought here? This is not...

00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:40.809
What is that?

00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:42.686
The reason you're here, Doctor.

00:26:42.728 --> 00:26:44.188
This big ring...

00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:47.608
was discovered in the sands of Egypt near giza.

00:26:48.984 --> 00:26:50.277
Then I was right.

00:26:50.861 --> 00:26:57.117
The pyramids really were landing sites for
interplanetary starships that enslaved primitive
human populations by posing as their gods.

00:26:57.826 --> 00:26:58.744
Well...

00:26:58.785 --> 00:27:00.954
we found the ring in the sand.

00:27:01.205 --> 00:27:03.290
These symbols, they look familiar.

00:27:03.874 --> 00:27:06.043
They're like constellations. Don't you see?

00:27:06.418 --> 00:27:07.419
Here.

00:27:09.963 --> 00:27:13.467
If each symbol represents a specific point in space,

00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:17.095
<i>then six of them would create a sort of box.</i>

00:27:17.137 --> 00:27:18.931
<i>The intersection point between those six points</i>

00:27:18.972 --> 00:27:20.933
would indicate a destination.

00:27:20.974 --> 00:27:22.976
Maybe, just maybe,

00:27:23.018 --> 00:27:26.188
the seventh marks the starting point.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.732
Is there a monitor that shows these symbols in detail?

00:27:28.815 --> 00:27:30.526
Over here, Dr. Jackson.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.951
<i>Wait.</i>

00:27:39.243 --> 00:27:40.911
This one seems different.

00:27:41.495 --> 00:27:43.080
<i>You found the ring in egypt...</i>

00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:44.831
the pyramid represents Earth.

00:27:44.873 --> 00:27:47.000
This symbol has to be the point of origin.

00:27:47.084 --> 00:27:49.545
It was under our noses the whole time.

00:27:50.087 --> 00:27:52.047
I feel so stupid.

00:27:52.589 --> 00:27:54.842
And now what this team needs is a leader,

00:27:54.883 --> 00:27:58.095
someone who'll laugh in the face of his enemy,

00:27:58.136 --> 00:28:00.639
even when it's inappropriate.

00:28:01.265 --> 00:28:02.891
Colonel Jack O'Neill.

00:28:03.392 --> 00:28:05.352
I thought I told you I retired.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.314
I thought you said you were tired.

00:28:11.024 --> 00:28:13.944
Well, as a matter of fact, I am a little tired.

00:28:13.986 --> 00:28:16.029
There's no time for that now.

00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:18.282
You have a mission to lead.

00:28:18.448 --> 00:28:19.616
Right!

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.578
Sergeant?

00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:24.079
Make it spin.

00:28:24.329 --> 00:28:25.539
Spin?

00:28:26.707 --> 00:28:28.250
Sir, it doesn't spin.

00:28:28.417 --> 00:28:29.418
What?

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.837
It has to spin. It's round.

00:28:32.087 --> 00:28:34.882
<i>Spinning is so much cooler than not spinning.</i>

00:28:35.007 --> 00:28:36.425
I'm the General.

00:28:36.466 --> 00:28:37.968
I want it to spin.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.011
Now!

00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:40.387
Yes, Sir.

00:28:44.141 --> 00:28:45.934
Hey, look at that.

00:28:50.647 --> 00:28:52.774
Chevron one is lit up.

00:28:52.816 --> 00:28:54.818
I wonder what we're going to find on the other side.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.737
Whatever it is, I'll bet it's amazing.

00:28:56.778 --> 00:28:58.030
Well, don't get too excited.

00:28:58.071 --> 00:28:59.865
It's just a simple recon.

00:28:59.907 --> 00:29:02.409
Aren't you the least bit
curious about what's out there?

00:29:02.451 --> 00:29:04.953
Well, I'm just hoping
we find some new meat for the team,

00:29:04.995 --> 00:29:08.248
preferably something bald,

00:29:08.457 --> 00:29:09.958
mysterious...

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.461
you know the warrior type with lots of,

00:29:12.503 --> 00:29:14.379
you know, muscles...

00:29:14.421 --> 00:29:18.842
Sir, the odds against any alien lifeforms
we encounter looking remotely human are

00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:20.385
astronomical.

00:29:20.427 --> 00:29:21.595
Yeah, well...

00:29:22.971 --> 00:29:24.181
we'll see.

00:29:27.351 --> 00:29:28.685
Chevron seven...

00:29:28.727 --> 00:29:30.479
also lit up.

00:29:38.028 --> 00:29:38.737
Holy...

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:41.365
Colonel O'Neill, you have a go.

00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:42.741
Godspeed.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.785
Easy for him to say.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.212
Okay,

00:29:56.046 --> 00:29:58.715
we're all going to do this together on three, right?

00:29:59.258 --> 00:30:00.384
Okay?

00:30:00.717 --> 00:30:01.844
Okay.

00:30:02.511 --> 00:30:03.595
One...

00:30:04.805 --> 00:30:05.389
two...

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.431
three!

00:30:14.356 --> 00:30:16.608
Dear god in heaven.

00:30:18.569 --> 00:30:21.697
I feel so stupid.

00:30:34.543 --> 00:30:37.254
Yeah, that'll work.

00:30:37.296 --> 00:30:39.381
A whole movie made with puppets.

00:30:39.423 --> 00:30:42.217
- Hey, I'm just saying...
<i>- Maybe we can have puppet O'Neill</i>

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:44.136
jump over a puppet shark

00:30:44.178 --> 00:30:46.430
on a one-third scale motorcycle.

00:30:47.556 --> 00:30:48.682
I don't get it.

00:30:48.724 --> 00:30:51.185
Look, you don't know the business like I do.

00:30:51.226 --> 00:30:53.103
I don't have any money,

00:30:53.145 --> 00:30:57.441
so I have to give the actors something else.

00
