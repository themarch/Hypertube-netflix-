00:00:01.793 --> 00:00:04.303
- What's your highest bounty?
- There is one job.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.919
- Underworld?
- Deep pocket.

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.007
Greef Karga said you were the best
in the parsec.

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:15.773
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting for you
upon delivery of the asset.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.938
You are Mandalorian!

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.767
I will help you.

00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:24.024
Many have passed through.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.566
They seek the same one.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.700
IG Unit! Stand down.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.240
You are a Guild member?

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:33.301
I have a suggestion.
We split the reward.

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:34.615
This is acceptable.

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:39.406
The tracking fob is still active.

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:40.915
There is a life form present.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.998
I thought you were dead.

00:11:28.397 --> 00:11:31.067
This is what was causing all the fuss?

00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:33.692
I think it's a child.

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:36.277
It is better to deliver it alive then.

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:39.827
My ship
has been destroyed. I'm trapped here.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.488
Stripped. Not destroyed.

00:11:43.245 --> 00:11:47.575
The Jawas steal. They don't destroy.

00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:50.956
Stolen or destroyed,
makes no difference to me.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.670
They're protected
by their crawling fortress.

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:58.297
There's no way to recover the parts.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:11:59.845
You can trade.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.388
With Jawas?
Are you out of your mind?

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:03.932
I will take you to them.

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:05.933
I have spoken.

00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:11.231
Hey! Spit that out.

00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:07.156
They really don't like you
for some reason.

00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:10.036
Well, I did disintegrate a few of them.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.420
You need to drop your rifle.

00:13:19.508 --> 00:13:22.588
I'm a Mandalorian.
Weapons are part of my religion.

00:13:22.678 --> 00:13:24.848
Then you are not getting your parts back.

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:29.559
Fine.

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:41.817
And the blaster.

00:13:46.702 --> 00:13:47.702
Good day.

00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:15.607
They will trade all the parts
for the beskar.

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:18.149
I'm not gonna trade anything.
These are my parts.

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:19.533
They stole them from me.

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:30.369
- You understand this?
- No!

00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:33.214
Whoa. Easy, easy.

00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:45.552
Get away from it!

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.989
The egg? What egg?

00:22:09.872 --> 00:22:11.122
Mando!

00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:15.207
I have it.

00:22:15.294 --> 00:22:16.504
I've got the egg.

00:23:08.555 --> 00:23:10.055
I'm surprised you waited.

00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:13.639
I'm surprised you took so long.

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:33.124
Is it still sleeping?

00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:37.169
Yes.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.130
Was it injured?

00:23:43.215 --> 00:23:46.545
I don't think so.
Not physically.

00:23:47.553 --> 00:23:49.353
Explain it to me again.

00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:52.848
I still don't understand what happened.

00:23:54.101 --> 00:23:55.601
Neither do I.

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:06.908
There's no way we're gonna get this to
work without a full maintenance facility.

00:24:07.322 --> 00:24:08.952
This is gonna take days to fix.

00:24:09.575 --> 00:24:12.325
If you care to help, it might go faster.

00:24:15.664 --> 00:24:17.674
There is much work to do.

00:25:26.235 --> 00:25:27.945
I can't thank you enough.

00:25:28.028 --> 00:25:30.198
Please allow me to give you
a portion of the reward.

00:25:31.073 --> 00:25:32.913
I cannot accept.

00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:37.201
You are my guest
and I am therefore in your service.

00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:45.298
I could use a crew member of your ability,
and I can pay handsomely.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:47.760
I am honored,

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.220
but I have worked a lifetime
to finally be free of servitude.

00:25:52.302 --> 00:25:56.012
I understand.
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

00:25:56.098 --> 00:25:57.598
And I offer mine.

00:25:57.975 --> 00:26:00.595
Thank you for bringing peace to my valley.

00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:18.369
And good luck with The Child.

00:26:18.453 --> 00:26:21.753
May it survive and bring you
a handsome reward.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.670
I have spoken.
