WEBVTT

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:21.779
We cannot hide our ways any longer.

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:23.275
Nor should we.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.007
The Ori have amassed
armies and move to destroy us.

00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:30.641
Everything we believe, all we are,
is an affront to them.

00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:33.634
They will stop at nothing
to destroy every last shred of evidence

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.552
that opposes their fanaticism.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.583
We have no choice.
We've tried to argue reason.

00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:41.959
We can fight.
Use what we know to oppose them.

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:45.757
-We are so few compared to them.
The Ark can change everything.

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:48.673
Is forced indoctrination really the answer?

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.128
You would deny the Ori
the very essence of self.

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:53.546
It is no different
than the murder they propose.

00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:56.193
The only moral way
to change someone's mind,

00:02:56.308 --> 00:03:00.221
make them see the truth, as you put it,
is to present evidence.

00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:03.789
We believe in the systematic
understanding of the physical world

00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:08.853
through observation and experimentation,
through argument and debate,

00:03:08.968 --> 00:03:13.994
but, most of all, freedom of will.
I will not compromise

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.291
the fundamental tenets of my devotion
in order to preserve it.

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:23.969
We acknowledge the incredible potential
of the technology of the Ark.

00:03:24.084 --> 00:03:27.230
And the danger such power presents.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.839
It will not be used as a weapon
against the Ori.

00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:32.563
The debate on the issue is closed.

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.508
Give me a hand?

00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:19.945
Really think this is it?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.592
Well, it's covered in Ancient writing.

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:25.623
These symbols here
are part of the oldest dialect I'm aware of.

00:04:25.738 --> 00:04:29.037
It says,
''Safely kept is the something of old.''

00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:31.723
What's the something, Daniel?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.409
Well, if I knew for sure,
I wouldn't have said ''the something...''

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:36.864
-Why am I answering her?
-Stop your yammering and open it.

00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:38.859
-We can't just open it.
-Why not?

00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:41.890
Well, if this is what I think it is,
it's a powerful piece of Ancient technology

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:43.923
capable of making anyone
who looks into it believe the Ori...

00:04:44.038 --> 00:04:45.228
-Are not Gods.
-...are not Gods.

00:04:45.304 --> 00:04:46.417
As far as we know.

00:04:46.532 --> 00:04:48.259
We already believe that.
No harm done. Open it.

00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:49.294
I said as far as we know.

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.213
There may be other things
it's capable of making you believe.

00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:52.901
Maybe we're supposed
to believe those other things, too.

00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:53.937
You know, that's beside the point.

00:04:54.013 --> 00:04:55.510
There's another reason
we can't just open it.

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.118
Look at my hands, all right?
They are raw and bleeding.

00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:00.037
I've broken every nail.

00:05:00.113 --> 00:05:02.684
We've been out here
in the scorching heat for days.

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:05.101
-I haven't showered.
-None of us have.

00:05:05.178 --> 00:05:06.712
That is painfully obvious.

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:10.089
Now, according to you,
this crusty old chest

00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:13.503
is our salvation from oppression
at the hands of the Ori army.

00:05:13.618 --> 00:05:17.225
Our best and, maybe,
only remaining chance that we have.

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:19.143
We've dug how many holes in the ground?

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.253
-Help me out here, muscles.
-Many.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.363
Now, all the years the Jaffa were here,

00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:25.013
they knew that Dakara
was the first landing place

00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:26.317
of the Alterans in this galaxy.

00:05:26.394 --> 00:05:29.003
You mean to tell me
they never looked for Ancient artifacts?

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.420
There were a few artifacts
that were excavated and cataloged

00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:33.530
when the city was being rebuilt.

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:34.834
But with the constant change
in leadership,

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.172
-little time or manpower...
-Yes, yes, yes, and blah, blah, blah.

00:05:38.287 --> 00:05:40.014
But here we are.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.738
Finally, we may have found it,
the ultimate weapon,

00:05:42.853 --> 00:05:45.500
so could someone please explain to me
why we can't confirm our blessed fortune

00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:48.186
-by simply opening it?
-Because it's sealed shut!

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:53.979
It literally won't open.

00:05:57.393 --> 00:05:58.506
Why didn't you say so?

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:02.151
Well, I was trying to,
but you wouldn't stop your yammering.

00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:04.491
No, no, no, no, no! You can't do that!

00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:07.100
I told you, this is a piece of technology.
You could damage it.

00:06:07.215 --> 00:06:08.673
It's been buried
for millions of years, Daniel.

00:06:08.788 --> 00:06:10.284
Quiet!

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:11.473
-What?
-What?

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.430
<i>Hey, kids, guess what?</i>

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:16.538
<i>We are under fire:</i>

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:41.629
I do not remember
sending out invitations to this party.

00:06:49.302 --> 00:06:51.028
We have to fall back!

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.032
Move ahead!

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.666
-What are you doing? We have to go there.
We know.

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:14.048
-What are you doing? We have to go there.
We know.

00:07:14.163 --> 00:07:16.541
-There's too many of them.
-There's no other way out of here.

00:07:16.656 --> 00:07:18.076
We know!

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.989
-How about now?
-Yeah, now works for me.

00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:36.338
Commander, we have them trapped.

00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:41.479
Vala, it's Tomin.

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:45.316
Throw down your weapons and surrender
and I promise you will all be spared.

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:49.382
That's funny.
I was just about to say the same thing.

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:53.871
Vala, you have to trust me. Your position
has been targeted from space.

00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:56.365
Comply now, or you will be destroyed.

00:07:56.787 --> 00:07:59.511
-I think we have to trust him.
-Jackson?

00:08:03.424 --> 00:08:05.534
What if we got them to open it?

00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:10.215
Well, it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world, would it?

00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:14.282
All right.

00:08:15.202 --> 00:08:16.660
Invite them in.

00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:19.729
You can come in.

00:08:33.157 --> 00:08:34.692
I look like crap.

00:08:51.304 --> 00:08:52.225
Hi.

00:08:54.642 --> 00:08:55.947
How are you?

00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:00.013
What's new?

00:09:08.684 --> 00:09:10.065
What are you doing here?

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.942
Wow, we really are on the same page.

00:09:13.671 --> 00:09:16.127
Took the words right out of my mouth.

00:09:17.738 --> 00:09:19.081
How did you know we were here?

00:09:19.196 --> 00:09:23.301
The power of the Ori
need not be questioned.

00:09:23.992 --> 00:09:25.450
Oh, here we go.

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:38.532
Tell me.
What is this artifact you have found?

00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:42.714
Hang on a second.
Shouldn't you know that already?

00:09:45.093 --> 00:09:46.052
Your logic.

00:09:46.129 --> 00:09:48.546
No, wait, wait.
No need to be difficult here.

00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:50.809
You want to know what it is, I'll tell you.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.876
Inside this Ark is the secret
to destroying the armies of the Ori,

00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:57.677
and I think the last thing
you're gonna want to do is open it.

00:09:57.792 --> 00:10:02.741
-You think I fear the contents?
-I'm saying you really should.

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:04.007
Open it.

00:10:05.503 --> 00:10:08.227
-You didn't hear what I just said?
-Open it!

00:10:12.524 --> 00:10:14.059
It's sealed shut.

00:10:16.514 --> 00:10:17.704
Wait! No!

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:42.603
Okay. Not what I was expecting.

00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:46.439
Foolhardy are those
who do not follow the path.

00:10:46.516 --> 00:10:49.509
Anyone want to bet
what he's gonna say next?

00:10:49.624 --> 00:10:53.038
-Kill them.
-Could've made money on that one.

00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:56.990
Prior. I gave them my word.

00:10:57.105 --> 00:10:59.369
If they surrendered peacefully,
they would be spared.

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:01.133
Your word?
The word of the Ori is all that matters.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.126
<i>The Book of Origin says that
truth is the beginning of the path!</i>

00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:07.233
Tomin, I grow tired of your questioning.

00:11:07.349 --> 00:11:11.991
Kill them now, or you shall burn
in the fire of everlasting torment!

00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:19.127
Don't do it. He can't hurt you, Tomin.

00:11:21.352 --> 00:11:22.772
We trusted you.

00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:25.112
Trust me now.

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:29.063
-Fire your weapon!
-You think he's testing you.

00:11:29.179 --> 00:11:30.521
But, really, he's forcing you to do it,

00:11:30.636 --> 00:11:33.476
because he's realized that, for some
reason beyond his comprehension,

00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:35.893
he's completely powerless.

00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:37.235
Kill them!

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.757
Kill them now! I command you!

00:11:47.747 --> 00:11:49.320
Stop! Do not fire!

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:04.398
-How?
-Here.

00:12:05.242 --> 00:12:06.700
I can show you.

00:12:12.647 --> 00:12:16.944
We use this device.
It temporarily neutralizes their abilities.

00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:33.748
According to Tomin,

00:12:33.825 --> 00:12:36.510
the Ori crusade is planning
to send a new wave of ships

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.812
through the Supergate sometime soon.

00:12:38.889 --> 00:12:41.689
A coordinated attack on Earth
may be imminent.

00:12:41.766 --> 00:12:43.838
That's a little non-specific.

00:12:43.953 --> 00:12:47.598
Yes, sir. I suspect the Priors
release details on a need-to-know basis.

00:12:47.713 --> 00:12:49.976
Shame you didn't find the real Ark.

00:12:50.053 --> 00:12:54.235
-Yes, sir, but not for a lack of trying.
-No other useful intelligence?

00:12:54.312 --> 00:12:56.077
Well, at the moment,
Tomin is coming to grips

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:59.414
with the fact that he's devoted his life
to serving false Gods.

00:12:59.491 --> 00:13:03.980
-Oh, great. What does he want?
-Who's that?

00:13:06.474 --> 00:13:09.006
Come on in. You might as well meet him.

00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:16.640
General. Colonel Mitchell.
I recognize you from your file.

00:13:16.756 --> 00:13:20.017
Mitchell, this is James Marrick,
IOA oversight.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:20.976
I'm a huge fan, Colonel.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

00:13:20.976 --> 00:13:23.623
I'm a huge fan, Colonel.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:25.810
What happened to Woolsey?

00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:28.304
His time was being taken up
by the Atlantis expedition,

00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:33.061
which, quite frankly, I'm grateful for.
It is a thrill for me to be here.

00:13:33.138 --> 00:13:35.171
You have been doing
such an incredible job

00:13:35.286 --> 00:13:37.511
under such difficult circumstances.

00:13:37.626 --> 00:13:39.046
I don't think there's gonna be
much for me to do here

00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:41.847
other than stay out of your way.

00:13:42.307 --> 00:13:43.765
What do you want?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.796
I believe protocol requires me
to notify you that I will be interrogating

00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:49.251
-the prisoner personally.
What prisoner?

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:53.663
I believe your report
refers to him as Tomin. No last name.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:59.533
Right, sorry. I get confused. See,
we were thinking of him more as a guest.

00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:03.446
Of course, my mistake.

00:14:04.099 --> 00:14:07.782
I trust the enemy commander
hell-bent on our total annihilation

00:14:07.858 --> 00:14:10.007
has been given comfortable quarters?

00:14:10.122 --> 00:14:12.117
Yeah. He's had a change of heart.

00:14:12.232 --> 00:14:13.728
Come on, Colonel.

00:14:13.805 --> 00:14:16.145
Don't all bad guys say that
after we capture them?

00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:20.097
Actually, he captured us,
and then he surrendered.

00:14:20.864 --> 00:14:23.627
And my people
have already questioned the man.

00:14:23.703 --> 00:14:26.120
I see. Look, I'm sorry.

00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:28.499
I really don't want to step
on any toes here.

00:14:28.614 --> 00:14:31.837
My superiors have asked me to prepare
a report on this matter personally,

00:14:31.914 --> 00:14:36.096
and I don't want to disappoint them,
me being new on the job and all.

00:14:36.172 --> 00:14:37.669
You understand.

00:14:39.318 --> 00:14:40.584
Of course.

00:14:41.467 --> 00:14:42.387
Thanks so much.

00:14:42.503 --> 00:14:46.224
I can't tell you how exciting it is
for me to be working here with you.

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:49.984
Actually, I used to do what you do,
Colonel, so I know exactly how it feels.

00:14:50.061 --> 00:14:52.516
I'm sure you know
I'm just trying to do my job.

00:14:52.631 --> 00:14:57.081
-Thank you, Mr. Marrick.
-General. Colonel.

00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:10.471
He used to do what I do?

00:15:10.548 --> 00:15:12.198
What the hell does that mean?
What's his background?

00:15:12.274 --> 00:15:14.538
Former CIA, black ops.

00:15:14.615 --> 00:15:18.911
Oh, great. So, the IOA is having
one of our own spies spy on us?

00:15:19.027 --> 00:15:22.288
I have no doubt
the IOA chose him carefully.

00:15:22.403 --> 00:15:25.625
Why do I get the feeling
we're gonna miss Woolsey?

00:15:28.963 --> 00:15:30.958
The Ori are dead and gone?

00:15:31.073 --> 00:15:32.953
As we said,
we don't exactly know for sure.

00:15:33.068 --> 00:15:34.948
We know we sent a weapon
to the Ori galaxy

00:15:35.025 --> 00:15:38.133
that was supposed to be capable
of destroying them.

00:15:43.964 --> 00:15:45.767
But not those that worshipped them?

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:48.683
No, not humans.
Just the Ascended beings.

00:15:49.604 --> 00:15:53.057
I know it sounds complicated,
but the point is, unless we stop it,

00:15:53.172 --> 00:15:57.200
this holy crusade in the name of the Ori
could end in a bloody mess for all humans.

00:15:57.315 --> 00:15:58.927
A futile bloody mess.

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:02.456
And your hope is that this Ark will
convince those that still believe in the Ori

00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:04.490
to stop believing as they do?

00:16:04.605 --> 00:16:06.408
<i>In Ancient, it's called armeria verimas:</i>

00:16:06.485 --> 00:16:09.477
Now, loosely translated,
it means ''the ark of truth.''

00:16:09.554 --> 00:16:11.894
I know I have no right to say this,
it just seems wrong.

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:14.235
Hey, I'm not saying it's right.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.537
Obviously, the Alterans didn't think
it was morally right to use it,

00:16:16.652 --> 00:16:18.186
or we wouldn't be in this situation.

00:16:18.263 --> 00:16:20.565
But compared to the bloodshed
we may be facing...

00:16:20.642 --> 00:16:22.483
We think the Ark may be
capable of brainwashing people

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.284
to believe whatever it's programed
to make them believe.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:27.854
But how did you know where to look?

00:16:27.931 --> 00:16:29.120
We didn't.

00:16:29.236 --> 00:16:32.228
That chest we found
was obviously not the Ark.

00:16:32.343 --> 00:16:34.799
But, still, you must've had some idea.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.272
I've had the vision several times.

00:16:47.766 --> 00:16:52.600
Daniel shared his mind with a former
Alteran named Merlin for a short time.

00:16:52.715 --> 00:16:54.595
His consciousness is gone now,
but he was the one

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.549
who helped me build the device
that was sent to eliminate the Ori.

00:16:57.664 --> 00:17:01.654
We hope. We think that these visions
might be remnants of Merlin's memories

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.683
left behind intentionally to steer us
in the direction of the Ark.

00:17:07.102 --> 00:17:09.404
And you think I'm crazy
for believing in the Ori?

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:13.893
Not crazy, Tomin. Just wrong.

00:17:16.655 --> 00:17:18.881
<i>You've both read the Book of Origin,
have you not?</i>

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:20.070
Yes.

00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:22.756
Do you not remember the part
about Ortus Mallum?

00:17:22.871 --> 00:17:24.444
You'll have to forgive me,
I don't know it by heart.

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:28.242
Oh, big book with fine print
and not many pictures.

00:17:29.776 --> 00:17:32.846
Ortus Mallum is the birthplace of all evil.

00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:35.800
The passage speaks of a mountain
that erupts and buries the place

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:38.140
where all evil once sprang forth.

00:17:38.754 --> 00:17:42.974
I only ask because you mentioned
a mountain that explodes in your vision.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.390
Amelius, what are you doing?
It's time to go.

00:18:01.505 --> 00:18:02.617
I know.

00:18:07.566 --> 00:18:09.408
They have to know the truth.

00:18:09.485 --> 00:18:12.477
They will find nothing.
All will be destroyed.

00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:21.110
My notebook.

00:18:27.708 --> 00:18:30.241
I had the most amazing idea last night.

00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:04.309
<i>While we think we could use
the ZPM onboard the Odyssey,</i>

00:19:04.424 --> 00:19:06.112
unfortunately,
it's nowhere near enough power

00:19:06.189 --> 00:19:08.453
to sustain an outgoing wormhole
indefinitely.

00:19:08.568 --> 00:19:11.599
I take it doing the whole Pegasus thing
again is not an option?

00:19:11.714 --> 00:19:15.013
The fact is, we were lucky to avoid
the attack from the Wraith the first time.

00:19:15.128 --> 00:19:16.394
<i>However, using the Odyssey,</i>

00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:20.001
we believe we can beam
four Mark IX nuclear devices strategically

00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:22.763
in between the Supergate's
individual segments.

00:19:22.916 --> 00:19:26.638
Hopefully, undetected, they'll be triggered
by any inbound gate activation.

00:19:26.753 --> 00:19:29.976
The resulting explosions should,
theoretically, create a chain reaction

00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:32.431
that will essentially utilize
the massive amounts of energy

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:35.807
being channeled into the gate
from the dialing galaxy to destroy it.

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:39.068
Don't blow it up just yet.
We may still need that Supergate.

00:19:39.145 --> 00:19:40.373
Dr. Jackson?

00:19:40.488 --> 00:19:42.521
The Ancients didn't bring
the Ark with them, sir.

00:19:42.636 --> 00:19:44.708
It's still in the Ori galaxy.

00:20:06.692 --> 00:20:07.958
Okay, then.

00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:16.321
I just need to get a few things
straight here for the record. Okay?

00:20:16.398 --> 00:20:18.316
It shouldn't be that hard.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.956
So, you're a commander in the Ori army?

00:20:24.071 --> 00:20:26.104
-I was.
-Yes, was.

00:20:27.371 --> 00:20:29.020
Of course.

00:20:29.135 --> 00:20:33.356
So, your duties as a commander involved?

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:35.811
Following the orders of the Priors.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.878
Supervising the warriors
under my command.

00:20:39.954 --> 00:20:41.067
Right.

00:20:41.758 --> 00:20:42.794
Good.

00:20:43.407 --> 00:20:45.364
See? No big deal.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.587
Okay. Moving on.

00:20:50.045 --> 00:20:51.618
In the time that you've been here
in our galaxy,

00:20:51.733 --> 00:20:55.493
how many innocent human beings
would you say you've slaughtered?

00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:58.025
I'm talking personally here.

00:20:58.715 --> 00:21:01.171
I'm sure you didn't keep a running tally,

00:21:01.286 --> 00:21:03.856
so maybe you could just give me
a general estimate.

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:06.158
-Hundreds? Thousands? More?
-What do you want from me?

00:21:06.273 --> 00:21:08.767
I just want you to answer my questions.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.606
And I have quite a few.

00:21:12.028 --> 00:21:14.790
They cover things like your plans,
your tactics, your numbers, training,

00:21:14.867 --> 00:21:16.670
anything that might help us
in defending against an attack

00:21:16.785 --> 00:21:18.742
-that you say is coming.
-I've already told the others all I know.

00:21:18.857 --> 00:21:21.159
How many innocent human beings
would you say you've slaughtered

00:21:21.236 --> 00:21:23.998
because they chose not
to believe in the Ori?

00:21:32.822 --> 00:21:36.390
-Where's Vala?
-She could not bear to watch.

00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:40.649
-Did you hear the plan?
-Tomin wishes to accompany us.

00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:42.490
He believes he can help us
establish contact

00:21:42.605 --> 00:21:45.138
with the anti-Ori underground.

00:21:45.214 --> 00:21:49.473
It may be, in fact, the best way to figure
out what Ortus Mallum actually is.

00:21:49.588 --> 00:21:52.197
Well, we can definitely use
all the help we can get,

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:56.110
assuming, of course,
the Ori are actually dead.

00:21:56.225 --> 00:21:58.987
Otherwise, this is gonna be
a very short mission.

00:21:59.064 --> 00:22:00.215
Indeed.

00:22:02.402 --> 00:22:03.323
General.

00:22:03.438 --> 00:22:06.354
Colonel, I was just giving Dr. Jackson
the good news.

00:22:06.469 --> 00:22:08.042
The mission's been approved!

00:22:08.157 --> 00:22:09.960
I thought it was already approved.

00:22:10.075 --> 00:22:14.679
Actually, no mission is approved
till the IOA officially signs off on it.

00:22:14.756 --> 00:22:16.981
<i>You've been given temporary command
of the Odyssey</i>

00:22:17.058 --> 00:22:19.436
for the duration of this operation.

00:22:20.204 --> 00:22:22.390
Sir, does that mean
I have to sit in the chair?

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:23.887
That it does.

00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:28.145
-And I wish the fun ended there.
-Sir?

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:31.828
Mr. Marrick
will be overseeing the mission.

00:22:34.629 --> 00:22:37.890
-Personally, I'm excited.
-Yeah. Me too.

00:22:38.005 --> 00:22:40.269
Yes, this'll be my first time
on one of our battlecruisers.

00:22:40.384 --> 00:22:43.798
We'll see you onboard, Colonel.
Dr. Jackson. General.

00:22:48.863 --> 00:22:50.321
Can I confine him to quarters?

00:22:50.781 --> 00:22:51.817
It's your call, Colonel.

00:22:52.546 --> 00:22:55.577
One of the decisions those of us
in command have to make.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.487
Thank you, sir.

00:23:02.406 --> 00:23:03.825
Thank you, sir.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.222
Pre-flight.

00:23:14.337 --> 00:23:16.064
We're ready to go, sir.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.136
All right.

00:23:20.054 --> 00:23:21.704
Weapons to maximum.

00:23:22.816 --> 00:23:26.077
-Sir?
-It's a joke, Marks. Make it go.

00:23:58.535 --> 00:24:01.182
Nothing I have done
since turning against the Goa'uld

00:24:01.259 --> 00:24:04.980
will make up for the atrocities
I once committed in their name.

00:24:08.126 --> 00:24:11.502
Somewhere deep inside you,
you knew it was wrong.

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:14.917
A voice you did not recognize
screamed for you to stop.

00:24:16.068 --> 00:24:18.561
You saw no way out.

00:24:18.638 --> 00:24:20.902
It was the way things were.

00:24:20.978 --> 00:24:23.357
They could not be changed.

00:24:23.472 --> 00:24:27.807
You tried to convince yourself
the people you were hurting deserved it.

00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:30.570
You became numb
to their pain and suffering.

00:24:30.685 --> 00:24:33.984
You learned to shut out
the voice speaking against it.

00:24:36.248 --> 00:24:38.435
-There's always a choice.
-Indeed, there is.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.504
-I chose to ignore it.
-Yet you sit here now.

00:24:44.113 --> 00:24:46.530
I sit here,

00:24:46.645 --> 00:24:49.292
and I cannot imagine the day
when I will forgive myself.

00:24:49.407 --> 00:24:51.364
Because it will never come.

00:24:52.937 --> 00:24:56.505
One day, others may try to convince you
they have forgiven you.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.999
That is more about them than you.

00:24:59.996 --> 00:25:02.835
For them, imparting forgiveness
is a blessing.

00:25:04.408 --> 00:25:06.403
How do you go on?

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.623
It is simple.
You will never forgive yourself.

00:25:10.739 --> 00:25:12.618
Accept it.

00:25:12.695 --> 00:25:18.603
You hurt others. Many others.
That cannot be undone.

00:25:18.719 --> 00:25:21.711
You will never find personal retribution.

00:25:22.862 --> 00:25:25.356
But your life does not have to end.

00:25:25.471 --> 00:25:28.924
That which is right,
just and true can still prevail.

00:25:30.382 --> 00:25:34.947
If you do not fight for what you believe in,
all may be lost for everyone else.

00:25:35.945 --> 00:25:40.702
But do not fight for yourself,
fight for others,

00:25:40.817 --> 00:25:43.579
others that may be saved
through your effort.

00:25:46.073 --> 00:25:48.183
That is the least you can do.

00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:14.847
Okay, I think we're ready.

00:26:14.962 --> 00:26:16.267
Dial it up.

00:26:44.657 --> 00:26:46.537
Looks like we have a stable connection.

00:26:46.614 --> 00:26:47.573
Hmm.

00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:50.182
What?

00:26:51.448 --> 00:26:53.635
Based on the intel Daniel provided
when he was a Prior,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.246
I was pretty sure this was gonna work.

00:26:55.323 --> 00:26:58.277
Yeah. I didn't doubt that. It's just...

00:26:58.392 --> 00:27:01.884
Now that we're actually here,
it's kind of cool.

00:27:05.298 --> 00:27:06.603
Take her in.

00:28:19.459 --> 00:28:21.684
-You see that?
-What?

00:28:26.787 --> 00:28:28.858
That old man? What about him?

00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:32.810
Nothing.

00:28:33.923 --> 00:28:35.726
Glad we had this chat.

00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:40.790
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

00:28:41.634 --> 00:28:44.857
In fact, I get the feeling
we're on the right track.

00:28:49.998 --> 00:28:51.724
This is Hertis.

00:28:51.839 --> 00:28:55.062
Hertis, this is Daniel. Vala, my wife.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.438
We are still married.

00:28:59.014 --> 00:29:01.354
We'll talk about that later.

00:29:01.469 --> 00:29:05.689
Tomin tells me you've not heard the rumor
that the fires of Celestis have gone out.

00:29:05.766 --> 00:29:06.917
Really?

00:29:07.684 --> 00:29:11.214
I assume Tomin also explained
that we're not from around here.

00:29:11.329 --> 00:29:12.672
That he did.

00:29:13.132 --> 00:29:14.053
Still, I'm surprised.

00:29:14.168 --> 00:29:15.933
Such news would have spread
far and wide.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.391
You would think.

00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:21.342
But perhaps Tomin didn't explain
exactly how far away we live.

00:29:21.457 --> 00:29:24.795
The Priors have seen this as a sign
that the Ori are not pleased.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.517
They say our efforts against
the crusade of evil are not enough.

00:29:28.632 --> 00:29:29.629
That we must do more.

00:29:29.744 --> 00:29:32.046
As I told you,
many more ships have been built.

00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:34.080
They are ready to embark.

00:29:34.195 --> 00:29:37.916
Tomin also tells me you seek
the true location of Ortus Mallum.

00:29:37.993 --> 00:29:40.947
-We do.
-I'm curious,

00:29:41.062 --> 00:29:44.323
what makes you think such a place
actually exists in the real world?

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.280
<i>You don't believe
all that is written in the Book of Origin</i>

00:29:46.357 --> 00:29:48.697
to be based on some true historical event?

00:29:48.812 --> 00:29:50.999
What I believe is not the issue.

00:29:51.114 --> 00:29:54.183
-You want me to tell you what I believe?
-No.

00:29:55.142 --> 00:29:56.907
I want you to prove it.

00:29:58.135 --> 00:29:59.785
Well, that we can do.

00:30:12.522 --> 00:30:14.594
There are ruins of a village
high in the mountains

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.164
that border the plains of Celestis.

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:19.735
<i>That is believed to be
the location the Book of Origin references</i>

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.384
as the birthplace of evil.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.221
Well, it makes sense. The Ori followers
built their holy city on the planet

00:30:25.298 --> 00:30:28.329
where they believe their Gods
once triumphed over the Alterans.

00:30:28.405 --> 00:30:30.515
Celestis is not on this planet, though.

00:30:30.631 --> 00:30:32.088
You got us here.

00:30:32.204 --> 00:30:33.892
If we showed you a star map,
could you direct us

00:30:33.968 --> 00:30:37.076
to the coordinates of the planet
where Celestis is?

00:30:38.457 --> 00:30:41.450
We're talking about the Vatican
of the Ori followers, right?

00:30:41.565 --> 00:30:43.713
Well, if the fires are out,

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:46.245
then it's likely Merlin's device worked
and the Ori are dead.

00:30:46.322 --> 00:30:48.164
But the Priors are not.

00:30:49.583 --> 00:30:51.425
Well, we didn't come all this way
to stop now, did we?

00:30:51.501 --> 00:30:52.576
Many times throughout history,

00:30:52.652 --> 00:30:54.149
the ruins at Ortus Mallum
have been searched

00:30:54.264 --> 00:30:58.254
by both the Priors of Ori
and those that believe as we do.

00:30:58.369 --> 00:31:00.517
We have long searched for the artifacts
that would prove the truth

00:31:00.594 --> 00:31:05.390
<i>about our past, our ancestors,
and the falsehood of the Book of Origin:</i>

00:31:05.505 --> 00:31:07.692
Nothing has ever been found there.

00:31:07.807 --> 00:31:09.150
That's good.

00:31:09.917 --> 00:31:12.833
Let's hope that means
what we're looking for is still there.

00:31:13.523 --> 00:31:14.597
Mmm.

00:31:22.309 --> 00:31:24.956
Why was I not notified that you had
someone onboard with new intel

00:31:25.071 --> 00:31:26.414
about Ori army activity?

00:31:26.491 --> 00:31:28.371
Well, I'm sure I called for you.
There was no answer.

00:31:28.447 --> 00:31:29.522
Oh, wait.

00:31:29.637 --> 00:31:31.440
I may have not have pressed
the comm button all the way down.

00:31:31.555 --> 00:31:34.241
Wow, I must look stupid
standing there talking to myself.

00:31:34.356 --> 00:31:35.890
Anyway, if you'll excuse us.

00:31:36.005 --> 00:31:39.573
Colonel. I'm sure I don't need to remind
you about protocol.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.870
We are all going to find the Ark,
Mr. Marrick.

00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:45.712
It's just too late for you not to join us.

00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:47.592
You were granted the use of this ship,

00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:50.201
the most valuable asset Earth
currently has at its disposal

00:31:50.316 --> 00:31:53.615
to prevent any further Ori ships
from getting through the Supergate.

00:31:53.692 --> 00:31:54.805
And that's what we're gonna do.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.411
Do you or do you not
have reliable intelligence

00:31:58.488 --> 00:32:01.058
that more Ori ships are about to leave?

00:32:01.634 --> 00:32:03.245
Stay out of my way.

00:32:07.082 --> 00:32:09.230
-Your instructions were clear, Colonel.
-We're not there yet.

00:32:09.307 --> 00:32:12.338
Major Marks, new coordinates have been
entered into the nav system.

00:32:12.414 --> 00:32:14.409
-Take us there.
-Yes, sir.

00:32:14.486 --> 00:32:16.481
You have no idea how much time we have.

00:32:16.596 --> 00:32:20.318
I am not going to sacrifice this mission,
Earth, or our galaxy for some fool's quest.

00:32:20.433 --> 00:32:21.967
Then replace me!

00:32:23.962 --> 00:32:25.727
You have the authority.

00:32:27.415 --> 00:32:28.605
Go ahead.

00:32:29.372 --> 00:32:30.676
Replace me.

00:32:44.641 --> 00:32:46.521
You sure you don't want the chair?

00:32:46.636 --> 00:32:48.823
No. It's all yours.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.883
-Got your back, though.
-Thanks.

00:33:24.426 --> 00:33:26.652
Any idea where to start?

00:33:26.728 --> 00:33:27.994
Not really.

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:49.636
You okay?

00:34:50.826 --> 00:34:53.780
I was thinking
about what this place really was.

00:34:58.384 --> 00:35:00.724
<i>Colonel Mitchell:
This is Major Marks: Come in:</i>

00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:02.220
We read you, Marks, go ahead.

00:35:02.335 --> 00:35:04.868
<i>Sir, someone has turned on
the Asgard core:</i>

00:35:04.983 --> 00:35:06.709
-What?
-Who?

00:35:06.824 --> 00:35:08.435
You really need to ask?

00:35:08.551 --> 00:35:12.579
According to the security access card
that was used, it's Mr. Marrick,

00:35:12.656 --> 00:35:15.341
<i>but the room is sealed
and he is not responding on the comm:</i>

00:35:15.456 --> 00:35:17.873
It can't be shut down remotely.
What the hell does he think he's doing?

00:35:17.989 --> 00:35:19.830
I don't know, but we better find out.

00:35:19.945 --> 00:35:22.631
Jackson! Teal'c! We gotta go.
Keep looking.

00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:24.549
-What's wrong?
-Marrick's up to something.

00:35:24.626 --> 00:35:26.621
He's turned on the Asgard core.

00:35:26.698 --> 00:35:29.038
That will alert the Ori ships
to our presence.

00:35:29.153 --> 00:35:34.793
Yeah, I think that's the idea.
We got it. You guys, find the Ark.

00:35:34.869 --> 00:35:38.706
Marks, transport Colonel Carter
and myself back up to the ship now.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.556
It's SG-3, sir. Transmitting from P6X-437.

00:35:52.671 --> 00:35:53.899
On screen.

00:35:55.894 --> 00:35:58.733
<i>General, a Prior arrived
through the gate 15 minutes ago</i>

00:35:58.848 --> 00:36:01.073
<i>and immediately made contact:</i>

00:36:01.188 --> 00:36:04.372
<i>Not sure how,
but he seemed to know we were here:</i>

00:36:04.488 --> 00:36:05.677
<i>He said he has no intention of harming us,</i>

00:36:05.792 --> 00:36:08.516
<i>just that he has a message to deliver
to the leaders of our planet:</i>

00:36:08.593 --> 00:36:09.935
What is it?

00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:13.734
<i>Wouldn't get into it, sir:
Says he'll only deliver it in person:</i>

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.537
He wants us to let him through the gate?

00:36:15.652 --> 00:36:16.649
<i>Yes, sir:</i>

00:36:16.726 --> 00:36:20.102
And does he know this didn't exactly
work out well the last time?

00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:22.251
<i>More for the Prior in question than us, sir:</i>

00:36:22.366 --> 00:36:23.440
True.

00:36:26.356 --> 00:36:28.197
<i>He's pretty adamant:</i>

00:36:28.274 --> 00:36:31.152
<i>Says the message is key
to human survival on Earth:</i>

00:36:31.267 --> 00:36:33.338
<i>Says he knows that we have
the technology</i>

00:36:33.454 --> 00:36:35.410
<i>that can temporarily
neutralize his powers:</i>

00:36:35.525 --> 00:36:36.830
He does, does he?

00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:37.981
<i>Yes, sir:</i>

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:41.856
<i>Apparently, word that SG-1
actually killed a Prior is getting around:</i>

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:45.002
Give us an hour
to make the necessary preparations.

00:36:45.078 --> 00:36:46.536
<i>Yes, sir: Reynolds out:</i>

00:36:54.286 --> 00:36:55.821
Open the door, Mr. Marrick.

00:36:55.936 --> 00:36:59.158
Do you really think
we can't bypass the security lock?

00:36:59.926 --> 00:37:01.576
<i>Answer me, Marrick:</i>

00:37:04.491 --> 00:37:08.750
<i>You have put this ship
and everyone on board in serious danger:</i>

00:37:08.827 --> 00:37:11.589
<i>Look, you know
that activating the Asgard core</i>

00:37:11.704 --> 00:37:15.119
<i>will alert any Ori vessels to our presence:</i>

00:37:15.195 --> 00:37:19.300
I assume that's your plan,
force me to take action against them.

00:37:19.415 --> 00:37:20.912
-Carter?
-Almost.

00:37:30.925 --> 00:37:32.537
It won't shut down.

00:37:33.457 --> 00:37:34.416
No.

00:37:34.493 --> 00:37:37.140
It's creating something virtually.
What is it?

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:39.289
You'll see. I believe it's almost done.

00:37:39.404 --> 00:37:41.207
What the hell are you thinking?

00:37:41.284 --> 00:37:43.509
Unlike you, doing the job
that I was sent to do,

00:37:43.624 --> 00:37:46.041
stop any further Ori invasion at all costs.

00:37:46.156 --> 00:37:49.302
Well, how does getting us killed
and this ship destroyed accomplish that?

00:37:49.417 --> 00:37:51.374
Oh, I assure you,
that's not the plan, Colonel.

00:37:51.451 --> 00:37:52.563
Oh, really?

00:37:52.678 --> 00:37:54.865
Because we're about to be surrounded
by a bunch of Ori ships,

00:37:54.942 --> 00:37:56.515
so I figure we got two options,

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.814
we can shut that thing down,
and hope to outrun them,

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.308
or we can stay and fight and lose badly.

00:38:02.423 --> 00:38:04.035
And that's where you're wrong.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.411
There are always other options.
You're just failing to consider them.

00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:25.328
Well, I hate to be the downer at this party,
but this is hopeless.

00:38:25.404 --> 00:38:26.901
I'm not getting any energy readings,

00:38:27.016 --> 00:38:30.046
so, short of literally looking under
every rock and stone on this mountain,

00:38:30.162 --> 00:38:32.694
I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.

00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:58.744
Or we could wait for Daniel
to have another one of his visions.

00:39:05.957 --> 00:39:08.374
Guys, I think there's something here.

00:39:37.071 --> 00:39:39.680
I think we're supposed to go down there.

00:39:45.205 --> 00:39:46.164
This is Colonel Carter.

00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:48.581
We need an A.R.G.
in the Asgard core room now.

00:39:48.658 --> 00:39:50.998
Don't worry, Colonel.
It's being contained by a force shield.

00:39:51.113 --> 00:39:52.110
For now!

00:39:52.226 --> 00:39:55.026
If you knew anything about these things,
you'd know nothing will hold it for long.

00:39:55.141 --> 00:39:59.208
Do you have any idea what it finally took
to eradicate these little buggers?

00:39:59.323 --> 00:40:03.352
Exactly why it'll be so effective
in neutralizing the Ori fleet.

00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:07.111
That's your plan?
What are you, totally nuts?

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.411
Not my plan. It was the IOA's.

00:40:11.715 --> 00:40:14.900
In the event that the Supergate
on this side was impossible to destroy,

00:40:15.015 --> 00:40:17.048
a backup plan was devised.

00:40:17.163 --> 00:40:20.961
<i>We knew we could draw the Ori
to the Odyssey by turning on the core.</i>

00:40:21.038 --> 00:40:24.261
Yes, we might lose an all-out battle
with a large number of them,

00:40:24.376 --> 00:40:26.026
but we'd certainly be able
to hang in long enough

00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:28.558
to get this Replicator
on board one of their ships,

00:40:28.673 --> 00:40:33.123
at which point, hopefully,
we'll be able to escape.

00:40:33.622 --> 00:40:37.420
And since you were unwilling
to even try to destroy the gate,

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:38.993
you left me no choice.

00:40:39.108 --> 00:40:41.717
We came here to find the Ark.

00:40:43.213 --> 00:40:45.707
Nobody expected you to find it.

00:40:45.822 --> 00:40:47.280
Excuse me?

00:40:47.395 --> 00:40:51.884
The Ori ships are preparing to leave.
For all we know, they're already gone.

00:40:51.999 --> 00:40:54.186
Obviously, you didn't come up
with this on your own.

00:40:54.263 --> 00:40:56.488
Who wrote this program?

00:40:56.565 --> 00:40:58.406
Does it really matter?

00:41:00.094 --> 00:41:01.322
Thank you.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.468
The A.R.G. won't penetrate the shield.

00:41:04.583 --> 00:41:06.962
When I shut it down,
don't hesitate and don't miss.

00:41:07.077 --> 00:41:08.266
I won't.

00:41:20.965 --> 00:41:23.574
-Zats have no effect on them.
-Neither does this thing.

00:41:23.689 --> 00:41:26.144
You need P90s.
Don't let it get away.

00:41:27.334 --> 00:41:29.405
Why the hell didn't it work?

00:41:29.521 --> 00:41:32.590
I believe that particular susceptibility
was programmed out of this version.

00:41:32.705 --> 00:41:35.467
You slick son of a bitch.
Why didn't you tell us?

00:41:35.544 --> 00:41:38.805
You obviously had no intention of allowing
me to follow through with the plan.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.220
If we can't stop it, it will cannibalize
this ship and start replicating.

00:41:42.335 --> 00:41:43.754
I should hope so.

00:41:43.831 --> 00:41:45.519
And thanks to you,
it's now the only way we have

00:41:45.596 --> 00:41:47.361
of infecting the Ori fleet.

00:41:47.476 --> 00:41:49.471
And what the hell is the IOA gonna do

00:41:49.586 --> 00:41:51.312
when the Replicators
finish with the Ori fleet

00:41:51.427 --> 00:41:53.768
and they decide to take a little trip
back through the Supergate?

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:57.834
Precautions to prevent that scenario
have been put in place.

00:41:57.911 --> 00:42:00.060
Self-destruct.

00:42:00.175 --> 00:42:03.052
You built in some sort of shut-down
command into the programming.

00:42:03.167 --> 00:42:05.469
I told you. It wasn't me.

00:42:14.485 --> 00:42:17.554
Sir, 12 teams of two have been armed
and are searching top to bottom.

00:42:17.631 --> 00:42:19.127
These things are crafty, Captain.

00:42:19.242 --> 00:42:21.583
They'll avoid any area of the ship
exposed to internal sensors.

00:42:21.659 --> 00:42:23.846
They're small enough
to use the ventilation shafts

00:42:23.923 --> 00:42:26.186
or to move through hollow walls,
and it's only a matter of time

00:42:26.263 --> 00:42:27.606
before we could be dealing
with more than one.

00:42:27.683 --> 00:42:29.332
We'll find it, sir.

00:42:30.483 --> 00:42:31.941
Carter. Talk to me.

00:42:32.056 --> 00:42:34.704
The Asgard core was designed to be
very user-friendly.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.855
Whoever wrote this program

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.233
didn't have to have an extensive
knowledge of Replicator technology.

00:42:38.348 --> 00:42:40.113
They only had to explain
what they wanted to create,

00:42:40.228 --> 00:42:42.377
-and the core filled in the blanks.
-And?

00:42:42.492 --> 00:42:44.602
Unfortunately, that means
that the complete program

00:42:44.717 --> 00:42:46.137
exists only in the core database.

00:42:46.252 --> 00:42:47.671
Which means that you have
to leave the core on

00:42:47.786 --> 00:42:49.321
if you're gonna find
the self-destruct command.

00:42:49.398 --> 00:42:50.817
If it even exists.

00:42:50.932 --> 00:42:52.352
-How long?
-I don't know.

00:42:52.467 --> 00:42:54.385
I'm trying to narrow down
the search parameters, but it's huge.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.572
All right, look, just forget about the fact
that we're standing here

00:42:56.687 --> 00:42:58.720
screaming and waving our hands
at the Ori.

00:42:58.836 --> 00:43:00.524
They probably already
know our position anyway.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.943
All right, let's jump into hyperspace.

00:43:02.058 --> 00:43:03.746
At least the Ori ships
won't be able to attack us.

00:43:03.861 --> 00:43:06.854
Yeah, but they can track us in hyperspace,
and we can't stay there forever.

00:43:06.969 --> 00:43:10.230
Look, believe me, if we don't find that
Replicator or this self-destruct command,

00:43:10.307 --> 00:43:12.494
''forever,'' not gonna be a big issue.

00:43:40.999 --> 00:43:42.380
<i>Hey, guys, this is Mitchell:</i>

00:43:42.496 --> 00:43:44.529
<i>We're going to have to beam you
aboard immediately:</i>

00:43:44.606 --> 00:43:46.486
Wait, you can't. Not yet.

00:43:46.562 --> 00:43:49.363
<i>Yeah, well, Marrick
activated the Asgard core,</i>

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.008
<i>so we're expecting Ori ships
around here sometime soon:</i>

00:43:53.084 --> 00:43:56.768
<i>Plus, we have a little Replicator problem,
so we're gonna jump into hyperspace</i>

00:43:56.844 --> 00:43:59.069
<i>to avoid the bad guys
while we deal with it:</i>

00:43:59.146 --> 00:44:02.177
I'm sorry, did you say Replicator problem?

00:44:02.292 --> 00:44:04.249
<i>Unfortunately, yes, I did:</i>

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:10.426
Major Marks, transport the team
on the planet back up to the ship.

00:44:10.541 --> 00:44:13.188
As soon as they are safely on board,
take us into hyperspace.

00:44:13.303 --> 00:44:15.605
Sir, I am attempting to transport
the team on the surface,

00:44:15.682 --> 00:44:17.984
but the system is not responding.

00:44:19.173 --> 00:44:21.859
I've lost control of the ship's computer.

00:44:23.278 --> 00:44:25.312
-It's plugged itself in somewhere.
-That was fast.

00:44:25.427 --> 00:44:26.501
Well, it doesn't have much learning to do.

00:44:26.616 --> 00:44:27.920
<i>Everything about the Odyssey
and its systems</i>

00:44:28.035 --> 00:44:30.529
has been preprogrammed
into the Replicator's memory.

00:44:30.644 --> 00:44:33.560
I'm attempting to isolate life support,
navigation, and hyperdrive command,

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:35.325
and restrict it to the Asgard core.

00:44:35.402 --> 00:44:37.665
Hopefully, I can maintain
some measure of control from here.

00:44:37.742 --> 00:44:40.581
All right, I'm gonna help find
the damn thing.

00:44:44.993 --> 00:44:46.374
What's a Replicator?

00:44:46.489 --> 00:44:48.408
You do not wish to know.

00:44:49.482 --> 00:44:51.055
<i>Yeah, it's me again,</i>

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.469
<i>your friendly neighborhood
ship's commander:</i>

00:44:54.584 --> 00:44:56.311
<i>Looks like you've got
a little more time down there:</i>

00:44:56.388 --> 00:44:59.227
<i>We're having a bit of trouble
with the beaming thing at the moment:</i>

00:44:59.303 --> 00:45:01.912
<i>I promise, you'll be the first to know:::</i>

00:45:07.974 --> 00:45:10.314
Okay, so... Onward.

00:45:28.269 --> 00:45:30.303
What do you think, muscles?

00:45:38.782 --> 00:45:42.311
Wait, wait, wait! You can't!
We don't know how stable this tunnel is.

00:45:43.117 --> 00:45:45.726
Shall we turn back then, Daniel Jackson?

00:45:48.565 --> 00:45:49.831
Bombs away.

00:45:59.499 --> 00:46:01.954
<i>Sir, we have lost
external communications array,</i>

00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:06.059
<i>and we are experiencing power
fluctuations throughout the power grid:</i>

00:46:09.474 --> 00:46:11.085
Yeah, I got that.

00:47:07.636 --> 00:47:09.094
Daniel Jackson.

00:47:26.474 --> 00:47:27.855
This is it.

00:47:28.852 --> 00:47:31.768
-Oh, you're sure this time?
-Definitely.

00:47:32.497 --> 00:47:33.840
We found it.

00:47:58.471 --> 00:48:03.880
You demonstrate great courage
facing me in person, General.

00:48:03.995 --> 00:48:07.525
Courage is only required
when facing that which you fear.

00:48:09.213 --> 00:48:12.436
The flames of ignorance burn without pain.

00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:17.461
Beware the power,
or it will consume you before you know.

00:48:17.538 --> 00:48:19.955
You can skip the fire and brimstone.

00:48:20.607 --> 00:48:23.562
If you're here to tell me
that you're finally coming after Earth,

00:48:23.677 --> 00:48:25.787
I already know.

00:48:25.902 --> 00:48:27.628
It is not too late.

00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:32.040
Allow me to deliver
the message to your world

00:48:32.155 --> 00:48:37.527
that Origin is the way to salvation
and you will all be spared.

00:48:37.603 --> 00:48:41.095
I have to tell you,
even if I did let you have your say,

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.895
I don't think my world is gonna listen.

00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:46.312
Then you are all doomed.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.146
That may be so,

00:48:51.262 --> 00:48:54.101
but I don't think it's you that's gonna do it.

00:48:55.021 --> 00:48:57.477
I would not be so sure.

00:48:57.592 --> 00:49:00.431
Really? What took you so long?

00:49:00.546 --> 00:49:03.462
Earth has to be the most densely
populated planet in the galaxy.

00:49:03.577 --> 00:49:05.457
What're you waiting for?

00:49:05.534 --> 00:49:08.871
Sure, you've tried to warn us
a couple of times, but, come on,

00:49:08.986 --> 00:49:11.135
you can do better than that, can't you?

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:14.780
We've been a tremendous pain
in your proverbial backside.

00:49:16.583 --> 00:49:17.657
You don't really expect me to believe

00:49:17.772 --> 00:49:21.417
that you've just been saving
the best for last, do you?

00:49:23.489 --> 00:49:26.289
What's wrong?
You guys are never speechless.

00:49:28.821 --> 00:49:30.778
I'll tell you what I think.

00:49:32.581 --> 00:49:36.303
I say this move reeks of desperation.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.679
You're not all that sure it's a slam-dunk.

00:49:39.794 --> 00:49:43.746
Your defenses are no match
for the might of the Ori,

00:49:43.861 --> 00:49:46.086
which shall rain down apocalypse upon...

00:49:46.201 --> 00:49:48.695
Right, right. Now here's a newsflash,

00:49:49.922 --> 00:49:51.457
the Ori are dead.

00:49:52.378 --> 00:49:53.797
We killed them.

00:49:54.603 --> 00:49:56.368
Sent a weapon devised by an ex-Ancient

00:49:56.483 --> 00:49:59.130
through the Supergate
and wiped them all out.

00:49:59.207 --> 00:50:01.547
These beings you call Gods,

00:50:01.662 --> 00:50:05.883
the ones who lied to you, manipulated you

00:50:05.959 --> 00:50:10.985
for their own selfish,
power-hungry reasons, are gone,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:15.934
and everything you think you're doing
in their name is entirely without meaning.

00:50:17.507 --> 00:50:19.349
I was wrong.

00:50:19.464 --> 00:50:22.303
You are not courageous, General.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:25.104
You are without reason.

00:50:25.219 --> 00:50:29.170
Your planet will burn
in all the depths of darkness.

00:50:29.286 --> 00:50:31.511
Oh, we'll see about that.

00:50:31.626 --> 00:50:35.040
There is one thing I do know for sure.

00:50:35.155 --> 00:50:39.299
If we're going to hell,
then you're coming with us.

00:50:42.253 --> 00:50:45.169
You go ahead
and burst into flames if you like.

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:01.666
<i>Sir, we think
we've traced the problem</i>

00:51:01.743 --> 00:51:02.855
<i>to the rear auxiliary control room</i>

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.313
<i>in your level:</i>

00:51:04.889 --> 00:51:06.155
Copy that.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.755
All personnel, this is Colonel Mitchell.
Pleased to report I got it.

00:51:30.517 --> 00:51:31.860
Oh, shit.

00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:43.945
Hey, Sam!
They seem to be living up to their name.

00:51:44.022 --> 00:51:45.134
<i>There's definitely more
than one at this point:</i>

00:51:45.249 --> 00:51:47.436
-How many?
-A lot!

00:51:50.736 --> 00:51:53.229
<i>The original has probably
converted into a queen by now:</i>

00:51:53.344 --> 00:51:55.033
The good news
is that it's likely stationary.

00:51:55.148 --> 00:51:56.836
Other Replicators will bring it
raw material

00:51:56.912 --> 00:51:58.524
that it will then use to create new blocks.

00:51:58.639 --> 00:52:01.440
That's what you're looking for
at this point.

00:52:01.555 --> 00:52:02.667
Cam?

00:52:03.588 --> 00:52:04.777
Cam?

00:52:17.553 --> 00:52:19.932
Daniel, for goodness sakes,
stop fussing and just open it.

00:52:20.047 --> 00:52:21.620
Wait, wait, wait!

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:34.587
What was supposed to happen?

00:52:34.664 --> 00:52:37.925
Nothing. I don't think it's turned on.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.498
Maybe it's broken.

00:52:39.613 --> 00:52:41.493
Perhaps its power source
has been depleted.

00:52:41.608 --> 00:52:42.951
Well, it is millions of years old.

00:52:43.066 --> 00:52:44.793
I don't think it's turned on.

00:52:44.869 --> 00:52:46.788
Well, turn it on, then.

00:52:46.864 --> 00:52:48.284
I think...

00:52:49.243 --> 00:52:52.044
It has something to do
with these symbols.

00:52:52.773 --> 00:52:54.653
They look like buttons.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:04.321
Perhaps we should examine it
more closely on the surface.

00:53:04.397 --> 00:53:05.702
Good idea!

00:53:07.889 --> 00:53:09.078
Cam?

00:53:11.073 --> 00:53:13.452
Cam, are you there? Please respond.

00:53:21.931 --> 00:53:24.654
Sorry about that, Sam.
I ran out of ammo and had to hide.

00:53:25.499 --> 00:53:26.688
Copy.

00:53:40.308 --> 00:53:45.410
Colonel, four Ori motherships on sensors.
They are moving to surround us.

00:53:45.487 --> 00:53:47.751
Got it. Jumping to hyperspace.

00:54:01.217 --> 00:54:03.442
<i>Odyssey, this is Teal'c, come in.</i>

00:54:07.087 --> 00:54:09.350
<i>Odyssey, this is Teal'c, come in.</i>

00:54:09.887 --> 00:54:11.038
Teal'c!

00:54:52.588 --> 00:54:54.775
I assume you haven't found
the magic shut-off switch.

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:57.768
No. If the Replicators are gonna
come after the core sooner or later,

00:54:57.883 --> 00:54:59.532
I don't know why they haven't yet.

00:54:59.648 --> 00:55:01.067
Consolidating their numbers?

00:55:01.144 --> 00:55:02.640
Whatever they're trying to do, eventually,

00:55:02.755 --> 00:55:05.518
they're gonna want to take total control
of this ship, and, in order to do that,

00:55:05.594 --> 00:55:06.784
they're going to have to
get into this room.

00:55:06.899 --> 00:55:08.779
We should stop them from doing that.

00:55:08.855 --> 00:55:10.850
I've got people trapped all over the place.

00:55:10.965 --> 00:55:13.498
Replicators have locked down
most of the elevators and bulkheads.

00:55:13.613 --> 00:55:15.032
Trying to restrict crew movements.

00:55:15.147 --> 00:55:17.257
They've also shut down systems
over much of the ship.

00:55:17.334 --> 00:55:19.636
It takes a lot of power to replicate.

00:55:19.751 --> 00:55:23.281
My guess is the queen has set up shop
somewhere close to our main conduit.

00:55:23.396 --> 00:55:25.544
Position all the personnel
you have right here.

00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:27.041
Protect that room at all costs.

00:55:27.156 --> 00:55:28.997
We should probably weld the door shut.

00:55:29.112 --> 00:55:30.378
You won't be able to get out.

00:55:30.455 --> 00:55:32.987
If the Replicators make it into the core,
it's not gonna matter.

00:55:33.102 --> 00:55:36.095
-Do it. I'm gonna go find the queen.
How?

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:40.430
My grandma said,
''You want honey? Follow the bees.''

00:55:40.507 --> 00:55:43.384
Sounds like a good way
of getting stung to me.

00:56:06.097 --> 00:56:07.746
Hey! Hello?

00:56:09.358 --> 00:56:10.931
Let me out of here!

00:56:12.389 --> 00:56:13.578
Anybody!

00:56:14.576 --> 00:56:15.726
Help!

00:57:05.563 --> 00:57:07.021
Daniel Jackson!

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.280
Vala Mal Doran!

00:57:16.804 --> 00:57:20.104
<i>Odyssey, this is Teal'c. Do you read me?</i>

00:57:22.329 --> 00:57:24.976
<i>Odyssey, this is Teal'c. Can you hear me?</i>

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.670
Oh, God.

00:58:56.785 --> 00:59:00.085
Your Gods cannot save you now,
Daniel Jackson.

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:04.535
Actually, that's just
a statement of general dissatisfaction.

01:00:27.558 --> 01:00:29.169
Please, have mercy.

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:52.803
<i>-Enim lupin purnum pravus intus:
-Enim lupin purnum pravus intus:</i>

01:00:52.879 --> 01:00:56.064
<i>-Enim lupin purnum pravus intus:
-Enim lupin purnum pravus intus:</i>

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.670
<i>-Enim lupin purnum pravus intus:
-Enim lupin purnum pravus intus:</i>

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.220
They're coming.

01:02:50.623 --> 01:02:51.697
Carter, I found it.

01:02:52.695 --> 01:02:55.304
<i>It's in an access tube off cargo hold 3:</i>

01:02:55.419 --> 01:02:57.069
That's good. Now get the hell out of there.

01:02:57.145 --> 01:02:58.411
<i>You don't want me to blow it up?</i>

01:02:58.488 --> 01:02:59.601
Not yet.

01:03:05.471 --> 01:03:07.734
It's making more of
those little buggers right now.

01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:09.499
<i>Destroying the queen will likely draw</i>

01:03:09.614 --> 01:03:11.993
<i>any other Replicators onboard
directly to you:</i>

01:03:12.108 --> 01:03:14.717
<i>Not a good plan until
we have a shut-down code:</i>

01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:15.791
Right.

01:03:15.906 --> 01:03:18.093
Besides, they're not
coming after the core just yet.

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.663
When they do, we may need
the distraction to draw them away.

01:03:20.778 --> 01:03:22.006
Copy that.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.522
This program is huge.
It could take weeks to go through.

01:03:46.598 --> 01:03:48.440
-Skim.
-What if I miss it?

01:03:48.517 --> 01:03:49.591
It's a base directive.

01:03:49.668 --> 01:03:51.624
It's like the one that
tells them to replicate, only this one,

01:03:51.739 --> 01:03:55.346
when transmitted on a certain frequency,
will command them to disassemble.

01:03:55.423 --> 01:03:57.072
It should stand out.

01:04:06.433 --> 01:04:07.891
What the hell?

01:04:50.822 --> 01:04:52.587
So much for the rumors.

01:05:30.953 --> 01:05:32.641
-Oh, no.
-What?

01:05:32.718 --> 01:05:35.480
I asked the core to analyze the program,
looking for the shut-down command.

01:05:35.595 --> 01:05:36.708
It says there isn't one.

01:05:36.823 --> 01:05:39.086
-Can we write one?
-Already started.

01:05:41.043 --> 01:05:43.997
<i>Good to see you, Mother:
Or should I call you Vala?</i>

01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:46.913
<i>I believe you renounced our blood relation
last time I saw you:</i>

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:49.253
Seems you have no blood left to speak of.

01:05:49.368 --> 01:05:52.553
<i>You'll be somewhat satisfied to know
that Merlin's weapon did work:</i>

01:05:52.629 --> 01:05:54.739
<i>The Ori were destroyed:</i>

01:05:54.855 --> 01:05:55.967
Really?

01:05:58.231 --> 01:06:00.801
<i>Somehow,
you and your simple human friends</i>

01:06:00.878 --> 01:06:05.021
<i>managed to destroy quite a large group
of very powerful Ascended beings:</i>

01:06:05.098 --> 01:06:06.863
Well, we're a very determined bunch.

01:06:06.978 --> 01:06:10.162
I always say, your never know
what you can do until you try.

01:06:10.277 --> 01:06:11.697
<i>I agree:</i>

01:06:11.812 --> 01:06:14.690
You don't seem too cut up about it.

01:06:14.766 --> 01:06:16.071
<i>No:</i>

01:06:17.452 --> 01:06:19.869
<i>The energy transferred to the Ori
by their human followers</i>

01:06:19.984 --> 01:06:22.286
<i>used to be spread out among many:</i>

01:06:22.401 --> 01:06:26.007
<i>Now that I have Ascended, I get it all:</i>

01:06:26.122 --> 01:06:29.000
If you don't kill us all first.

01:06:29.115 --> 01:06:30.956
<i>It's a shame I can't use
your little discovery</i>

01:06:31.033 --> 01:06:33.680
<i>to convince everyone in your galaxy
to follow me:</i>

01:06:33.796 --> 01:06:35.752
<i>It would be much more humane:</i>

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:39.435
<i>Not as much fun, though:</i>

01:06:39.512 --> 01:06:43.233
Not wanting to give you any ideas,
but why can't you use the Ark?

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:44.806
<i>It's just not the same:</i>

01:06:44.883 --> 01:06:48.298
<i>People need to be convinced
to see me for what I really am:</i>

01:06:48.413 --> 01:06:50.446
A spoiled brat with a God complex?

01:06:50.561 --> 01:06:51.942
<i>Now, Mother:</i>

01:06:52.019 --> 01:06:57.314
The Ark can only be programmed
to make people believe what is true.

01:06:57.429 --> 01:07:01.150
<i>Once the Ancients have been destroyed,
I will be a being of unchallengeable power,</i>

01:07:01.265 --> 01:07:03.759
<i>worshipped by all those beneath me:</i>

01:07:03.874 --> 01:07:07.058
<i>A true God by any definition,
wouldn't you say?</i>

01:07:51.102 --> 01:07:55.131
You know, I think we really...
We got off on the wrong foot.

01:08:04.837 --> 01:08:06.563
Who am I kidding?

01:08:06.679 --> 01:08:09.403
I knew you were an asshole
the moment we met.

01:08:50.645 --> 01:08:53.369
Colonel, we are running out of ammo here.

01:08:57.436 --> 01:08:59.278
Cam, we could really use
that distraction now.

01:09:03.344 --> 01:09:05.762
Roger that, Sam. I'm working on it.

01:09:37.413 --> 01:09:39.715
We're being overrun!
You need to draw them away!

01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:43.935
I'm on it, ASAP.

01:09:46.659 --> 01:09:48.999
You looking for this?

01:09:49.115 --> 01:09:52.145
Wow. Did I drop that?

01:09:52.261 --> 01:09:53.680
I don't suppose
you'd mind flipping that switch

01:09:53.795 --> 01:09:56.059
and blowing us both up, would you?

01:11:18.314 --> 01:11:20.501
Why do you need to take on the Ancients?

01:11:20.616 --> 01:11:23.302
Seriously. How many human worshippers
do you really need?

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:26.295
Can't you just live with what you have
and be happy?

01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:28.443
I mean, my own mother used to say to me,

01:11:28.558 --> 01:11:31.973
''Vala, happiness
is not something you can buy,''

01:11:33.009 --> 01:11:34.773
or, in my case, steal.

01:11:35.771 --> 01:11:36.807
But I think the point is...

01:11:36.883 --> 01:11:38.533
<i>They are a threat to me:</i>

01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:40.490
From what I understand,
they don't even care about you.

01:11:40.567 --> 01:11:42.984
They saw the Ori as a threat
and they did nothing about that.

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:44.480
<i>That's what you chose to believe:</i>

01:11:44.595 --> 01:11:46.705
<i>They gave you the means
to destroy the Ori:</i>

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.777
<i>They'll stop at nothing to destroy me:</i>

01:11:48.892 --> 01:11:53.074
<i>I will not rest until they are
all wiped from existence:</i>

01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:55.989
I wish you hadn't inherited
my determination.

01:12:15.556 --> 01:12:18.472
Sir, long-range sensors just
picked up seven Ori motherships

01:12:18.548 --> 01:12:20.697
exiting hyperspace in our solar system.

01:12:20.812 --> 01:12:23.421
I have Colonel Ellis for you.

01:12:23.536 --> 01:12:26.222
<i>General, we have visual
of enemy contacts:</i>

01:12:26.298 --> 01:12:28.370
<i>They appear to be holding position, sir:</i>

01:12:28.485 --> 01:12:30.442
<i>-For the moment.
-Yes, sir:</i>

01:12:30.518 --> 01:12:32.091
<i>Why do you think that is, sir?</i>

01:12:32.207 --> 01:12:33.703
<i>The weapons platform in Antarctica</i>

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:37.808
<i>is incapable of defending the planet
against seven Ori ships:</i>

01:12:37.885 --> 01:12:39.189
So, why are they waiting?

01:12:39.304 --> 01:12:40.954
<i>Yes, sir:</i>

01:12:41.069 --> 01:12:44.100
I don't know. Just be glad
they're giving us a little more time.

01:12:45.212 --> 01:12:47.207
<i>Sir, given how seriously
outgunned we are,</i>

01:12:47.284 --> 01:12:49.548
<i>I don't see
how a little more time really helps:</i>

01:12:49.625 --> 01:12:52.233
<i>What could possibly save us at this point?</i>

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:55.610
I was hoping SG-1
might show up at some point.

01:12:55.725 --> 01:12:56.684
<i>Yes, sir:</i>

01:12:56.761 --> 01:13:00.213
I'll tell you this much,
we're not going down without a fight.

01:13:00.329 --> 01:13:01.748
Landry out.

01:13:11.109 --> 01:13:12.529
We just dropped out of hyperspace.

01:13:12.644 --> 01:13:15.253
That's funny. I was just thinking
we couldn't get any more screwed.

01:13:15.329 --> 01:13:19.319
The Replicators took back navigation
and hyperdrive control.

01:13:19.435 --> 01:13:21.928
Four Ori motherships
just appeared on sensors.

01:14:16.446 --> 01:14:17.750
Kill me.

01:14:17.827 --> 01:14:19.438
Believe me, I'm trying.

01:14:19.553 --> 01:14:22.277
They did this to get the self-destruct code.

01:14:23.735 --> 01:14:25.462
What is it? Tell me.

01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:27.994
I don't know.

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:30.679
It's on the other side of the crystal.

01:14:51.435 --> 01:14:52.855
<i>It's not over:</i>

01:14:53.891 --> 01:14:55.272
<i>Don't give up:</i>

01:14:57.267 --> 01:14:58.648
You're not Merlin.

01:14:58.725 --> 01:15:00.489
<i>I'm here to help you:</i>

01:15:03.942 --> 01:15:05.937
Then help me.

01:15:06.052 --> 01:15:08.086
<i>You must find the strength:</i>

01:15:20.056 --> 01:15:21.130
No.

01:15:23.816 --> 01:15:24.736
No.

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:29.302
No, I've had it.

01:15:29.417 --> 01:15:32.525
Man, I'm really not in the mood
for games right now.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.164
You're not a figment of my imagination
and you're not Merlin.

01:15:40.159 --> 01:15:42.308
You're Morgan Le Fay.

01:15:42.385 --> 01:15:43.996
<i>You're delirious:</i>

01:15:44.802 --> 01:15:48.638
Merlin died. He didn't Ascend.

01:15:48.715 --> 01:15:52.551
His consciousness left me. It's gone.

01:15:55.429 --> 01:15:57.079
The Ancients must be able
to see through your disguise.

01:15:57.194 --> 01:16:00.838
I know I can, I just don't know
why you think it's necessary.

01:16:04.483 --> 01:16:07.898
<i>You were once Ascended:
You know how complicated it can be:</i>

01:16:08.013 --> 01:16:10.468
<i>Interfering with the lower planes
is not allowed:</i>

01:16:10.545 --> 01:16:13.959
Yeah, I know.
I did it myself more than once.

01:16:14.075 --> 01:16:15.226
Helping me is forbidden,

01:16:15.341 --> 01:16:18.371
and letting me know you're helping me,
well, that's worse.

01:16:18.487 --> 01:16:22.285
<i>I did it once and they stopped me:
I was exiled for it:</i>

01:16:26.275 --> 01:16:28.615
Yet, here you are.

01:16:28.692 --> 01:16:32.759
<i>Merlin saw the Ori for what they were:
He knew they needed to be stopped:</i>

01:16:32.874 --> 01:16:35.789
<i>I was the one who prevented him
from doing it the first time:</i>

01:16:35.905 --> 01:16:40.201
You kept him alive.
You helped us find him.

01:16:40.317 --> 01:16:41.966
<i>I realized he was right:</i>

01:16:42.158 --> 01:16:45.227
The Ori were going
to destroy the Ancients.

01:16:45.342 --> 01:16:48.680
Now, whether they want to admit it
or not, we saved them.

01:16:50.599 --> 01:16:53.054
I think we deserve
the Ancients' help in return.

01:16:53.169 --> 01:16:54.512
<i>So I believe:</i>

01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:57.888
Then help us.

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:02.262
<i>I've done all I can:</i>

01:17:02.377 --> 01:17:06.252
No, you can do more.
You can do much more and you have to.

01:17:07.134 --> 01:17:11.047
<i>Not on my own:
She's too powerful for me:</i>

01:17:12.275 --> 01:17:13.349
She?

01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:20.063
You mean Adria, don't you?

01:17:20.178 --> 01:17:22.480
<i>She took on the mantle of the Ori:</i>

01:17:23.861 --> 01:17:25.051
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

01:17:25.166 --> 01:17:26.892
<i>She has their collective power:</i>

01:17:26.969 --> 01:17:29.041
Then take it away from her.

01:17:30.384 --> 01:17:32.877
And not just for our sake.

01:17:32.992 --> 01:17:34.796
<i>I've distracted her:</i>

01:17:34.872 --> 01:17:40.205
<i>I've helped you when you needed me:
I promise you, Daniel, I've done all I can:</i>

01:17:41.471 --> 01:17:45.845
<i>-No.
-You need only use the Ark on one Prior:</i>

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.840
<i>The crystals in their staffs
are linked to one another:</i>

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:50.295
<i>It's how the Doci communicates
with all at once:</i>

01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:55.897
<i>If you can turn just one of them,
Adria 's power will be greatly diminished:</i>

01:17:56.012 --> 01:17:57.086
How?

01:17:59.158 --> 01:18:00.155
How?

01:18:20.527 --> 01:18:22.561
Carter, I hope you can hear this.

01:18:22.676 --> 01:18:26.436
The self-destruct program
is on the other side of the crystal.

01:18:29.236 --> 01:18:34.224
<i>The program for the self-destruct
is on the other side of the crystal:</i>

01:18:46.616 --> 01:18:47.882
Oh, hell.

01:19:26.248 --> 01:19:27.399
Tomin.

01:19:28.128 --> 01:19:29.662
Tomin, it's Vala.

01:19:30.506 --> 01:19:32.693
No, come on. Come on.

01:19:34.995 --> 01:19:36.184
Come here.

01:19:37.911 --> 01:19:41.287
Listen. Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise.

01:19:44.049 --> 01:19:46.236
Can you pull yourself together?

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.914
Good.
Now I want you to help me find Daniel.

01:19:52.029 --> 01:19:53.449
I'm right here.

01:19:55.904 --> 01:19:57.477
Are you guys okay?

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:59.395
I don't feel very good.

01:20:01.889 --> 01:20:03.501
Let's find the Ark.

01:20:48.734 --> 01:20:50.230
Oh, give me a break.

01:22:01.628 --> 01:22:04.812
Shields are at 18%.
Hyperdrive is still offline.

01:22:05.618 --> 01:22:07.345
Then she just
suddenly disappeared somewhere

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.723
as if she had something
really important to do,

01:22:09.838 --> 01:22:10.759
and when I turned around,

01:22:10.874 --> 01:22:12.524
about seven symbols on the Ark
were glowing.

01:22:12.639 --> 01:22:13.905
It was Morgan.

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.555
Is she helping?
Because if she is, I don't understand.

01:22:15.632 --> 01:22:17.473
Which seven symbols?

01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:18.739
Well, you don't expect me to remember?

01:22:19.008 --> 01:22:20.274
With the fate of two galaxies
hanging in the balance,

01:22:20.389 --> 01:22:22.115
yes, I expect you to remember
the essential clue given to you

01:22:22.192 --> 01:22:24.647
-by a powerful Ascended being!
-It's not that it was glowing for that long.

01:22:24.763 --> 01:22:26.527
It was more like a bright light.
When I turned around, realized

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:28.331
-I was alone and went to look for you.
-Which ones?

01:22:29.366 --> 01:22:32.704
One here, two here,
two here, and two there.

01:22:32.819 --> 01:22:33.778
Did they come in any order?

01:22:33.894 --> 01:22:35.965
-No, all at once.
-Of course.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.768
Someone is coming.

01:22:39.073 --> 01:22:40.301
Okay, seven symbols.

01:22:40.416 --> 01:22:41.758
Just make a guess.

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.677
<i>Verimas is truth in Ancient.</i>

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:44.943
Good.

01:22:47.974 --> 01:22:49.163
Two there.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.146
I guess not.

01:23:28.449 --> 01:23:30.253
<i>This is Colonel Mitchell
of the Earth ship Odyssey:</i>

01:23:30.329 --> 01:23:35.547
We surrender. Please, cease fire.
Repeat, we surrender.

01:23:38.463 --> 01:23:41.417
Sam, I don't think they're gonna stop.

01:23:41.532 --> 01:23:43.335
I'm not going to get
the hyperdrive back in time.

01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:45.330
We can't take much more.

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:56.993
<i>It's over:</i>

01:23:57.108 --> 01:23:58.643
<i>You can't win:</i>

01:23:58.758 --> 01:24:01.290
<i>There is only one path:</i>

01:24:01.405 --> 01:24:04.436
<i>The power and glory of Origin:</i>

01:24:15.294 --> 01:24:19.169
Adria. I'm sorry.

01:24:20.166 --> 01:24:21.547
I wish things could have been different.

01:24:21.662 --> 01:24:22.813
<i>Me too:</i>

01:24:24.425 --> 01:24:26.458
So, what are you gonna do?

01:24:27.379 --> 01:24:29.873
We're obviously never going to agree.

01:24:31.561 --> 01:24:33.671
Are you gonna kill me now?

01:25:29.838 --> 01:25:32.485
<i>No! You can't take away my power:</i>

01:25:36.897 --> 01:25:39.122
I think we just did.

01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:44.263
<i>You will all burn in the fires
of eternal damnation:</i>

01:25:47.218 --> 01:25:49.481
<i>Not if I have anything to do with it:</i>

01:25:49.596 --> 01:25:51.361
<i>You're no match for me:</i>

01:25:53.279 --> 01:25:54.622
<i>I am now:</i>

01:26:22.053 --> 01:26:25.583
<i>Mia clementia denar esto:</i>

01:26:26.235 --> 01:26:27.386
What?

01:26:28.499 --> 01:26:30.839
What did he say? I don't understand.

01:26:31.491 --> 01:26:33.103
He said, ''Have mercy.

01:26:34.177 --> 01:26:36.441
''I was blind, but now I see.''

01:26:50.022 --> 01:26:51.019
Sam?

01:26:53.168 --> 01:26:54.242
Why did they stop?

01:26:54.357 --> 01:26:56.391
<i>I don't know:</i>

01:26:56.467 --> 01:26:58.232
But I'm glad they did.

01:27:00.688 --> 01:27:01.800
Ow...

01:27:08.859 --> 01:27:10.970
It was Origin.

01:27:11.085 --> 01:27:12.274
What was?

01:27:14.116 --> 01:27:17.146
The key word that activated the Ark.

01:27:17.262 --> 01:27:18.297
I realized while Adria was talking,

01:27:18.412 --> 01:27:19.448
the Ancient version of the word
also means ''truth'' in older dialects.

01:27:19.448 --> 01:27:22.249
the Ancient version of the word
also means ''truth'' in older dialects.

01:27:22.326 --> 01:27:26.201
I guess the Alteran that built it
must have thought it was ironic.

01:27:30.689 --> 01:27:34.334
You know, I'm starting to think
that irony is very overrated.

01:27:53.364 --> 01:27:55.128
Have you reconsidered?

01:27:55.665 --> 01:27:56.701
No.

01:28:03.761 --> 01:28:05.679
I do not understand.

01:28:06.868 --> 01:28:08.173
Take it.

01:28:15.232 --> 01:28:17.342
We have something to show you.

01:28:25.053 --> 01:28:27.202
What is the meaning of this?

01:28:27.317 --> 01:28:28.775
See for yourself.

01:28:44.965 --> 01:28:47.421
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.567
-How'd it go?
-Worked like a charm.

01:28:50.682 --> 01:28:51.679
Daniel was right.

01:28:51.794 --> 01:28:54.096
The Priors' staffs did all seem
to be connected somehow.

01:28:54.173 --> 01:28:55.784
Within each galaxy.

01:28:55.899 --> 01:28:58.201
Yeah, I mean, whatever subspace link
connects them

01:28:58.278 --> 01:29:00.503
was obviously somewhat limited.

01:29:00.618 --> 01:29:02.498
Still, when Daniel opened the Ark
for the Prior that was here,

01:29:02.613 --> 01:29:04.493
everyone seemed to get the message.

01:29:04.570 --> 01:29:06.642
-The ships backed off?
-Yep.

01:29:06.718 --> 01:29:08.598
Sorry I missed it.

01:29:08.675 --> 01:29:09.980
How are you doing?

01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:12.742
You know, I've felt worse.

01:29:14.276 --> 01:29:16.463
Well, apparently,
when you're feeling better,

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.343
the IOA wants to meet with you.

01:29:18.458 --> 01:29:20.415
Really?

01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:22.448
Mmm-hmm. Something about an apology.

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:27.436
I don't know,
my recovery could take a while.

01:29:27.551 --> 01:29:29.546
Yeah. Not too long, I hope.

01:29:29.661 --> 01:29:31.119
-No!
-Oh! Sorry.

01:29:31.196 --> 01:29:35.071
That's okay.
I guess maybe that hurts a little.

01:29:35.186 --> 01:29:37.679
I'll let you rest.

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.368
Yeah. Okay.

01:29:41.938 --> 01:29:43.741
-Sam.
-Yeah?

01:29:44.662 --> 01:29:47.961
-What's in the bag?
-Oh, my God, I almost forgot.

01:29:49.343 --> 01:29:51.146
I baked these for you.

01:30:00.277 --> 01:30:01.620
Macaroons.

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:04.305
I'm sure they're not as good
as your grandma's.

01:30:04.382 --> 01:30:05.763
Nice recall.

01:30:09.523 --> 01:30:10.827
Cheek okay?

01:30:12.132 --> 01:30:13.206
Yeah.

01:30:28.284 --> 01:30:29.204
Mmm.

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.261
You're going to make a great leader.

01:30:40.062 --> 01:30:42.556
When I was being tortured by the Prior,

01:30:42.632 --> 01:30:45.932
the teachings of Origin
gave me the strength I needed.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:55.485
There are still so many things about it
that mean a great deal to me.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.825
I don't doubt that there is morality
and wisdom in it.

01:30:57.902 --> 01:31:01.738
That's what made it such a powerful lure
for so many people.

01:31:01.853 --> 01:31:04.347
I think, in principle,
the idea of bettering ourselves,

01:31:04.424 --> 01:31:09.066
and seeking Ascension
in one way or another,

01:31:11.023 --> 01:31:13.670
is what it's all really about.

01:31:13.785 --> 01:31:16.087
The book just needs some revision.

01:31:18.236 --> 01:31:22.110
Well, that's entirely up to you
and your people,

01:31:22.916 --> 01:31:25.832
though I might humbly recommend
that the part about burning people alive

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:29.553
for not following along
should be the first bit to go.

01:31:29.668 --> 01:31:32.162
Perhaps throw in some color pictures.

01:31:37.111 --> 01:31:40.641
You know, I have not asked
because I fear I know the answer.

01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:43.135
But now that I'm leaving...

01:31:46.396 --> 01:31:49.619
I don't exactly know
where my place is,

01:31:51.115 --> 01:31:52.956
but I hope it's here.

01:31:55.949 --> 01:31:57.330
I'm sorry.

01:31:58.941 --> 01:32:02.241
I know I'll never make up
for the things I've done,

01:32:03.123 --> 01:32:06.538
but I promise you,
I'll spend the rest of my life trying.

01:32:08.034 --> 01:32:09.185
I know.

01:32:14.671 --> 01:32:15.976
So will I.

01:32:17.856 --> 01:32:18.815
I know I was the one who found it.

01:32:18.892 --> 01:32:21.347
I'm not entirely happy about the fact
that we were forced to use it either,

01:32:21.462 --> 01:32:22.728
but I think it was better
than the alternative.

01:32:22.805 --> 01:32:24.071
No one disagrees with you.

01:32:24.148 --> 01:32:26.795
But it is a very dangerous piece
of technology to keep lying around.

01:32:26.872 --> 01:32:28.099
It's out of my hands, Dr. Jackson.

01:32:28.176 --> 01:32:29.979
Okay. Let's say someone does figure out
how to reprogram it,

01:32:30.094 --> 01:32:31.706
or, worse, let's say,
it falls into the wrong hands,

01:32:31.821 --> 01:32:33.969
it could be the most powerful
weapon we've ever come across.

01:32:34.084 --> 01:32:37.384
I'm well aware of the risk
and so is the IOA.

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:42.563
For now, the Ark is being studied
at Area 51. That's all I know.

01:32:45.249 --> 01:32:48.586
I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson.
I've done all I can do.

01:32:56.912 --> 01:32:59.521
It's kind of weird not having
a big, bad guy to fight anymore.

01:32:59.636 --> 01:33:01.631
Yeah. That's how we felt
when we defeated the Goa'uld

01:33:01.746 --> 01:33:03.741
and the Replicators the first time.

01:33:03.856 --> 01:33:06.311
Well, Jackson and Vala took care of that.

01:33:06.388 --> 01:33:08.191
That whole Ori thing was not our fault.

01:33:08.306 --> 01:33:10.647
Just take the blame. You get used to it.

01:33:10.762 --> 01:33:12.565
We played a big part
in fixing the problem.

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:13.678
That you did.

01:33:13.793 --> 01:33:16.977
There are still many planets in
our gate system that remain unexplored.

01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:20.238
Yes, let's see what mysteries
P3K-546 will hold.

01:33:20.353 --> 01:33:21.619
And what treasure.

01:33:21.734 --> 01:33:23.307
I'm sure something will come up.

01:33:23.384 --> 01:33:24.842
Walter, hit it.

01:36:29.638 --> 01:36:30.562
