00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.350
Hello?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.530
Nancy?

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.610
Nancy!

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.450
Hello?

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.090
Oh, my God...

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.140
Nancy!

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.350
Hey, what's the matter?

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.440
Nothing.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.590
You're so beautiful.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.350
Nancy!

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.490
Steve?

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.500
- Hey, Steve.
- Mmm.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.250
I'll...

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.300
see you tomorrow, okay?

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.430
Mmm-hmm.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.630
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.880
Oh, I scared you?

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.170
I know, I should have called.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.840
Where have you been?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.380
We agreed on 10:00.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.430
After the assembly, some people
wanted to get something to eat.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.576
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.770
You didn't think to call and let me know?

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.520
With everything that's been going on?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.350
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.190
I'm sorry, Mom.
What more do you want?

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.570
Hey, wait...

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.820
Whose sweatshirt is that?

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.570
Steve's.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.360
Steve's.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.756
So is Steve your boyfriend now?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.070
What?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160
No!

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.290
It was just cold,
so I borrowed his sweatshirt.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.620
It's not a big deal.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.870
Nancy?

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.540
What?

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.000
You can talk to me.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.970
You can talk to me.
Whatever happened.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.760
Nothing happened.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.760
Nancy.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.680
Nothing happened.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.150
Can I please go?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.010
Will? Will?

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.760
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.840
Will...

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.180
Please...

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.890
Will...

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.980
It's me.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.560
It's me. Just talk to me.
Talk to me.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.650
Just say...

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.900
- Mom?
- Jonathan!

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.860
- Come here. Come here.
- Mom, what is this?

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.490
Come here. Come here.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.910
- What's going on?
- It's Will. It's Will, he's...

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.830
he's trying to talk to me.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.000
- He's trying to talk to you?
- Yes, through... through the lights.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.210
- Mom...
- I know.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.670
I know.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.880
Just... just watch.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.550
Will... your brother's here.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.430
Can you show him what you showed me, baby?

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.310
Please...
Did you see that?

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.350
It's the electricity, Mom.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.746
- It's acting up.
- No.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.410
It's the same thing that fried the phone.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.980
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.280
Something is going on here!

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.990
- Yesterday, the wall...
- What? What about the wall?

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.296
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.700
I just know that Will is here.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.280
No, Mom.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.040
- Maybe if I get more lamps...
- No, Mom.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.540
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay?

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.790
He is just lost.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.960
People are looking for him,
and they're going to find him.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.630
Okay.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.930
- This isn't helping.
- Okay, okay.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.300
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.640
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.480
Can you just try and get some sleep?

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.230
- Yeah.
- Huh? Can you do that for me?

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.560
- I promise. I will.
- Yeah?

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.610
- Yeah.
- I just need to sit here for a minute.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.570
All right, I'll go make breakfast.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.150
- Okay.
- Yeah?

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.750
Will?

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.840
We just tell our parents
we have AV Club after school.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.510
That'll give us at least a few hours
for Operation Mirkwood.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.130
You seriously think that
the weirdo knows where Will is?

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.930
- Just trust me on this, okay?
- Okay.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.510
- Did you get the supplies?
- Yeah.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.220
Binoculars... from 'Nam.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.480
Army knife... also from 'Nam.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.020
Hammer, camouflage bandana...

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.270
and the wrist rocket.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.416
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon
with a slingshot?

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.900
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.320
And second of all,
the Demogorgon's not real.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.410
It's made up.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.740
But if there is something out there,
I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.500
- and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get?

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.580
Well, alrighty.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.920
So, we've got...

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.380
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.010
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.260
- banana, and trail mix.
- Seriously?

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.850
We need energy for our travels.
For stamina.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.060
And besides, why do we
even need weapons anyway?

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.770
- We have her.
- She shut one door!

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.020
With her mind!

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.770
Are you kidding me?
That's insane!

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.730
Imagine all the other cool stuff
she could do.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.900
Like...

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.450
I bet... that she could make this fly!

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.160
Hey. Hey.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.830
Okay, concentrate.
Okay?

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.210
Okay, one more time.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.540
Okay.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.340
Use your powers, okay?

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.420
Idiot.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.180
- She's not a dog!
- Boys!

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.010
Time for school!

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.220
Just stay down here.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.560
Don't make any noise,
and don't leave.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.100
If you get hungry,
eat Dustin's snacks, okay?

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.060
- Michael!
- Coming!

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.520
You know those power lines?

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.400
- Power lines?
- Yeah.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.520
The ones behind my house?

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.820
Yes.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.440
Meet us there, after school.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.200
After school?

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.610
Yeah, 3:15.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.830
Ah.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.500
When the numbers read three-one-five,
meet us there.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.800
"Three-one-five."

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.840
Three-one-five.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.410
Hey!

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.580
Hey!

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.160
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.700
Yeah, totally.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.790
I just...

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.210
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.800
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.130
I know.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.050
I know.
Of course not.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.680
But what about, like, Tommy,
and Carol and them?

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.850
You're being paranoid.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.310
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, it's cute.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.520
Hey...

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.270
I had a good time.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.320
Yeah.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.110
Yeah.
Me, too.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.080
Mmm.
Hmm.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.560
Hey, Ally.
Where's Barb?

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.480
Um, shouldn't you know?

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.730
You haven't seen her anywhere...
at all?

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.990
There she is.
Emerald City.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.200
I heard they make
space weapons in there.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280
Space weapons?

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.490
Yeah. You know, like,
Reagan's Star Wars.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.250
I guess we're gonna blow
the Ruskies to smithereens.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.700
Hey, can I help you?

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.630
Uh, yeah.
We're here for a tour.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.500
Oh, we don't give tours.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.630
Okay...
A quick look around.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.340
You have to get clearance for that.
You can contact, uh...

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.066
Rick Schaeffer
at the Department of Energy.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.236
Maybe you seen it on TV.
We got a local kid that's missing.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.156
We have reason to believe
he might have snuck in here.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.640
Like I said,
you have to speak to Mr. Schaeffer.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.940
- What's your name?
- Patrick.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.610
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor,
and I got reporters breathing down my neck

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.280
and I got a very upset mother.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.870
Now, I know the kid's not in there,
but I gotta check off this box.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.160
Patrick, would you do me a favor?

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.790
Would you speak to your boss
and see what you can swing for us?

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.380
I'd really appreciate it.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.340
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.490

- Joyce...
- Just ring me up, Donald.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.500
And you think this missing boy
may have crawled through there?

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.210
Well, that was the idea.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.710
Yeah, I just don't see
how that'd be possible.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.500
We've got over 100 cameras.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.220
Every square inch covered,
plus all my guys.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.380
No one breaks in here.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.090
Certainly not some kid.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.600
Those cameras, you keep the tapes?

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.626
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you guys do in here?

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.400
You're asking the wrong guy.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.530
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians?
- I expect. Something like that.

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.030
- Who's in charge here?
- That'd be Dr. Brenner.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.990
And he builds the space lasers?

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.910
- Space lasers?
- Ignore him.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.000
This is the night of the 6th and 7th
we're seeing here?

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.410
That's correct.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.550
Is that it?

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.560
Like I said, we would have seen him.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.020
The night of the 7th,
we had a search party out for Will.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.810
You remember anything about that night?

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.150
Mmm, not much to remember.
Called it off.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.820
- 'Cause of the storm.
- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.570
You see any rain on that tape?

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.200
What are you thinking?

00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.830
I don't know.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.040
But they're lying.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.330
That's why science doesn't
make any damn sense to me.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.080
No, I swear. Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.370
Oh, thanks, man.
It's a heated pool.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.290
Well, if it's not frostbite,
then what is it?

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.210
Ugh, I don't care what it is,
it's disgusting!

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.000
Get it off the table.
We're eating here.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.380
Ew!

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.090
Hey, Tommy.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.050
When you left, did you see Barb?

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.550
- What?
- Barbara.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.100
She's not here today.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.310
I seriously have no idea
who you're talking about.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.560
Come on, don't be an ass, man.
Did you...

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.480
Did you see her leave last night or not?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.190
No, she was gone when we left.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.740
Probably couldn't stand
listening to all that moaning.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.660
Oh, Steve!

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.160
- Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve!
- Oh, Steve...

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.330
Oh, Steve!

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.056
Okay, chill.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.000
Listen... I'm sure she's fine.
She's probably just...

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.590
she's probably just, like,
skipping or something.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.090
Yeah.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.760
Yeah, probably.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.070
- How about this one?
- Too big for the sling.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.410
So, do you think Eleven was born
with her powers, like the X-Men,

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.790
or do you think she acquired them, like...
like Green Lantern?

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.000
She's not a superhero.
She's a weirdo.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.500
Why does that matter?
The X-Men are weirdos.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.040
If you love her so much,
why don't you marry her?

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.460
What are you talking about?

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.050
- Mike, seriously?
- What?

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.170
You look at her all, like...

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.720
"Hi, El! El! El! El!

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.180
I love you so much!

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.156
- Would you marry me?"
- Shut up, Lucas.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.680
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.520
What are you losers
doing back here?

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.206
Probably looking for their missing friend.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.150
That's not funny.
It's serious. He's in danger.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.400
I hate to break it to you, Toothless,
but he's not in danger.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.860
He's dead.
That's what my dad says.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.240
He said he was probably killed
by some other queer.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.410
Come on.
Just ignore them.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.290
Watch where you're going, Frogface.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.630
- You all right?
- Yeah.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.930
Hey.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.510
How about this one?

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.100
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.600
Yeah, this is it.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.600
Oh, yeah.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.060
Yeah, this is the monster killer!

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.190
Whoo!

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.420
Hey.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.130
Oh, hey.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.260
- Hey!
- Hey, Karen.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.350
Hi...

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:38.970
I brought you a casserole.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.190
Oh! Thank you, uh...

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.810
Uh, you wanna... come in?

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.170
Hey, Marissa.
How you doin'?

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.630
You have a lot of nerve showing up here.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.050
What?

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.130
You could have at least called, said,

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.680
"Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out.
Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.260
Yep.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.310
I'm sorry. Uh...

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.770
Maybe we could go out again next week?

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.400
Newspapers?
You guys got newspapers around here?

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.910
We have the <i>New York Times,</i>
the <i>Post,</i> all the big ones.

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.530
Organized by year and topic.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.330
You can find the corresponding microfiche
in the reading room.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.210
Okay, we're looking for anything
on the Hawkins National Laboratory.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.106
Well, shouldn't you be looking
for that missing kid?

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.290
Yeah. We are.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.340
Uh, so, why don't you start
with the <i>Times,</i>

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.840
and we'll check out the <i>Post.</i>

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.390
The librarian?

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.900
Will always loved
Christmas, you know.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.280
So I thought if I...
I put the lights up...

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.950
I don't know, he...

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.700
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.280
It's silly, I know.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.410
No.
No, it's not silly.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.500
How is Jonathan holding up?

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.540
You know,
he's good at taking care of himself.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.580
He always has been, you know?

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:11.920
I...

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.170
I mean,
he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.800
Is something the matter?

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.220
Uh, no.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.550
No, I just...

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.850
We're having electrical problems.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.060
Joyce.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.560
I want you to know something.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.770
If you need anything, anything at all...

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.400
Ted and I are here for you.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.520
Thank you.
Thanks.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:35.900
Okay.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.740
How... how's Mike
dealing with this?

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.610
Is he, uh, okay?

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.660
Mike?
Uh... I don't know.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.290
He skipped school yesterday.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.330
He's never done anything like that before.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.950
Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.130
Oh, where's Holly?

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.430
Hey!

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.180
She shouldn't be here.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.770
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's quite the explorer these days.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.110
- Wait, did you see something?
- Yeah.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.860
What did... what did you see?
Tell me.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.820
- What did you see? What...
- Joyce... Joyce!

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.780
Listen... Karen,
thank you for the casserole,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.120
but I need you to leave.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:07.910
Okay?

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.500
Come on, come on, come on...

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.540
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.500
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:18.960
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.090
<i>Good.
I'm good.</i>

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:23.380
Um, I was just wondering, uh,
is Barb there?

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.430
<i>Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.</i>

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.890
But she did come home, right?
After the vigil?

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.230
No, she said she was staying
with you last night.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:36.100
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.360
I meant, did she come home this morning?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.610
I think she left some textbooks
and she was gonna go pick them up.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.900
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.910
Do... Do you know what?
I just remembered... she's at the library.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:53.620
Nancy, will you please have her call me
as soon as you find her?

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.670
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.080
Sorry to bother you.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.140
Hey, man.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.270
What's going on?

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.350
Nicole here was, uh,
telling us about your work.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.786
- We've heard great things.
- Yeah, sounds cool.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.530
And we'd just love to take a look.
You know, as... connoisseurs of art.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.570
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.926
- Oh, no? Oh...
- Hey.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.160
Please, give me my bag.
No, just...

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.756
Man, he is totally trembling.
He must really have something to hide.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.040
Here we go.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.830
Ah...

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:34.910
Here we go.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.710
- Oh, man.
- Let me see.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.540
Dude.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.606
Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.316
- I was looking for my brother.
- No.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.090
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.430
- What's going on?
- Here's the starring lady.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.640
What?

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.770
This creep was spying on us last night.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.100
He was probably gonna
save this one for later.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:06.650
See, you can tell
that he knows it was wrong, but...

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.780
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.820
It's hardwired into 'em.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.790
You know, they just can't help themselves.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.750
So...

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.540
we'll just have to take away his toy.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.750
- Steve...
- No, please, not the camera.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.550
No, no, wait, wait...
Tommy, Tommy.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.550
It's okay.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.640
Here you go, man.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.520
Come on, let's go.
The game's about to start.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.230
Boo.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.610
Bye.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.160
Hey, Nance!

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.500
Come on.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.360
Three-one-five.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.030
Three-one-five.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.320
Three-one-five.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:43.020
No! No!

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.390
Papa! Papa!

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.770
Papa!

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.940
Papa!

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.320
Papa!

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.990
No!

00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:47.500
Incredible.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.720
El!

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.220
You okay?

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.600
Hop on.
We only have a few hours.

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:04.080
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.240
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.700
blow me."

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:11.186
Bull, if you did that,
you'd be in detention right now.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:12.670
Saturday.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.540
I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.790
Oh, he's so a virgin!

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.760
Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.840
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.430
I totally forgot.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.100
I told my mom I would, um...

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.640
I would do something with her.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.656
Well, what do you mean?
The game's about to start.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.140
I'm sorry.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.150
What the hell's wrong with her?

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.190
Maybe she freaked out
when you went all psycho on the psycho.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.280
Oh, give me a break.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.650
What'd you expect,
dating Miss Perfect?

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.660
Why did they hurt you?

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:51.870
What?

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.460
Oh, that.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.540
Uh...

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.300
I just fell at recess.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.420
- Mike...
- Yeah?

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.970
Friends tell the truth.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.010
I was tripped by this mouth breather,
Troy, okay?

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.560
Mouth breather?

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.560
Yeah, you know...

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.770
a dumb person.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:15.020
A knucklehead.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.190
Knucklehead?

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.900
I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.820
I just didn't want you to think
I was such a wastoid, you know?

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.030
- Mike...
- Yeah?

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.620
I understand.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:29.950
Oh.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.790
Okay, cool.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:33.080
Cool.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:56.480
Barb?

00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.980
Barb!

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.710
Barb?

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.720
Barb?

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.490
Barb?

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:53.490
Oh!

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.570
Will... are you here?

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.030
Okay, good, good, good, good.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:15.990
Are you...

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.120
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.670
Can you do that for me,
sweetie?

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:23.790
Can you do...

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.590
Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.800
Baby, I need to know...

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:35.430
Are you alive?

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:44.690
Are you safe?

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.120
I need to know where to find you, honey.
Where... where are you?

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.670
Can you...
can you tell me where you are?

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.080
Can you...

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.750
Please, baby.
I need to find you. Tell me what to do.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.720
Please just...

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.140
Will...

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.290
Hey! You're home early!
How was the game?

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.710
Nancy?
What's the matter?

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.880
It's Barb.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.180
I think...

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.470
something happened.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:01.470
Something terrible.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.890
<i>I don't know, Chief.</i>

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.230
What don't you know?

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.480
This lady, Terry Ives,
sounds like a real nut to me.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.610
Her kid was taken
for LSD mind control experiments?

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:14.780
She's been discredited.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.006
Claim was thrown out...

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:17.160
Okay, forget about her.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.490
Take a look at this.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.790
- Dr. Martin Brenner.
- Who?

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:23.500
Brenner.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.500
He runs Hawkins Lab.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.620
Okay.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.210
You don't find that interesting?

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.710
Not really.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.670
He was involved in some hippie crap
back in the day, so what?

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.930
No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:41.140
Doesn't mean he had
anything to do with our kid.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.220
Come on. Look at that.
Hospital gowns. All of 'em.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.576
Now, that piece of fabric
that the teacher found by the pipe.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.520
That sure looked
like a hospital gown to me, huh?

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.020
- Am I wrong?
- I don't know, Chief.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.440
Come on, man.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.820
Work with me here.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.490
I'm not saying that there's
some grand conspiracy.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:58.820
I'm just...

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.950
I'm saying maybe something happened.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.880
Maybe Will was in the wrong place
at the wrong time

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.880
and he saw something
that he shouldn't have.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.630
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.260
<i>Hey, Powell,
is the chief with you?</i>

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.550
Hopper here.
What do you got?

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.180
Here.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.810
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:09.430
Hiding.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.150
No, no, this is where he lives.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.230
He's missing from here.
Understand?

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.800
- What are we doing here?
- She said he's hiding here.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.570
Um... no!

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.320
I swear, if we walked
all the way out here for nothing...

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.910
That's exactly what we did.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.040
I told you she didn't know
what the hell she was talking about!

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.830
Why did you bring us here?

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.130
- Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then?

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:36.856
Call the cops,
like we should have done yesterday.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.526
- We are not calling the cops!
- Hey, guys?

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.760
- What other choice do we have?
- Guys!

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:50.680
Will...

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:10.000
Okay.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.410
Okay, baby, talk to me.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.210
Talk to me.
Where are you?

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.880
"R." Good, good, good, good.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.340
That's good.
Come on, come on.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.170
"I...

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.380
G...

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:25.140
H... T...

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.100
H...

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.180
E...

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:30.310
R... E..."

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:31.980
"Right here."

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.100
"Right here"?

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.860
I don't know what that means.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:39.230
I need you to tell me what to do.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.320
What should I do?

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.650
How do I get to you? How do I find you?
What should I do?

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.140
Oh, Jesus.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.400
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:33.350
It's not Will.
It can't be.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:44.480
It's Will.
It's really Will.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.410
Mike...

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:54.660
"Mike"? "Mike," what?

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.870
You were supposed to help us
find him alive.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.370
You said he was alive!

00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.870
Why did you lie to us?

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.170
What's wrong with you?

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.000
What is wrong with you?

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:06.300
- Mike...
- What?

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:12.220
Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.350
Mike...

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:16.100
Mike, where are you going?
Mike!

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.270
Mike!

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.280
Mom?

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:38.250
Mom, what happened?

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:39.580
It's okay.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:41.920
Hey.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:48.510
Michael?

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.470
What's wrong?
