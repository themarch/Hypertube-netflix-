00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.202
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.901
<i>you are about to see</i>
<i>an unforgettable show:</i>

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.502
<i>A film destined to become immortal,</i>

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.673
<i>as immortal as the music</i>
<i>which will follow,</i>

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.547
<i>and which will be interpreted</i>
<i>through animation.</i>

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.617
<i>Beginning with his childhood fantasies,</i>

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.815
<i>the greatest ambition</i>
<i>that burns and swells</i>

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.155
<i>within the soul of every creative animator</i>

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.251
<i>is to illustrate music,</i>

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.694
<i>to give visual form and color to its notes.</i>

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.224
<i>With this film</i>
<i>we have finally succeeded</i>

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:47.699
<i>in achieving this union</i>
<i>of animation and classical music,</i>

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.866
<i>a union we are sure is destined</i>

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:52.809
<i>to live on throughout the history of film.</i>

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.246
<i>A new and original film</i>

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.476
that has even astonished us,

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.485
the men responsible,

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:04.216
the men who, quite modestly speaking,
can be called its creators.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:08.590
A film in which... in which...

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:12.256
A film in which you will <i>see</i> the music
and <i>listen</i> to the drawings.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.562
You might call it a film of magic,
a fantasia.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.798
Hello?

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.575
Yes. Who's speaking?

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.205
Who is this?
What do you mean, who am I?

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.905
Who is it you wish to speak to?

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:32.180
California?

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.684
It's Hollywood.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:36.619
Hello! Yes.

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:39.590
What? You've already...

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.626
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.719
You've already done this?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.527
Look, if this is some kind of joke,
I'm in no mood...

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:51.932
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:53.972
You're very ill-mannered.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:57.236
That's right...
ill-mannered and a liar!

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.208
Yes, I said you're a liar!

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.041
A liar from California!

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.750
It's nothing. They're mad.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.512
Mad as hatters.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.313
They insist that our film...

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.083
this is all so ridiculous...

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.625
was already made
by a certain fellow years ago.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:18.891
A certain someone
by the name of Prisney or Grisney.

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:19.987
Some American.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.100
In any case,

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:26.605
before you go around opening
your big mouth, see the film first!

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.504
Where were we?

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.446
Settle down now.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.488
Damned hags!

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.794
What's this racket?

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.396
Calm down!

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.704
All right, let's go.

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:10.014
Hurry up! No time to lose.
The film's already started.

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.981
Run!

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.943
Move it!

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.389
Get the lead out!

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.957
Come on!

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.191
Get in the car.

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:25.691
It's time you earned your keep.

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.823
We haven't kept you here
out of charity!

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.661
Where are our instruments?

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.036
They're already at the theater,
along with your clothes.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:36.972
Hold on tight when we get moving.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.111
You wouldn't want to hurt yourself
now of all times, would you?

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.820
Pisney has already done this?

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:57.920
Let's go!

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:08.770
Hiring an orchestra wasn't a problem.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.740
But the principle challenge
that remained

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:15.041
was to secure the creative
collaboration of a true artist.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.514
A free artist.

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:21.815
Free of all conditioning,
free of all compromise,

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:26.085
an animator capable
of independent self-expression.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:33.423
How's it going?
You look more cheerful than usual.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:36.263
You knew this was your big day, huh?
Tell the truth.

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:37.893
You knew it!

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.570
<i>Finding the ideal artist to create</i>
<i>our animation was no small task.</i>

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:49.045
<i>We had to bind him</i>...
<i>bind him to ourselves</i>

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:54.085
<i>in a contract based on trust</i>
<i>and mutual respect.</i>

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.456
Come on, now.

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:01.186
After five years hanging around,
you can't be tired!

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.125
That's good.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.662
On your feet.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:22.305
Hurry, the orchestra's waiting.
Can't you hear it?

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:24.310
Let's go!

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:38.192
Wash your dentures
if you want to play trombone.

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.527
Kick the drums, not me, thank you.

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:43.602
- I'll do whatever I want.
- Kick her!

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:46.763
If they hadn't put me in the first row,
I wouldn't have done it.

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:49.603
I made it clear
I wouldn't do nude scenes.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:57.139
Where are you going?

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.686
The movie world is dreadful.

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.696
I've always defended my virtue.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:19.371
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.201
This has never been done...
Just a moment.

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:24.367
And so it's come! The great moment...
I said wait a minute.

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:32.075
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.812
The only thing missing now

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.388
is the orchestra conductor!

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:53.332
Girls, babes, beauties,

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:59.400
let's get started with Debussy's
<i>Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.</i>

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.639
A wonderful piece!

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:05.080
There'll certainly be lots
to inspire our artist's imagination

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:08.082
as he renders this music
in visual form

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:10.755
and gives it new life.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:17.228
Yes, relying on nothing more
than his trusty pencil,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.527
I'm sure he'll succeed
in bringing new life...

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:25.531
in bringing new life
to this great piece of music.

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:41.016
The artist creates!

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.967
Ready, girls?

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:02.338
The Debussy piece!

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:02.367
Good. Really great.

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:15.177
Sit down or I'll hang you
back on the wall!

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:17.118
Sit down!

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:19.486
I did not enjoy that.

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:22.252
You didn't entertain me!

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.666
Quite an afternoon, eh?

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:00.255
Granny!

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.127
How do you feel?

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:08.664
A bit scattered, maestro.

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:11.504
Pick up all the pieces,
and don't miss any!

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:19.115
Cheer up!

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.083
Everything's all right.

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:25.350
I'm feeling a bit scattered,
maestro.

00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:28.352
How's it going, girls?

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.984
Everyone all right?

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:33.464
Suppose we try
some simple exercises.

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:38.826
Stand up...

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.706
and sit down.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.169
And up...

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.544
and down again.

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:12.161
Hey, you there.

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:14.138
Me?

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:17.107
Come with me for a minute.

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.701
Do as he says.

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:26.816
Come along, granny.

00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:28.317
You look a little pale,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.218
and your reflexes are a bit impaired.

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:34.383
It's nothing.
You'll get over it.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:44.591
It's not easy maintaining order
in an orchestra.

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:48.739
It calls for an iron fist in a velvet -

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:53.435
Glove! An iron first
in a velvet glove.

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:02.348
Girls, our second piece

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:04.945
will be Dvorak's <i>Slavic Dance No. 7.</i>

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:07.116
Mind you, the tempo is allegro.

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:02.622
Poor guy hasn't even noticed yet!

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:13.337
Take a break, everyone!

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:38.561
Bohemia crystal.

00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:42.190
Fruit, uh...

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:44.897
exotic fruit.

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:55.979
Chicken.

00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:01.849
A potato.

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:06.320
We're catching on fire here.

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.694
Me too!

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:15.989
Is it good?

00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:21.965
So, maestro,
what's next on the program?

00:27:22.073 --> 00:27:23.301
Ravel's <i>Bolero.</i>

00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:26.377
Ah, Ravel's <i>Bolero.</i>
And who wrote that?

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:27.638
Ravel.

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:30.874
Of course. Ravel's <i>Bolero</i>
was written by Ravel. Who else?

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:33.713
Ravel's <i>Bolero.</i> A great piece!

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.355
Ravel, the great, uh...
French composer.

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:40.522
- French, right?
- Yeah.

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:44.359
At least on his mother's side.
His father was from Umbria.

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:47.129
Born in Gubbio, if I'm not mistaken.

00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:50.232
<i>In the very heart of Umbria.</i>

00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:54.099
<i>"Bolero"is a magical word.</i>

00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:57.470
<i>A fantasy of color and sound.</i>

00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:03.569
<i>There are thousands of ways to describe</i>
<i>this great musical work.</i>

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:46.379
Go over there and grab the chicken.

00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:53.127
Go on!

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:44.012
...in a "bolerian" vein.

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:46.709
Ravel's <i>Bolero.</i>

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.320
We didn't come here
to stuff our faces.

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:09.411
I think this is the end of Part One.

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:14.049
END OF PART ONE

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:18.221
PART TWO

00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:46.343
What's that ape doing here?

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:51.886
There's no ape in the script.

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:53.718
Other animals, yes, but no ape.

00:44:56.393 --> 00:44:58.623
Reminds me of a young man I met

00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:01.630
back in 1912,
before the First World War.

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:04.223
They just don't make men
like that anymore.

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:26.953
Snow in the theater.
A very bad sign.

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.158
Let me go!

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:13.803
This can't be happening!
What is he doing?

00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:19.239
He's getting the women too excited!

00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:22.469
I knew it. When I get nervous,
my eye clamps shut.

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:19.568
The next piece is
Sibelius' <i>Valse Triste.</i>

00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:23.136
And you better get it right,

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.504
or I'll hang you back up
on the wall.

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.643
Remember the wall?

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:12.408
Bravo!

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:18.487
What feeling!

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:21.824
We can't go on like this.

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:25.417
The pieces turn out too sad!
He has no sense of humor!

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:28.463
I'm gonna put him back on the wall!
He'll rot in chains!

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:30.328
Calm down, now!

00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:32.663
Aren't we equally to blame?

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:35.863
An artist needs beauty
in order to express himself best,

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:41.604
and frankly speaking,
those particular girls may not be ideal.

00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:43.474
Nonsense! Art is art!

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.674
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:50.514
What if we were to find him

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.281
a woman?

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.857
A woman he could be with.

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:58.359
Then he'd really start creating.
It'd be perfect!

00:54:58.461 --> 00:55:00.361
I'm going to find one.

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:03.091
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:17.607
Mr. Artist, how's it going?

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:20.114
You look a bit run-down.

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:24.247
I've got some fun for you.

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:26.549
I know a cozy little hideaway.

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:28.681
Come back here.

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:31.825
Get in there.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.696
You know what we want.

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.794
Easy as falling off a log.

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:44.931
You get in the piano,
and nature will do the rest.

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:47.874
Go on, now!

00:55:48.411 --> 00:55:50.538
Hello, everyone!

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:52.638
Our orchestra, such as it is,

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:55.513
the piano, and our artist.

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:58.553
Try to cheer him up.

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:07.227
Want a hand?

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:09.924
The next piece promises to be lively

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:12.092
and full of spice.

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:14.363
A concerto by Vivaldi.

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:17.235
Think we're overdoing it?
Let's get him out.

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.171
Yeah, looks like
they're having too much fun.

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:20.799
That should be enough.

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:23.003
Lift up the lid.

00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:33.982
That's the snag
with these old pianos.

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:37.548
Getting in is a breeze,
but getting out can be a problem.

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:45.062
You better make me laugh now,

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:47.636
or I'll tear you apart piece by piece!

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.814
He looks better already.

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:01.907
He'd better, or I'll see that he does!

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:04.578
He's much more alive.
Look at his eyes!

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.782
I'll tear them out!

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:10.758
You'll see.
The next piece will be fantastic!

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:12.952
Get ready.

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:16.160
Curtain!

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:27.343
Curtain!

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:35.339
I'll show you!

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:38.709
I'll take this pianist
and throw her on your head!

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.716
I'll break every bone in your body!

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:45.413
It's all right!
It's nothing, nothing at all.

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:48.388
Just a little misunderstanding.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.460
Let her go, will you?
A small difference of opinion.

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.028
It's absolutely nothing.

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:56.121
Turn the camera around.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:57.995
It's nothing at all.

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.627
The next number on our program

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:05.969
is the famous <i>Firebird,</i>

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:08.134
by Igor Stravinsky.

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.643
A very famous piece.

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:10.973
Knock it off!

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.674
Turn the camera around.

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:16.946
Igor Stravinsky.

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:20.147
One of the most renowned...

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:26.652
A cascade of notes.

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:29.026
It's music that...

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:36.571
Let me go!
I don't have insurance!

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:38.799
Put me down!

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:48.843
Voilà!

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:51.915
Everything is just fine.

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:56.422
The conductor is taking
just a few moments to himself,

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:59.050
but he'll be back with us very soon.

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:00.719
Okay. Where's the camera?

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.957
Where is the camera?
Ah, there it is.

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:07.066
With that little interruption
behind us,

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:09.399
our performance will now continue

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:13.805
with Dostoyevsky's <i>Firebird.</i>

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.275
As they say in English...

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:24.212
Which in Italian would mean...

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:04.665
A snake!

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:08.943
Stop! Where are you going?

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:10.102
Come back!

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:12.476
It's just a snake!

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:15.675
Stop!
We've got antidote for snake bite!

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:19.811
There's no problem!
We've got tons of antidote!

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:23.184
Damn it, you old hags! Stop!

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:26.159
Do you hear? Stop, I say!

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.175
Traitors!

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:18.677
Leaving me at a time like this.
I even have a cold.

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:21.343
And all because of a little snake.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:24.544
Look! There's nothing left!

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.314
Everything's destroyed!

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:32.554
And here we are once again!

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:35.053
Now for a finale of a different sort,

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:37.597
one we had planned and prepared.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:41.226
One that needs neither orchestra
nor conductor nor music.

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:45.204
I'm happy to say
our artist is still here with us.

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:48.674
Our artist who...

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:52.503
What are you doing?

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:56.277
What the devil are you doing?

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.080
Drawing her?

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:10.060
What do you think you're doing?

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.100
You can't leave me here like this!

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:17.736
Hey, wait a second!
Wait for me!

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:21.037
I'm going with you!
I want to go too!

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.440
Wait!

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:25.035
Don't go!
How will we finish the film?

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.444
We haven't done a finale!

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:28.812
Wait for me!

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:30.942
We have to do a finale!

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:37.251
I have to find
a good idea for a finale.

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:39.058
The telephone!

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:41.595
That's it! I'll call the archives.

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:47.162
Hello, Franceschini?

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:51.471
You have to help me find a finale!

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:54.235
Any finale at all.

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:57.779
The files are full of'em!
Bring me one right away!

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:05.247
A finale.

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:46.969
It's all over.

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:53.881
Ready, girls?

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:57.879
We've got to do Stravinsky's <i>Firebird.</i>

01:20:57.986 --> 01:21:00.011
It's over with.

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:03.417
The finale, then.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:06.252
That's all over with too.

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:09.454
You might as well
go back down there.

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:13.694
We're unemployed, then.

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:17.169
Unemployed... until the next movie.

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:19.934
I've already got an idea.

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:21.938
A brand-new idea.

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:27.208
We could do a love story.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:29.009
A love story?

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:32.883
But not the usual kind
about men and women.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:37.551
Lots of men with lots of women.

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:39.024
Wife-swapping?

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:41.561
No, not that same old stuff.
Something different.

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:45.497
I like asymmetry.
Seven men and one woman.

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:47.301
That'll cost a lot.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:49.199
No, not at all.

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:52.068
We'll get little tiny men...

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:54.733
and we'll make
the woman real tall.

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:56.572
It'll be fantastic!

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:57.906
Sounds scary.

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:59.605
Careful.

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:01.045
What do you mean, scary?

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:05.848
Seven little workers,
so you get the social context, too.

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:07.979
A mine! They'll work in a mine!

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:11.855
I can see them now, singing happily.

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:15.288
Have you thought of a title?

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:17.627
That'll be easy. Let's see.

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:19.322
"Sleeping Beauty."

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:22.666
Now, keep it under your hat

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:27.105
or some screenwriter hack
might steal the idea.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.835
You can't trust anyone these days.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:31.003
He'll change the title,
play up the sex,

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:33.774
and give it some crazy name like

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.509
<i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.</i>

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.551
And then we'll be screwed!
