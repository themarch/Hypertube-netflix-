00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.171
What I love about Nicole.

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:28.456
She makes people feel comfortable
about even embarrassing things.

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:31.746
- You look like you care about animals.
- Yes, I do.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.713
She really listens
when someone is talking.

00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:35.331
Do you wanna sign up here?

00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:36.576
You know what?

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.666
It's funny, I actually signed up for this
but I never heard from you guys.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.130
Sometimes she listens too much
for too long.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.668
Okay, if you email me here...

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.130
- Thank you so much. Have a good day.
- Good luck.

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:47.288
She's a good citizen.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.166
- Just call him.
- I'm not calling.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.000
She always knows the right thing to do
when it comes to difficult family shit.

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:54.963
Call him.

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:02.076
I get stuck in my ways
and she knows when to push me

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.326
and when to leave me alone.

00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:08.751
She cuts all our hair.

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:20.245
Yeah!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.670
She's always inexplicably
brewing a cup of tea

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.880
that she doesn't drink.

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:32.498
And it's not easy for her
to put away a sock or close a cabinet

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:34.883
or do a dish, but she tries for me.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.460
Nicole grew up in LA around actors

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:40.831
and directors and movies and TV,

00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:43.416
and is very close to her mother, Sandra,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.920
and Cassie, her sister.

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:47.705
Note the wrapping.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.500
Nicole gives great presents.

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:09.918
She is a mother who plays, really plays.

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.788
She never steps off playing

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:15.035
or says it's too much.

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:15.996
Mom.

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:18.503
And it must be too much some of the time.

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.126
"Chopped down a Christmas tree..."

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:23.538
All right.

00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:25.213
Nice. Two, three, four.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.131
What?

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:29.248
Are you kidding me? I was just in jail!

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:30.753
Goddamn it!

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:32.293
Do not laugh at me. Stop it.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:33.575
She's competitive.

00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:38.171
She's amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.880
which I've always found very sexy.

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:42.503
She keeps the fridge over-full.

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:44.383
No one is ever hungry in our house.

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:46.785
She can drive a stick.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.170
How could you?

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.250
After that movie, All Over the Girl,

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:55.883
she could have stayed in LA
and been a movie star,

00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.828
but she gave that up to do theater
with me in New York.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.420
You might as well get what you paid for.

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:03.041
She's brave.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:07.668
She's a great dancer.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.880
Infectious.

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.248
She makes me wish I could dance.

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.921
She always says
when she doesn't know something

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.960
or hasn't read a book
or seen a film or a play,

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:19.251
whereas I fake it or say something
like, "I haven't seen that in awhile."

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:26.075
My crazy ideas are her favorite things
to figure out how to execute.

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:32.915
Let's try it...

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.075
crawling...

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:40.245
but also standing.

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:42.708
She's my favorite actress.

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.575
What I love about Charlie.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.080
Charlie is undaunted.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.915
He never lets other people's opinions
or any setbacks

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.460
keep him from what he wants to do.

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.416
Charlie eats like he's trying
to get it over with

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.000
and like there won't be enough food
for everyone.

00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:07.833
A sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.630
Is your shirt on backwards?

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.630
But he's incredibly neat,

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:14.038
and I rely on him
to keep things in order.

00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:17.171
So...

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.881
He's energy-conscious.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:22.173
Hey.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:25.173
Sorry.

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:27.826
He doesn't look in the mirror too often.

00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:29.576
I cried four times.

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:30.496
Me too.

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.003
He cries easily in movies.

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:33.883
I wonder if it was the same four.

00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:35.626
He's very self-sufficient.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:39.328
He can darn a sock
and cook himself dinner and iron a shirt.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:42.625
How are we doing over here?

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.326
The peppers are cut.

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:46.416
He rarely gets defeated, which...

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:48.376
I feel like I always do.

00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:49.748
Cut some carrots.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.746
Charlie takes all of my moods steadily.

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:56.503
He doesn't give in to them
or make me feel bad about them.

00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:58.538
He's a great dresser.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.040
He never looks embarrassing,
which is hard for a man.

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:04.668
Goddamn it, Charlie, get it together!

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.210
He's very competitive.

00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:07.381
Oh, come on!

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:10.543
- What's this? Who owns Baltic Avenue?
- Me.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.205
How much is it? I don't have enough.

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:13.631
Four hundred and fifty dollars.

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.328
Okay, so I'm done?
I'm done, right? That's it?

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.793
This is so frustrating!

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:22.455
This is so frustrating.
I always lose at this game.

00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:24.535
- Dad?
- He loves being a dad.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.785
He loves all the things you're supposed
to hate, like the tantrums,

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:29.165
the waking up at night.

00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:32.291
I had a bad dream.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.210
It's okay.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.170
It's almost annoying how much he likes it,

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.170
but then it's mostly nice.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.960
Dad, stay.

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:16.036
He disappears into his own world.

00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:18.671
Shit.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.040
- What's shit?
- This is our stop.

00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:22.916
He and Henry are alike in that way.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.080
He can tell people
when they have food in their teeth

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:29.916
or on their face in a way
that doesn't make them feel bad.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Did you get it? Perfect.

00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:34.168
Charlie is self-made.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.710
His parents...

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:37.915
I only met them once, but...

00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:42.418
he told me there was a lot of alcohol
and some violence in his childhood.

00:06:43.583 --> 00:06:46.293
As soon as she comes with a lookout,
they come in on the camcorder.

00:06:46.375 --> 00:06:47.915
- Camcorder.
- Is that what they're called now?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.920
He moved to New York from Indiana
with no safety net.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.630
And now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:55.208
Made sure they used the right almond milk.

00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:56.131
Genius.

00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:59.248
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:05.415
With the theater company, he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included.

00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.331
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant.

00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:10.746
He could remember all the inside jokes.

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:13.173
Where do you go when it's windy?

00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:15.631
Oh, yeah, that... that was funny.

00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:22.575
He's extremely organized and thorough.

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:25.626
He's very clear about what he wants,

00:07:25.708 --> 00:07:27.958
unlike me, who can't always tell.

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:29.745
Let's stop right there.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.500
Who wants to start?

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:00.791
I'm not gonna read this out loud.

00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:04.328
Why is that?

00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.538
Because I don't like what I wrote.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.290
As we mediate your separation

00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:13.788
and eventual divorce...

00:08:14.666 --> 00:08:17.456
things can get quite contentious.

00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:20.791
So I like to begin
with a note of positivity

00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:23.208
for the people I work with to remember

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:25.418
why they got married in the first place.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.460
And so that, as you come apart,

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.251
you're reminded that...

00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:33.955
this is a person
you had great feeling for,

00:08:34.708 --> 00:08:37.128
and maybe still do in many ways.

00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:42.671
I'll read mine. I like what I wrote.

00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:45.456
For it to really work,

00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:47.286
you both have to read.

00:08:47.375 --> 00:08:48.575
I'm not going to.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.630
Okay, um...

00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:55.038
I just think it's a shame
that you guys aren't gonna get to hear

00:08:55.625 --> 00:08:57.575
the wonderful things
you wrote about each other.

00:08:58.166 --> 00:09:00.246
She always says I can't write,
but I think mine's pretty good.

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:03.293
Nicole, maybe you'd change your mind
once you heard Charlie's.

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:04.785
I don't wanna hear Charlie's.

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:06.125
We promised to listen.

00:09:06.208 --> 00:09:07.038
That's right.

00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:10.581
That's the very first step
in this process.

00:09:12.083 --> 00:09:15.423
Well, I think I'm gonna go
if you two are gonna just sit around

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.540
and suck each other's dicks.

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:26.288
How can this evil allow moderation?

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:28.535
How can this evil allow moderation?

00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:31.293
How can it be right
to betray the departed?

00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:34.751
How is it human to be so...

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:36.666
faithless?

00:09:38.416 --> 00:09:40.916
I want no praise from impious men.

00:09:41.708 --> 00:09:43.878
No home with them of quiet ease.

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.038
Noble blood still runs in my veins.

00:09:48.458 --> 00:09:49.918
Shall I fail my father...

00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:52.206
stifling my cries,

00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:54.416
clipping the wings of grief?

00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:57.786
Must his corpse in the ground

00:09:57.875 --> 00:10:00.375
wretchedly waste away,
feebly count for nothing?

00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:02.288
Must his killers gloat,

00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:05.251
- never to pay with blood for blood?
- Must his killers gloat,

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.383
never to pay with blood for blood?

00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:10.248
Charlie gave me the note,
but it's really for you.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.960
- He told me to pick up my cues.
- How is that for me?

00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:14.751
Acting is reacting.

00:10:14.833 --> 00:10:16.383
- I'm responding to you.
- I got intimate.

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:19.168
- And you're slowing me down.
- Frank, it's closing night, you know.

00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:22.878
You don't think Charlie and Nicole
will ever get back together?

00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.538
No, I think this time it's really over.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.245
It still feels weird.

00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:29.633
I feel like my parents are splitting up.

00:10:29.916 --> 00:10:31.496
It's always been Charlie and Nicole.

00:10:31.583 --> 00:10:33.043
- Is Charlie still giving notes?
- Yep.

00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:34.665
You're lucky. I wish I was going to LA.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.040
You can actually have space in LA.
There's no space here.

00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:38.455
But there's no winter.

00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:40.583
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.500
I wanna make a toast

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.128
to Charlie

00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:47.575
and to our beloved Nicole,

00:10:47.666 --> 00:10:51.826
who is going to be going out
on a new adventure

00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:54.876
all the way to sunny California.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.790
And we are also going to try
something new.

00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:01.915
We are going to take our play
to Broadway.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.920
Yeah!

00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:07.631
It reminds me of when I was a young person

00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:09.998
and went to Broadway for the first time.

00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:11.083
And I'm telling you,

00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:14.921
winning your first Tony at 27,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.130
it can mess with your head.

00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:19.918
I mean, I was just a baby.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.460
- Elia Kazan was backstage...
- I'm gonna go over there now.

00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:24.881
- Don't do it. Mary Ann?
- elbowing Mike Nichols.

00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.828
And Mike was jabbing with Dietrich,

00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:29.326
and Marlene, you know,

00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:31.916
she usually was a barrel of monkeys,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.580
but tonight she was very,
very serious. And of course...

00:11:36.666 --> 00:11:39.416
- Could you give me a second?
- later I realized, "My, but that..."

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:01.245
Well, I'd have to study it,
but I'd say you got...

00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:02.963
- Hi.
- Oh.

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:05.665
Hey, I didn't expect you guys home
until late.

00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:08.381
- How's he doing?
- Good. He went to bed on time.

00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:11.208
No fuss. Read him some
of Cricket in Time Square.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.420
God, you guys are so attractive.

00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:18.706
Shit. Sorry, I didn't stop that
from being said.

00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:20.745
No, it's okay.

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:23.581
I'll pay for the whole time.
We decided to come home early.

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:25.456
Hey, thanks. And also...

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:43.245
conversation as well as anybody,
but I've gotta run.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.040
Hasta pronto, if you know what I mean.

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:47.825
- You're leaving?
- Well, I ain't movin' in.

00:12:49.916 --> 00:12:51.456
Oh, we'll be back when you get your...

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.630
If you don't like that mediator,
we'll find another one.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.880
- Yeah.
- We might not need a mediator.

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.748
We'll split everything anyway,
I don't care.

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:06.753
- Me neither.
- You can have most of it.

00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:10.001
We'll get apartments near each other,
make it easier for Henry.

00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:11.463
We'll figure it out.
We want the same things.

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:15.126
- Right.
- Meantime, the pilot will be fun for you.

00:13:17.916 --> 00:13:19.876
You don't think it's bad, do you?

00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.128
I don't ever watch TV,

00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:23.248
so, you know, I can't tell.

00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:34.793
I told Henry I'd come out to LA
in two weeks to see him.

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:39.288
Yes?

00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:41.286
Nothing.

00:13:43.458 --> 00:13:45.328
I can tell you wanna give me a note.

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:46.286
No, I don't.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.290
Yeah, I mean... yes, I do, but I guess...

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:55.293
I guess it doesn't matter now.

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:57.955
You won't be with the show anymore.
It's stupid.

00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:01.381
You're not gonna be able to sleep
until you tell me.

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:03.748
Maybe not.

00:14:04.916 --> 00:14:05.916
Okay, then.

00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:07.876
So there are two things.

00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:12.246
I thought your posture at the top
of scene seven is still too dignified.

00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:14.423
Okay.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.500
And then...

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.630
at the end, I could tell
you were pushing for the emotion.

00:14:20.083 --> 00:14:21.793
Well, you know I can't cry on stage

00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:24.165
and I know you don't like it
when I fake it, but...

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.710
I thought maybe tonight
it would come, but...

00:14:28.916 --> 00:14:29.876
it didn't.

00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:32.125
That's all I had.

00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:35.708
Thanks for indulging me.

00:14:40.916 --> 00:14:41.876
Good night, Charlie.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:21.325
This is the day, this is the day
That the Lord has made

00:15:21.416 --> 00:15:23.496
That the Lord has made

00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:25.463
Let us rejoice

00:15:26.083 --> 00:15:28.173
Let us rejoice and be glad in it

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.750
And be glad in it

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:31.785
Mom.

00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:34.495
G-ma, summer is for relaxing.

00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:35.753
This is the day...

00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.043
What do you wanna do today?

00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.708
Hang out and relax with you.

00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:41.881
- Me too.
- No relaxing.

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:44.665
Nicole has a hair and makeup test today,

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.000
and Henry, we got you into Fairy Camp
with the cousins.

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:50.043
I hate Fairy Camp.

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:52.375
Cassie says everyone likes Fairy Camp,

00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:55.168
and I think this is true.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.245
Henry, go make your mom some coffee
like I taught you.

00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:03.881
Mom, wait till you taste my coffee.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.380
Oop-a-doodle.

00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:14.793
Do you always sleep together?

00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:16.075
Even in New York?

00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:19.206
No, it's just for right now
while we go through this transition.

00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:20.961
Oh, shit.

00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:24.001
Don't tell Charlie when he gets here.
He hates co-sleeping.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:26.673
Well, I have to say, I agree with Charlie.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.670
Oh, surprise surprise.

00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:32.168
- It's as if you have exploded...
- Jesus, it's early.

00:16:32.708 --> 00:16:34.038
Into this room.

00:16:34.916 --> 00:16:36.456
I can do this part alone.

00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:38.001
Fine. I won't look.

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:43.748
As long as you're in my house,
wake up is at 6:30 a.m.,

00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:45.633
and until you know what you wanna do,

00:16:45.708 --> 00:16:47.498
we're gonna do what I like to do.

00:16:47.583 --> 00:16:51.463
I can't just go from what Charlie
wanted to do to what you want to do.

00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.168
Even though I am 64

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.000
and have a dead gay husband,

00:16:56.083 --> 00:16:58.883
I manage to get up every day,

00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.578
live my life, and feel pretty good
about myself.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.790
So maybe your mom knows a thing or two.

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:05.633
You know what I would do?

00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:07.208
About what?

00:17:07.291 --> 00:17:08.541
When Charlie gets here,

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.745
I'd whisk him off to Palm Springs.

00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:13.833
That's what your father and I did
whenever we hit a speed bump.

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:17.383
Didn't you walk in on Dad
blowing the porter in Palm Springs?

00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:21.248
And I always regretted
getting so upset about it.

00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:25.213
Charlie and I are getting a divorce, Mom.
There's nothing for us in Palm Springs.

00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:27.791
You need to wash your face
before you go to sleep.

00:17:28.166 --> 00:17:31.206
When Daddy gets here,
maybe we could all go on the Jaws ride.

00:17:31.291 --> 00:17:32.131
Yeah.

00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:34.328
Or I could go once with Daddy
and once with you

00:17:34.416 --> 00:17:36.246
because I wouldn't mind
going twice anyway.

00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:37.583
We'll all go together, sweetheart.

00:17:37.666 --> 00:17:39.496
Did you know that Universal Studios

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:41.543
is where I did my first screen test?

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:44.625
On the plane, I re-read the pilot
as if I were Charlie reading it

00:17:44.708 --> 00:17:46.458
and I started to think it was just bad.

00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.168
My agent says it's one to watch.

00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:52.333
This coffee is good. Thank you.

00:17:52.416 --> 00:17:53.286
You're welcome.

00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:55.665
What if Charlie is on Broadway

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.880
with a play I brought him,
which I originated,

00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.418
and I'm just doing bad TV?

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.540
Everyone is only impressed
when they see someone on TV.

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.325
She's beautiful.

00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:07.786
- Her wig looks great.
- Where's she been for the past ten years?

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:10.625
Doing weird theater in New York,
downtown shit.

00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:12.828
- I saw one. It rained onstage.
- Can I say something?

00:18:12.916 --> 00:18:14.376
It was good. It was edgy.

00:18:14.458 --> 00:18:17.328
Directed by her husband.
Supposedly very controlling.

00:18:17.416 --> 00:18:19.786
- We're lucky to have her.
- I'm surprised she said yes.

00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:21.125
We can thank her divorce.

00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:22.418
Can she move her hand?

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.250
It'll be hard to roto in the hair
on the baby around her fingers.

00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:28.043
Can you move your hand
further down the baby?

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.080
Where? Like here?

00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:34.286
Off the head entirely.

00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.538
I have to support his head.

00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:39.625
No, support the head, of course.
Just try and do it from the shoulders.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.830
- It's perfect.
- Yes, good.

00:18:42.916 --> 00:18:45.286
- I can't hold a baby like this.
- She's right, that's gonna look weird.

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.375
We can totally do it.
It'll just take time and money.

00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:50.288
It's very important
to have this show based on hard science.

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:52.375
So we can see your pretty face
and not ours.

00:18:53.458 --> 00:18:55.628
You should've seen me
before the plants invaded.

00:18:55.708 --> 00:18:56.958
I say that with respect.

00:18:57.041 --> 00:18:58.421
I was raised by two mothers.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.880
Can you lower the board please, Pablo?

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:05.166
Here? How about here?

00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:08.463
- How about now?
- Why is there always a flirty grip?

00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:10.751
I can do anything you want.
I need her here two hours before...

00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:11.713
Can I say something?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.670
Hold on. What, honey?

00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:15.956
She has to know how to hold a baby.

00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:17.711
Later on, after she kills Donny...

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:19.131
- She kills Donny?
- That's a secret.

00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:21.168
She becomes a sort of a Earth mother...

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.420
to the plant community.

00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:26.543
That's not gonna make any sense if we feel
like she's a bad mother to her own kid.

00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:28.205
- She's right.
- Does Donny know?

00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:30.791
- Must be nice to get out of New York.
- Well, I'm from out here.

00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:33.375
Our daughter, Mia, is at NYU,
living in a shoebox.

00:19:33.458 --> 00:19:35.418
She says it went up to 104 the other day.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.830
- We are just so excited to have you.
- I'm excited to be here.

00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:42.536
We're going for an early aughts aesthetic,
so having your presence just nails that.

00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:43.825
What signifies early aughts?

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:46.286
- Into the Girl was on TV...
- All Over the Girl.

00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:47.575
Or streaming or something.

00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:49.536
You are fucking hot in that movie.

00:19:49.625 --> 00:19:51.285
- Carol.
- Fuck it, I speak my mind.

00:19:51.375 --> 00:19:53.915
- We're not allowing our son to see it.
- Because you show your tits.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.380
- Carol!
- Dennis.

00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:59.168
This is Carter Mitchum.
He's a futurist at UCLA.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.710
He's consulting on all the environmental
stuff for the show so it's accurate.

00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:04.331
- Nice to meet you.
- Is it?

00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:05.376
- What?
- Accurate?

00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:06.418
So far, none of it.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.420
This pilot will go.
So just get ready to move back to LA.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.500
Everything you were saying back there
was absolutely right.

00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:15.633
- If she's a bad mom, we lose the audience.
- Nobody knows we're killing Donny,

00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:16.708
including Donny.

00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:17.631
I thought...

00:20:17.708 --> 00:20:20.288
Let us know if you'd like to be part
of our writer's room.

00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:22.495
I bet you'd be really helpful, actually.

00:20:22.583 --> 00:20:24.043
Or I could direct.

00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:26.455
- No, yeah.
- Sorry, what? Maybe that sounds crazy.

00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:27.711
No, do you have a reel?

00:20:28.333 --> 00:20:32.133
No, because I've never done it.
I watched my husband do it for years.

00:20:32.708 --> 00:20:34.168
Almost ex-husband.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.290
Oh, what's the opposite of fiancé?

00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:39.126
Dennis and I'll talk
to your agent about it.

00:20:39.208 --> 00:20:41.998
At our theater I always wanted to direct,
and then Charlie would say something

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:44.423
like, "The next one,"
but he was always the director,

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.960
so there never was a next one.

00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:49.825
I don't know. Maybe if we'd stayed married
there would've been.

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:52.326
We're gonna kill him off.
It seems unlikely...

00:20:55.416 --> 00:20:56.916
I'm gonna give you a number.

00:20:57.291 --> 00:21:00.041
Okay, is it a therapist?
'Cause I have a therapist.

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:02.705
Well, it's my mom's therapist.
We share her.

00:21:02.791 --> 00:21:05.541
She's a lawyer. She represented me
when I left Dennis.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.670
Oh. You and Dennis are divorced?

00:21:08.791 --> 00:21:09.791
Since 2013.

00:21:09.875 --> 00:21:11.075
You still work together.

00:21:11.708 --> 00:21:12.578
That's nice.

00:21:12.666 --> 00:21:14.036
Oh, no, he's a fucking cocksucker.

00:21:14.125 --> 00:21:16.205
Nora got me half of this project
in the settlement.

00:21:16.791 --> 00:21:17.671
Oh.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.920
Well, we talked about doing it
without lawyers.

00:21:20.583 --> 00:21:22.383
My sister had me meet
a bunch of them already

00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:24.958
and I just hated them.

00:21:25.625 --> 00:21:26.455
Call Nora.

00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:28.581
She saved my life.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.330
Sorry, I...

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:32.786
look so schleppy.

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.325
I had an event at my kid's school.

00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:36.831
Let me get this out of the way.

00:21:36.916 --> 00:21:39.206
I think you're a wonderful actress.

00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:40.788
Thank you.

00:21:40.875 --> 00:21:42.705
I loved All Over the Girl,

00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:45.131
but the theater stuff too...

00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:46.418
You saw the theater stuff?

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.000
I was in New York last year for my book,

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:50.713
which, remind me to give you a copy,

00:21:50.791 --> 00:21:52.711
and my publisher took me.

00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:53.631
Great.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.040
- Thank you.
- You're awesome.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.710
- Well, Charlie directed it.
- I know.

00:22:01.291 --> 00:22:02.501
He's very talented.

00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:03.673
He is.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.210
They're moving it to Broadway.

00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:08.333
Well, without me, of course.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.170
He was lucky to have you.

00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:13.923
How are you doing?

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:23.628
- Oh.
- Sorry.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.080
Honey...

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:36.875
You take some breaths.

00:22:38.083 --> 00:22:41.133
And while you do,
I'm gonna tell you about myself.

00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:44.211
If you should choose to hire me,

00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:46.331
I will work tirelessly for you,

00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:48.956
and I'm always available by phone or text,

00:22:49.083 --> 00:22:50.713
except when I'm with my kids.

00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:53.631
I insist on doing drop off and pick up
every day at school.

00:22:53.708 --> 00:22:55.708
- I understand.
- I've been through this myself.

00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:58.576
Thank you, Annie. So...

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.920
I know how it feels.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.830
- You do?
- Yes.

00:23:02.916 --> 00:23:06.576
I have a kid from my ex,
and he's a narcissistic artist...

00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:08.921
and verbally abusive.

00:23:09.416 --> 00:23:11.916
I'm now with a great boyfriend
who lives in Malibu.

00:23:12.666 --> 00:23:13.496
Good.

00:23:14.833 --> 00:23:16.253
Well, Charlie's not terrible.

00:23:16.333 --> 00:23:17.673
No, of course not.

00:23:18.166 --> 00:23:20.786
But they ravish you with attention
in the beginning,

00:23:21.416 --> 00:23:24.166
and then once we have babies,
we become the mom

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.210
and they get sick of us.

00:23:29.583 --> 00:23:31.043
Where do you wanna live now, doll?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.830
Well...

00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:36.415
I'm here now, obviously.

00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:39.501
I don't know
if the show'll get picked up, but...

00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:42.041
feels like home.

00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:44.375
It is home.

00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:47.375
It's the only home I've ever known
without Charlie.

00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:49.326
You wanna stay here?

00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:51.956
Charlie's not gonna want that. He...

00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:54.288
He hates LA.

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:56.495
We're interested in what you wanna do.

00:23:57.583 --> 00:24:00.333
Sounds to me
like you did your time in New York.

00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:03.458
He can do some time here, no?

00:24:03.541 --> 00:24:05.251
He always said we would, but he never...

00:24:06.458 --> 00:24:07.288
did.

00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:09.043
How old is your son?

00:24:09.625 --> 00:24:10.575
Henry's eight.

00:24:12.125 --> 00:24:13.125
He likes LA.

00:24:15.916 --> 00:24:17.666
I don't know if it's fair to him.

00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:20.793
I want you to listen to me.

00:24:22.916 --> 00:24:25.286
What you're doing is an act of hope.

00:24:26.375 --> 00:24:27.495
Do you understand that?

00:24:29.041 --> 00:24:29.881
Yeah.

00:24:30.583 --> 00:24:34.133
You're saying,
"I want something better for myself."

00:24:34.916 --> 00:24:35.916
I do.

00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:39.205
And this, right now, is the worst time.

00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:41.666
It will only get better.

00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:47.078
Wasn't it Tom Petty who said
"The waiting is the hardest part"?

00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:48.036
Oh.

00:24:48.458 --> 00:24:49.328
I don't know.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.250
I represented his wife
in their divorce.

00:24:52.916 --> 00:24:54.286
I got her half of that song.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.080
Oh, I don't want any money or anything.

00:24:58.166 --> 00:25:00.786
I just worried 'cause we weren't
gonna use lawyers, so...

00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:03.628
I don't wanna be too aggressive.

00:25:05.041 --> 00:25:06.631
I wanna stay friends.

00:25:08.333 --> 00:25:10.383
We'll do it as gently as possible.

00:25:11.666 --> 00:25:12.496
Now...

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.080
can you tell me a little more
about what's going on?

00:25:18.833 --> 00:25:22.463
Because part of what we're gonna
do together is tell your story.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.580
It's difficult to articulate.

00:25:26.666 --> 00:25:27.706
It's...

00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:30.171
not as simple
as not being in love anymore.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.830
I understand.

00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:36.003
Why don't you start at the beginning?
Wherever that is for you.

00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:39.498
Well...

00:25:40.833 --> 00:25:42.633
I was engaged to Ben

00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:44.498
and living in LA, you know?

00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:49.328
And I felt like yes, I wanted
to make movies and marry Ben.

00:25:49.833 --> 00:25:52.423
Oh, Jesus,
I was only 19 or 20 at the time.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.210
I never felt older in my whole life.

00:25:54.666 --> 00:25:56.916
Anyway, if I was honest with myself,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.170
it was like a small part of me
felt dead...

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.080
or dead-ish.

00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:02.381
You know, you tell yourself,

00:26:02.458 --> 00:26:04.328
"No one's perfect,
no relationship's perfect."

00:26:06.833 --> 00:26:08.963
Oh, this tea is delicious.

00:26:09.041 --> 00:26:10.831
Isn't it? It's the Manuka honey.

00:26:12.166 --> 00:26:14.876
Anyway, you were asking about Charlie.

00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:16.666
So, um...

00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:19.126
So, yes. So I was...

00:26:19.625 --> 00:26:22.325
happy with Ben and aware of the deadness,

00:26:22.416 --> 00:26:23.996
and I went to New York

00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:27.075
to meet with this director
for this space movie.

00:26:27.458 --> 00:26:29.458
But one where they take space seriously,

00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:32.131
like sex trafficking in space.

00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:33.633
You know, it was political.

00:26:33.791 --> 00:26:36.331
Or at least they wanted us
to think it was. Anyway.

00:26:36.458 --> 00:26:37.418
It just...

00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:41.131
it was really fulfilling the same need
that certain fucked up porn does.

00:26:42.041 --> 00:26:43.081
But anyway, so...

00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:44.875
while I was there...

00:26:45.791 --> 00:26:46.921
the producer...

00:26:47.416 --> 00:26:48.876
invited me to see a play.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.580
It took place in someone's apartment
with all the lights on.

00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:56.131
It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

00:26:56.208 --> 00:26:58.168
This strange...

00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:01.421
surreal, dystopian story,

00:27:01.666 --> 00:27:03.326
and it was so well-acted.

00:27:03.416 --> 00:27:07.376
And one of the actors
was this big shaggy bear

00:27:07.458 --> 00:27:10.248
who played all his lines
looking directly at me,

00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:13.633
which I knew couldn't be the case,
but it felt like it.

00:27:14.083 --> 00:27:16.173
And then later,
of course, I learned that it was.

00:27:19.416 --> 00:27:22.166
- These cookies are really great too.
- I'll send you home with some.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.500
Afterwards, I was introduced to the cast,

00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:28.133
and the bear turned out
to also be the director.

00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:30.455
He talked to me and...

00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:34.248
I talked back.

00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:38.711
The dead part wasn't dead,
it was just in a coma.

00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:40.288
And...

00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:43.325
it was better than the sex, the talking.

00:27:43.833 --> 00:27:44.753
Although the...

00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:47.293
the sex was also like the talking.

00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:49.745
You know, everything's like everything
in a relationship.

00:27:49.833 --> 00:27:50.793
Don't you find that?

00:27:51.708 --> 00:27:52.538
And...

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.290
So we spent...

00:27:55.458 --> 00:27:57.578
the whole night
and the next day together and...

00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:00.628
I just never left.

00:28:01.125 --> 00:28:04.825
Yes, to be honest, all the problems
were there in the beginning too.

00:28:05.291 --> 00:28:08.711
But I just went along with him
and his life because it felt so damn good

00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:10.081
to feel myself alive.

00:28:11.708 --> 00:28:14.828
In the beginning,
I was the actress, the star and...

00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:18.825
that felt like something, you know,
people came to see me at first, but...

00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:22.333
the farther away I got from that and...

00:28:23.125 --> 00:28:26.245
the more acclaim the theater company got,
and I had less and less weight.

00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:27.633
I just became...

00:28:28.458 --> 00:28:29.288
"Who?

00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:32.165
Well, you know, the actress
that was in that thing that time."

00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:33.875
And he was the draw.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.130
And that...

00:28:37.458 --> 00:28:38.878
would've been fine, but...

00:28:40.666 --> 00:28:41.876
I got smaller.

00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:49.955
I realized I...

00:28:51.583 --> 00:28:55.133
I didn't ever come alive for myself.
I was just feeding his aliveness.

00:28:56.291 --> 00:28:57.131
And...

00:28:58.583 --> 00:28:59.673
you know...

00:28:59.875 --> 00:29:01.995
he was so smart and creative, it...

00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:03.665
it was fine.

00:29:04.416 --> 00:29:07.666
You know, I would tell him things
at home in private

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.830
and they would work their way into public
conversation into his work, and...

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.460
for a while, that felt like enough,
I mean, I was just so...

00:29:15.041 --> 00:29:17.921
so flattered that someone like him

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.670
would find an idea I had worth trying

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.210
or a comment I made worth repeating and...

00:29:23.708 --> 00:29:24.918
and then I got pregnant.

00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:28.998
And I thought that having a baby
could be ours, could really be ours,

00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:30.543
but also really mine.

00:29:30.958 --> 00:29:33.668
And, you know, he was so excited.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.460
So it was nice.

00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:37.133
For a while.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.130
I mean, kids, they...

00:29:39.833 --> 00:29:41.673
they belong to themselves, it's like...

00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:44.381
the instant
they leave your body, it's just...

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:47.626
the process of them going away...

00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:50.378
And I didn't belong to myself.

00:29:50.583 --> 00:29:54.003
And it was small stuff,
stupid stuff, and big stuff.

00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:56.213
All the furniture in our house,

00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:57.671
that was his taste.

00:29:57.791 --> 00:29:59.831
I didn't even know
what my taste was anymore

00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:02.166
because I'd never been asked to use it.

00:30:02.541 --> 00:30:05.421
I didn't even pick our apartment.
I just moved into his.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.920
And I made noises
about wanting to move back to LA,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.750
but they came to nothing.

00:30:09.833 --> 00:30:12.333
And we'd come here on holidays
because he liked my family.

00:30:12.416 --> 00:30:15.076
But if I suggested
we do a year or something,

00:30:15.875 --> 00:30:17.035
he'd just put me off.

00:30:17.416 --> 00:30:18.576
It would be...

00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:22.246
strange if he turned to me and said,

00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:24.581
"And what do you wanna do today?"

00:30:25.625 --> 00:30:29.205
You know, I just watched that documentary
on George Harrison,

00:30:29.416 --> 00:30:30.786
and I thought, "Own it."

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.130
Just own it.
Be like George Harrison's wife.

00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:36.291
"Being a wife and a mother, that's enough."

00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:39.881
Yeah, then I realized I couldn't
remember her name, so...

00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:43.206
This pilot came along.

00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:47.211
It shot in LA and it paid so much,

00:30:47.583 --> 00:30:50.583
and it was like there was
this little lifeline thrown to me.

00:30:50.875 --> 00:30:53.785
Here's this bit of earth
that's yours, and...

00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:58.003
I was embarrassed about it
in front of him, but it was also like...

00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:01.286
yeah, this is who I am

00:31:01.708 --> 00:31:03.078
and this is what I'm worth.

00:31:03.166 --> 00:31:04.746
And maybe it's stupid,

00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:06.213
but at least it's mine.

00:31:07.291 --> 00:31:11.291
And if he had just taken me
into a big hug and said,

00:31:11.666 --> 00:31:14.076
"Baby, I'm so excited for your adventure.

00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:16.786
Of course I want you to have
a piece of earth that's yours,"

00:31:17.583 --> 00:31:18.463
then...

00:31:18.708 --> 00:31:20.628
well, then,
we might not be getting divorced.

00:31:21.125 --> 00:31:21.955
But...

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
he made fun of it and...

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.710
was jealous like he is, and...

00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:30.746
then he realized about the money.

00:31:31.375 --> 00:31:34.285
And he told me I could funnel it
back into the theater company.

00:31:35.916 --> 00:31:38.166
And that's when I realized...

00:31:39.291 --> 00:31:40.131
he...

00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:42.825
truly didn't see me.

00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:46.668
He didn't see me as something
separate from himself.

00:31:47.833 --> 00:31:50.003
And I asked him to say my phone number.

00:31:51.333 --> 00:31:52.293
He didn't know it.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.040
So I left.

00:32:00.458 --> 00:32:03.578
Also, I think he slept
with the stage manager, Mary Ann.

00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:07.041
That fucking asshole.

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:09.825
Seventy-five... just 70,

00:32:09.916 --> 00:32:11.036
those two zeroes,

00:32:11.125 --> 00:32:13.785
- seventy-five point zero zero...
- "If railroad is unowned..."

00:32:13.875 --> 00:32:16.075
- that's zero cents.
- "...you may buy it from the bank."

00:32:16.166 --> 00:32:18.956
"Advance to Illios...

00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:21.171
- Illinois.
- "...Illinois Avenue."

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.670
"Advance," what does that mean?

00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:25.921
It means you've gotta go
to Illinois Avenue.

00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:28.211
So where is Illinois Avenue?

00:32:28.291 --> 00:32:29.421
That one.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.920
So, Cassie, when Charlie gets here,
you're gonna hand him the envelope.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.670
Why do I have to do it?

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.000
Because Nicole is very good

00:32:37.083 --> 00:32:39.333
at getting people to do things for her.

00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:41.746
- That's not what this is.
- I wiped her butt till she was nine.

00:32:41.833 --> 00:32:43.793
- She's very seductive that way.
- No.

00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:46.665
Mom, legally,
I can't be the one who serves him.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.960
But still, what I'm saying is true.

00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:51.961
Do I have to actually hand him
the envelope?

00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:54.671
Yes, but I'm gonna tell him in advance
that they're divorce papers.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.880
Nora says it doesn't
have to be so formal. Where is Henry?

00:32:57.958 --> 00:33:01.038
He's playing in the living room
with Sam, Jules, and Molly.

00:33:01.125 --> 00:33:02.285
Let's get them upstairs.

00:33:02.375 --> 00:33:04.375
- Charlie's gonna be here soon.
- Sam, go upstairs.

00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:06.708
So I'll tell Charlie what's happening,

00:33:06.791 --> 00:33:09.711
and, Cassie,
you then hand him the envelope.

00:33:09.791 --> 00:33:10.631
Okay...

00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:12.171
I just get nervous.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.460
Well, can you un-serve?

00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:17.076
- What do you mean? Like take it back?
- Yeah.

00:33:18.583 --> 00:33:19.923
- I think so.
- You should check.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.500
In case we change our minds...

00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:22.713
I'm not gonna change my mind.

00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:25.461
- Or we feel too bad for him.
- Maybe in case I do something wrong.

00:33:25.541 --> 00:33:27.461
Now you're both just
making me feel bad, okay?

00:33:27.541 --> 00:33:28.961
I'm sorry, I'm nervous!

00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:30.881
Well, we all are.

00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:32.668
And we love Charlie.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.750
You have to stop loving him, Mom.

00:33:34.833 --> 00:33:36.543
You can't be friends with him anymore.

00:33:36.625 --> 00:33:39.375
Charlie and I have our own relationship,

00:33:39.458 --> 00:33:41.538
independent of your marriage.

00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:45.035
Just like I'm still friends
with Cassie's ex, Jeff.

00:33:45.125 --> 00:33:46.495
Are you still seeing Jeff?

00:33:46.875 --> 00:33:48.705
An occasional lunch.

00:33:48.791 --> 00:33:50.041
I can't believe you!

00:33:50.125 --> 00:33:51.995
And he still wants his camera back,
by the way.

00:33:52.083 --> 00:33:55.423
Listen, nothing can be independent
of our marriage right now.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.500
I can't believe I even have to explain
this to you. Just be on my side, okay?

00:33:58.583 --> 00:34:01.423
- Okay.
- And stop seeing Jeff!

00:34:04.291 --> 00:34:05.961
Cassie, you're the server.

00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:08.671
Just let me practice a few times.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.380
I was never a good auditioner.

00:34:10.458 --> 00:34:13.288
- That's because you wanted it too bad.
- It's not an audition.

00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:14.955
I'll play Charlie.

00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:17.211
It's just my palms are so perspired.

00:34:17.291 --> 00:34:19.631
Sweetie, you're blotting the envelope.

00:34:19.708 --> 00:34:21.668
Maybe Nicole should play you.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:22.960
Did you really just say that?

00:34:23.041 --> 00:34:25.331
We don't need to practice.
This is not a performance.

00:34:25.625 --> 00:34:26.825
Did we finish the other wine already?

00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:27.746
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

00:34:28.541 --> 00:34:29.541
Oh!

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.330
Okay, let me get him.
You both go in the other room.

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:35.246
Cassie, you make sure that Henry
goes upstairs with Molly and Jules.

00:34:35.333 --> 00:34:36.423
Happening now.

00:34:38.208 --> 00:34:39.878
- Mom!
- I'm getting my wine.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.080
What?

00:34:42.166 --> 00:34:43.746
Henry's pooping
in the bathroom downstairs.

00:34:43.833 --> 00:34:45.293
Can we transfer him to the one upstairs?

00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:47.745
- I think it's mid-poop.
- Just grab him when he comes out.

00:34:47.833 --> 00:34:49.133
- Cassie?
- What?

00:34:49.208 --> 00:34:52.458
I'm putting the envelope
over here by the toaster.

00:34:52.541 --> 00:34:53.631
Copy you.

00:34:59.958 --> 00:35:00.998
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:35:01.083 --> 00:35:02.213
Where's Henry?

00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:03.171
He's pooping.

00:35:03.833 --> 00:35:05.133
Hi, Henry!

00:35:06.083 --> 00:35:07.633
Does this couch still open?

00:35:07.708 --> 00:35:08.828
Yeah.

00:35:08.916 --> 00:35:12.706
I got off the plane to a text, but don't
tell anyone yet. It's still a secret.

00:35:12.791 --> 00:35:13.751
Okay.

00:35:16.666 --> 00:35:17.996
I won a MacArthur grant.

00:35:18.958 --> 00:35:21.708
Charlie! Oh, my God, that's great!

00:35:21.791 --> 00:35:23.041
Congratulations.

00:35:23.125 --> 00:35:26.165
I'll say it 'cause you can't,
it's the Genius Grant. You're a genius.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.290
Oh, I'm really happy for you.
You deserve it.

00:35:28.375 --> 00:35:31.035
It's yours too.
We did all of this together.

00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:34.325
Thank you,
but it's yours, Charlie, you enjoy it.

00:35:35.125 --> 00:35:36.205
I'm starving.

00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:38.881
It's good money
and they parse it out over five years.

00:35:38.958 --> 00:35:41.128
It means I can keep everyone
in the theater company employed,

00:35:41.208 --> 00:35:43.288
- pay my credit card debt.
- So great.

00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.125
Of course I went instantly to,
"It's all downhill from here.

00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:47.788
Now my first Broadway play has to fail."

00:35:47.875 --> 00:35:48.705
No.

00:35:48.791 --> 00:35:50.631
We just started rehearsals again,
I don't know.

00:35:50.708 --> 00:35:53.128
You always don't know at this point
and then it gets there.

00:35:53.208 --> 00:35:54.918
Do I? 'Cause I don't remember.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.040
I know, it's true, it'll be great.

00:35:57.125 --> 00:35:58.665
Okay, I hope you're right.

00:35:59.083 --> 00:36:00.673
- Everyone says hi.
- Oh.

00:36:02.833 --> 00:36:04.583
Tell them hi. I miss everyone.

00:36:05.166 --> 00:36:06.536
You'll see them again when you come back.

00:36:06.625 --> 00:36:08.955
Gosh, a MacArthur, Broadway...

00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:10.291
it's so exciting.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.500
Congratulations, Charlie.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.330
Which bathroom?

00:36:22.083 --> 00:36:23.633
- What?
- Is he pooping?

00:36:24.625 --> 00:36:26.205
Oh, downstairs.

00:36:26.291 --> 00:36:27.291
Is your mom home?

00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:29.075
Yeah, she's upstairs.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.920
- Hey, how's it going?
- Nothing yet.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.250
- It's me.
- I know.

00:36:35.833 --> 00:36:37.253
- I just got here.
- Hi.

00:36:37.416 --> 00:36:39.036
- I brought you something.
- Yay.

00:36:39.125 --> 00:36:40.875
Mom's getting me a present too.

00:36:41.083 --> 00:36:42.793
- Why?
- For pooping.

00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:45.038
Oh.

00:36:46.958 --> 00:36:48.578
- I love you.
- I love you.

00:36:49.375 --> 00:36:51.665
I don't think we should reward him
for pooping anymore.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.000
I know, but he holds it in
and it's going on a week.

00:36:54.083 --> 00:36:56.753
- It's its own reward. G-ma!
- Charlie-bird!

00:36:58.791 --> 00:37:00.581
Stop it! Oh, God, I'm huge!

00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.916
- You're as light as a feather.
- Mom?

00:37:03.583 --> 00:37:05.173
Why didn't you respond to my last email?

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.790
Well, your emails are so articulate.
I get intimidated.

00:37:08.875 --> 00:37:10.415
- Mom, can you...
- Now I'll lift you!

00:37:11.875 --> 00:37:12.705
Mom?

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:14.750
Mom?

00:37:15.875 --> 00:37:17.285
- Mom?
- What?

00:37:17.375 --> 00:37:18.455
Upstairs.

00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:19.381
Oh.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.710
I'm gonna write ya back now.

00:37:25.541 --> 00:37:26.751
Cassie?

00:37:27.458 --> 00:37:28.458
Hey, Charlie.

00:37:28.541 --> 00:37:29.791
I like your haircut.

00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:31.286
Oh, thanks.

00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:34.421
- Mom?
- I'll go.

00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:36.918
Henry's calling you, Nicole!

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:37.880
I hear him.

00:37:38.958 --> 00:37:39.958
What's going on, Henry?

00:37:40.416 --> 00:37:42.036
Can you ask Mom to come?

00:37:44.041 --> 00:37:45.251
He wants you.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.500
What kind of pie is that?

00:37:52.208 --> 00:37:53.128
It's...

00:37:57.791 --> 00:37:58.671
pecan.

00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:01.751
- Did you make it?
- I don't know.

00:38:02.458 --> 00:38:03.628
No, it's store-bought.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:05.500
You know Joan's on Third?

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:06.923
Oh, yeah, it's good, right?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:07.920
What?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.170
The store, yeah.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.540
Jules and Molly love it.

00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:12.915
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:15.125
I'm just hot!

00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:17.883
I'll pour you some water.

00:38:19.416 --> 00:38:21.166
Nicole says you're doing a play?

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:22.710
I think you'd like it.

00:38:22.791 --> 00:38:26.291
It's a great unproduced play
by this really interesting British writer.

00:38:26.875 --> 00:38:28.665
- So you do an English accent?
- Yeah.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.790
- It's more northern England.
- Oh.

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:31.995
What does that sound like?

00:38:35.291 --> 00:38:36.881
You want a cup of tea, do ya?

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.036
Right. Good.

00:38:41.416 --> 00:38:43.246
Oh, thank you, missus.

00:38:43.583 --> 00:38:44.713
What is...

00:38:46.208 --> 00:38:49.208
- What's this?
- Oh, it's a manila envelope, love.

00:38:49.291 --> 00:38:50.251
Ooh, can I start over?

00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:51.423
Has my name on it.

00:38:56.416 --> 00:38:57.286
Oh.

00:38:57.625 --> 00:38:59.745
Jesus. Sorry.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.250
You're served.

00:39:03.375 --> 00:39:05.125
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

00:39:05.708 --> 00:39:07.248
I can't lie.

00:39:07.333 --> 00:39:08.923
You're being served.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.710
You guys are getting a di...
I don't know, I'm sorry.

00:39:17.875 --> 00:39:20.705
I was gonna warn you
so it didn't become a thing. I'm sorry.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.540
Feel like I'm in a dream.

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:39.038
We don't have a marriage anymore.

00:39:39.125 --> 00:39:40.745
I know you don't want the disruption,

00:39:40.833 --> 00:39:42.383
but you don't wanna be married.

00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:44.631
Not really.

00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:48.133
But I don't want this.

00:39:50.916 --> 00:39:53.166
What did you expect was gonna happen?

00:39:56.958 --> 00:39:59.328
I don't know,
I guess I didn't think it through,

00:39:59.416 --> 00:40:02.916
but I thought we agreed
we weren't going to use lawyers.

00:40:03.416 --> 00:40:04.246
I want...

00:40:05.458 --> 00:40:08.828
I don't know, I'm trying to say this
as undramatically as possible.

00:40:08.916 --> 00:40:10.126
I want...

00:40:11.708 --> 00:40:13.748
an entirely different kind of life.

00:40:14.916 --> 00:40:17.206
Let's wait until you finish this pilot
and come back to New York.

00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:19.211
Let's figure it out there,
at home, together.

00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:21.631
- Nora's known for being very fair.
- We don't need to do it with envelopes.

00:40:21.708 --> 00:40:22.828
- This is Nora?
- Yeah.

00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:25.251
She's great. I feel like
we could be friends with her.

00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:27.043
Why do I feel like that won't happen?

00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:28.375
It's just a formality.

00:40:28.791 --> 00:40:30.501
- Why...
- You don't respond right away.

00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:32.293
Why did Cassie have a pie?

00:40:32.375 --> 00:40:34.875
The pie was hers.
The pie wasn't part of it.

00:40:34.958 --> 00:40:36.078
Are you sure?

00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:37.826
What would the pie have to do
with anything?

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.210
I don't know. It somehow makes it worse.

00:40:41.458 --> 00:40:43.788
I'm sorry, but the pie was just a pie.

00:40:44.916 --> 00:40:45.916
So what...

00:40:48.958 --> 00:40:49.958
what do I do?

00:40:52.791 --> 00:40:54.041
You get a lawyer too.

00:40:57.875 --> 00:40:59.325
"'Well, I guess I better be going.'"

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.210
Stuart rose from the ditch,
climbed into his car...

00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:06.293
and started up the road
that led toward the north.

00:41:07.416 --> 00:41:10.166
The sun was just coming up
over the hills on his right.

00:41:11.166 --> 00:41:14.536
As he peered ahead into the great land
that stretched before him,

00:41:15.166 --> 00:41:16.576
the way seemed long...

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:18.831
but the sky was bright.

00:41:19.666 --> 00:41:22.376
"And he somehow felt
he was headed in the right direction."

00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:26.998
I forgot it ended that way.

00:41:28.583 --> 00:41:31.673
Yeah, wow, Stuart really overreacted,
didn't you think?

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.290
He was upset about his boat.

00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:40.041
Dad, you go away.

00:41:41.125 --> 00:41:43.035
Mom, you stay.

00:41:43.541 --> 00:41:46.461
- Hey, Daddy just got here.
- It's okay.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:48.710
Love you.

00:41:52.458 --> 00:41:56.748
You can come back and wake me up
and read to me later, Daddy, okay?

00:41:57.333 --> 00:41:58.173
Okay.

00:42:00.666 --> 00:42:03.786
- Will you come sleep in my bed later?
- Yeah.

00:42:13.583 --> 00:42:14.503
Oh.

00:42:14.583 --> 00:42:16.633
Hang in there, Charlie-bird.

00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:17.668
Thanks, G-ma.

00:42:47.333 --> 00:42:48.923
He's in a mommy phase right now.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.830
It's okay.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.880
I'm sorry. I drank too much wine.

00:43:02.416 --> 00:43:04.166
- I can imagine.
- Didn't eat dinner.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.500
Stressful time.

00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:07.751
I hope Henry didn't notice.

00:43:07.833 --> 00:43:08.833
I'm sure he didn't.

00:43:08.916 --> 00:43:10.626
Now that I'm a parent,
I realize my parents

00:43:10.708 --> 00:43:12.328
were probably drunk all the time with me.

00:43:12.416 --> 00:43:13.246
Yeah.

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:14.791
I'm sorry again.

00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:17.166
Thanks.

00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:19.463
Where are you staying?

00:43:23.125 --> 00:43:24.785
Oh, well, I...

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:27.420
hadn't...

00:43:31.666 --> 00:43:32.956
I guess I'll...

00:43:34.958 --> 00:43:37.248
There's a new hotel on Highland that's...

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.500
supposedly not too expensive
and pretty nice.

00:43:42.083 --> 00:43:43.673
Oh, okay, I'll check it out.

00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:46.131
Again, that's great about the MacArthur.

00:43:46.916 --> 00:43:47.746
Thanks.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.880
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:01.580
Thanks.

00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:10.415
- Fuck.
- What?

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.130
She's being represented by Nora.

00:44:13.208 --> 00:44:14.578
She's supposedly very fair?

00:44:14.666 --> 00:44:16.456
All right, here's the fact, Jack.

00:44:17.083 --> 00:44:20.003
I charge $950 an hour.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:21.540
Ted is $400.

00:44:22.083 --> 00:44:24.753
If you have a stupid question,
you call Ted.

00:44:26.416 --> 00:44:29.246
To start, we'll need a $25,000 retainer.

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:31.333
- That's more than I can...
- And all your financials.

00:44:31.416 --> 00:44:32.876
We need to do a forensic accounting.

00:44:32.958 --> 00:44:36.248
Which runs anywhere from ten to $20,000.

00:44:37.083 --> 00:44:39.753
But if we can all agree right away,
it shouldn't get too bad,

00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:42.383
- right?
- You were married here in LA?

00:44:42.458 --> 00:44:44.578
Yes, because her mom and sister
are out here

00:44:44.666 --> 00:44:47.376
- and I'm not close with my family.
- Your son was born out here?

00:44:47.458 --> 00:44:50.958
Yes, because, again, her mom
and sister are out here and I'm not...

00:44:51.041 --> 00:44:52.421
So you got married here,

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.210
your kid was born here...

00:44:55.875 --> 00:44:57.125
and she served you here?

00:44:57.208 --> 00:44:59.038
Yeah, but we lived in New York.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.830
Why?

00:45:02.375 --> 00:45:04.955
- There a problem?
- We'll have to reshape the narrative.

00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:08.581
If you're serious
about having your child in New York,

00:45:08.875 --> 00:45:10.535
this is what I suggest.

00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:13.415
You take your kid...
Did you say his name was Fred?

00:45:14.333 --> 00:45:15.833
- Henry.
- Henry?

00:45:16.083 --> 00:45:17.293
Why did I say Fred?

00:45:17.375 --> 00:45:18.875
Well, I have a kid named Fred.

00:45:18.958 --> 00:45:22.538
You take Henry to New York
with you right now.

00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:24.745
Then we file an action in New York.

00:45:25.125 --> 00:45:26.745
We make this a New York case.

00:45:26.833 --> 00:45:28.833
We need to make an argument
you're a New York-based family.

00:45:28.916 --> 00:45:29.746
Well, we are.

00:45:29.833 --> 00:45:32.833
Otherwise, you'll probably never
see your kid outside of LA again.

00:45:32.916 --> 00:45:34.496
Really? No.

00:45:34.625 --> 00:45:37.705
It's very hard to convince the courts
to move a kid.

00:45:37.916 --> 00:45:41.576
As soon as you let your wife
and child leave New York,

00:45:41.666 --> 00:45:43.996
you made life very difficult for yourself.

00:45:44.083 --> 00:45:47.883
Yes, but as I said, we're
a New York family, that's just a fact.

00:45:49.375 --> 00:45:50.745
She's here temporarily.

00:45:51.166 --> 00:45:53.626
Then why do you think
she served you out here?

00:45:54.333 --> 00:45:56.583
I don't... know,

00:45:56.875 --> 00:45:58.415
but Henry wants to
go back to New York.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.290
No, don't quote your kid.

00:46:01.208 --> 00:46:03.458
He's just telling you
what you wanna hear.

00:46:04.333 --> 00:46:07.173
And trust me,
he's telling her the opposite.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:08.750
Let me have the Barbara file!

00:46:16.583 --> 00:46:17.583
What's...

00:46:19.583 --> 00:46:21.003
"Exit Goat"?

00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:24.213
Exit Ghost. It's the name
of my theater company.

00:46:24.291 --> 00:46:25.541
You're a director?

00:46:25.625 --> 00:46:26.705
Theater director, yeah.

00:46:27.125 --> 00:46:28.455
Anything I've seen?

00:46:28.541 --> 00:46:29.881
I don't know. What have you seen?

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.540
Our production of Electra
is moving to Broadway...

00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:36.785
which is exciting.

00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:39.125
We have to make sure
that money is protected.

00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:41.628
I mean, it's theater,
so it's not a lot of money.

00:46:41.708 --> 00:46:44.828
I basically put whatever money I make
back in the theater.

00:46:44.916 --> 00:46:45.876
I wonder.

00:46:45.958 --> 00:46:47.748
Do we ask for support?

00:46:48.333 --> 00:46:49.923
- Interesting.
- From Nicole?

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.330
I'm not going to do that.

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.495
Does your wife's family have money?

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.750
Her mother has some from her TV career.

00:46:57.833 --> 00:46:59.253
And her father died.

00:46:59.333 --> 00:47:03.673
Well, we could say that we don't want
her mother to see the kid,

00:47:04.041 --> 00:47:05.381
draw her into the case.

00:47:05.458 --> 00:47:08.498
In that instance,
her mother could pay your legal fees.

00:47:08.916 --> 00:47:09.746
No.

00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:12.075
I'm very close to her mom.

00:47:12.291 --> 00:47:15.421
- Nicole's family has been my family...
- Yeah, but that's gonna change.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.210
And I suggest you get used to it.

00:47:17.875 --> 00:47:19.745
We need to hire a private investigator.

00:47:20.333 --> 00:47:21.753
Really? I mean...

00:47:23.375 --> 00:47:25.875
- Really?
- Does your wife do drugs or anything?

00:47:25.958 --> 00:47:26.788
Coke?

00:47:27.416 --> 00:47:28.496
Not in any real way.

00:47:28.958 --> 00:47:31.208
Well, we're not gonna win
if she's the perfect mother.

00:47:31.708 --> 00:47:33.418
She was addicted to Tums for a while.

00:47:35.166 --> 00:47:38.206
Hey, it wasn't nothing.
She was up to a tube a day.

00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:40.081
Have you noticed anyone following you?

00:47:40.166 --> 00:47:40.996
No.

00:47:42.458 --> 00:47:43.878
Well, keep an eye out.

00:47:43.958 --> 00:47:46.038
Look, you need to be prepared for the fact

00:47:46.125 --> 00:47:50.165
that Nora is gonna portray you
as a neglectful, absent father.

00:47:50.625 --> 00:47:51.745
But I'm not.

00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:52.883
You live in New York.

00:47:52.958 --> 00:47:54.538
You're consumed with your work.

00:47:55.166 --> 00:47:58.416
She and your kid are out here, struggling.

00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:00.705
Nora's gonna use that strategy.

00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:02.001
I'm sure of it.

00:48:02.083 --> 00:48:03.333
But Nicole's not going to lie.

00:48:03.416 --> 00:48:06.286
Listen, if we start from a place
of reasonable,

00:48:06.375 --> 00:48:08.665
and they start from a place of crazy,

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:12.710
when we settle, we'll be somewhere
between reasonable and crazy.

00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:13.671
Which is still crazy.

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:15.330
Half of crazy is crazy.

00:48:15.416 --> 00:48:18.376
You know what people say, "Criminal
lawyers see bad people at their best",

00:48:18.458 --> 00:48:20.708
divorce lawyers see good people
at their worst."

00:48:20.791 --> 00:48:23.501
Before this is all over,
you're gonna hate me and Ted

00:48:23.583 --> 00:48:26.213
just because of what we represent
in your life.

00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:27.381
I'm sure you're right.

00:48:27.458 --> 00:48:28.828
So tell me the story again.

00:48:28.916 --> 00:48:31.326
- You came out here to see your kid.
- Maybe I'm not explaining this...

00:48:31.416 --> 00:48:33.076
- She serves you.
- We're friendly, we're fine...

00:48:33.166 --> 00:48:34.666
- What a bitch.
- We're figuring this out.

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.880
She's not a bitch.

00:48:35.958 --> 00:48:38.708
Thanks, but this isn't...
We're doing it a different way.

00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.673
And I can't even close to afford this.

00:48:42.166 --> 00:48:46.126
I gotta get back to New York.
I have a Broadway play and rehearsals.

00:48:50.416 --> 00:48:53.746
I was the hot shit at that time.

00:48:53.833 --> 00:48:56.383
Young, very sexy,

00:48:56.458 --> 00:48:58.788
with a great head of hair.

00:48:58.875 --> 00:49:01.495
I so appreciate that Charlie
gave me this opportunity.

00:49:01.583 --> 00:49:03.043
Or maybe I should thank Nicole.

00:49:03.125 --> 00:49:05.705
I heard Nicole's pilot went to series,
so she's moving to LA.

00:49:05.791 --> 00:49:07.421
And they put Henry in school out there.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.830
Is Charlie moving too?

00:49:08.916 --> 00:49:09.996
Not Charlie.

00:49:10.083 --> 00:49:11.173
He won't abandon us.

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.790
And you can't do theater in LA.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.330
Charlie said she and Henry
are coming back to New York

00:49:15.416 --> 00:49:17.076
when she finishes filming her show.

00:49:17.166 --> 00:49:18.536
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:49:18.625 --> 00:49:21.535
Nicole was never gonna stay in New York,
that was obvious.

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.625
She was probably
planning this move all along.

00:49:23.708 --> 00:49:25.578
When she sees an opportunity,

00:49:25.666 --> 00:49:27.036
believe me, she takes it.

00:49:27.125 --> 00:49:30.575
Well, LA is nice. The space.

00:49:30.666 --> 00:49:33.996
Four-time Oscar winner, sucking my...

00:49:34.083 --> 00:49:36.133
- Okay, how is everyone today?
- Hey!

00:49:36.208 --> 00:49:38.458
Nobody get too close.
I think I caught Donna's cold.

00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:41.211
- Sorry, Charlie.
- I'm expecting a Skype call from Henry,

00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:42.921
so I might have to step out.

00:49:44.041 --> 00:49:46.461
So, Charlie, what you're going through now

00:49:46.541 --> 00:49:49.831
is going to be horrible,
but it will be over.

00:49:49.916 --> 00:49:51.036
Thanks, Frank.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.670
- Another thing.
- Yeah?

00:49:53.208 --> 00:49:57.288
Fuck as many people
as you can right now.

00:49:57.375 --> 00:49:59.495
Women, men.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.880
- Take what I said seriously.
- You might need help wrapping the gauze.

00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:04.038
It needs to stay tight.

00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:05.825
Okay, I'm confused.

00:50:05.916 --> 00:50:07.956
What scene
is the Invisible Man outfit for?

00:50:08.041 --> 00:50:09.831
No, that's my Halloween costume,

00:50:09.916 --> 00:50:12.286
and the Frankenstein is for Henry.

00:50:12.375 --> 00:50:14.245
Oh, it's Frankenstein.

00:50:14.333 --> 00:50:17.383
He's coming here this weekend.
We're gonna trick or treat in the Slope.

00:50:17.458 --> 00:50:19.708
I made it more James Whale
than Kenneth Branagh.

00:50:19.791 --> 00:50:20.631
Perfect.

00:50:20.708 --> 00:50:21.748
Can I talk to you?

00:50:22.375 --> 00:50:23.955
Yeah, over...

00:50:24.666 --> 00:50:27.076
I've typed up the blocking
from the last two rehearsals,

00:50:27.166 --> 00:50:30.876
and here are the director notes
from that Danish production from the '70s.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Where'd you find it?

00:50:33.083 --> 00:50:34.633
The library, duh.

00:50:35.875 --> 00:50:37.245
Can I come over tonight?

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.460
Mary Ann, it's too hard now.

00:50:40.541 --> 00:50:42.501
I just can't be with anyone right now.

00:50:42.583 --> 00:50:45.543
But we did it when you were married
and we shouldn't have done it.

00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:47.825
And now that you're not married,
shouldn't we be doing it?

00:50:47.916 --> 00:50:50.956
I'm not not married yet.

00:50:51.375 --> 00:50:52.705
You're torturing yourself.

00:50:53.333 --> 00:50:55.333
Just make sure
everything doesn't go to hell.

00:50:56.458 --> 00:50:58.538
- I'm relying on you, okay?
- Fine.

00:50:58.625 --> 00:50:59.455
Thanks.

00:50:59.541 --> 00:51:01.461
I wish you'd accept generosity better.

00:51:01.541 --> 00:51:02.541
Hold on. Let me...

00:51:03.041 --> 00:51:05.001
- Hello?
- Is this Charlie Barber?

00:51:05.625 --> 00:51:06.455
Yes.

00:51:06.541 --> 00:51:08.291
Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw.

00:51:08.375 --> 00:51:10.125
I represent your wife, Nicole Barber.

00:51:10.208 --> 00:51:11.038
Hi.

00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:12.415
Do you have an attorney yet?

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.330
No.

00:51:13.416 --> 00:51:15.786
Okay, then it's okay for me
to talk to you directly, okay?

00:51:15.875 --> 00:51:16.705
Okay.

00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:20.331
I'm calling because we haven't
received your response to our filing.

00:51:20.416 --> 00:51:23.746
Yeah, I've been rehearsing this play
and flying back and forth to LA.

00:51:23.833 --> 00:51:26.043
You're going to need
to file your response.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.330
Nicole said there was no rush.

00:51:29.416 --> 00:51:31.956
It's been more than 30 days
since you were served.

00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:33.671
By law, you're meant to respond within...

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.290
I didn't like the first lawyer I met.

00:51:35.375 --> 00:51:37.705
It says that very clearly
on the document you were given.

00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:38.791
Did you read it?

00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:40.705
Yeah, but I thought
that's just what it says.

00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:42.461
We weren't even gonna do it
with lawyers.

00:51:43.416 --> 00:51:45.826
Charlie, I think I shouldn't
tuck in my shirt.

00:51:45.916 --> 00:51:48.666
- Nicole said I could take my time.
- And we've let you take your time.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.750
- It comes out during the love scene.
- Could you hold?

00:51:50.833 --> 00:51:51.883
What love scene?

00:51:51.958 --> 00:51:53.288
When I hug Beth.

00:51:53.375 --> 00:51:54.375
You don't hug Beth.

00:51:54.458 --> 00:51:56.788
I think it's something
we should explore.

00:51:56.875 --> 00:51:59.785
Can't you just tuck it in tighter
or get Donna to safety pin it?

00:51:59.875 --> 00:52:01.915
I also have a kind of a thing

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.460
- about tucking things in.
- Charlie?

00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:06.001
If you don't file your response,

00:52:06.083 --> 00:52:08.883
we'll file a request
for default judgment against you.

00:52:08.958 --> 00:52:11.208
Insecurities about my figure.

00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:12.581
- Charlie?
- Yes, sorry.

00:52:12.666 --> 00:52:14.746
Default judgment, what does that mean?
Don't hug Beth.

00:52:14.833 --> 00:52:17.213
We'll be able to lay claim
to whatever we want.

00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:19.001
What do you mean,
whatever you want of what?

00:52:19.083 --> 00:52:21.383
Your apartment, your things,
everything you own.

00:52:21.458 --> 00:52:22.328
We?

00:52:22.416 --> 00:52:25.416
She and I already discussed this.
We don't own that much stuff.

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.750
She can have whatever she wants.

00:52:26.833 --> 00:52:29.633
And it means we'll set the number
of child support at its highest level

00:52:29.708 --> 00:52:31.828
and claim full custody of your child.

00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:35.041
Full custody?

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:37.960
I mean, that's not even...

00:52:38.041 --> 00:52:39.461
This is what the law says.

00:52:40.416 --> 00:52:43.126
Nicole's not going to do that.
I mean, she won't.

00:52:43.708 --> 00:52:47.248
Charlie, I represent Nicole, and she's
aware of everything I'm saying to you.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.040
I just spoke to her this morning.

00:52:49.458 --> 00:52:52.288
Well, I spoke to her five minutes
before I got on the call.

00:52:55.833 --> 00:52:56.883
Okay, so what do I do?

00:52:56.958 --> 00:52:59.248
You need to get a lawyer
and respond immediately.

00:52:59.333 --> 00:53:02.673
Nicole wants to do this amicably,
but you're leaving us no other option.

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.420
I'll get a lawyer.
Can I get a lawyer here?

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.580
- I don't know where "here" is.
- New York.

00:53:06.666 --> 00:53:09.166
Ah! That's what all that honking is?

00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:11.666
No, you'll have to come to LA
and meet people in LA.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:12.710
I'm rehearsing a...

00:53:12.791 --> 00:53:15.631
If you don't respond in Los Angeles
by Friday, you'll leave us no choice.

00:53:16.208 --> 00:53:17.828
What? Which line?

00:53:18.416 --> 00:53:20.956
I have to take this.
Can you hold on a second, Charlie?

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.080
Me and Mommy are in the middle
of a super secret treasure hunt.

00:53:52.041 --> 00:53:53.831
I thought the plane landed at 9:00.

00:53:53.916 --> 00:53:54.786
What are you wearing?

00:53:54.875 --> 00:53:55.875
Sock pants.

00:53:55.958 --> 00:53:57.418
It did. What are sock pants?

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.420
He doesn't like to feel the breeze
on his legs.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:00.880
He dressed himself.

00:54:00.958 --> 00:54:02.668
There are long pants. Can I talk to you?

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.670
- It's almost noon.
- There was traffic. We gotta get going.

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:07.420
- Why don't we ever do a treasure hunt?
- Henry, can you wait a minute?

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.710
No talking alone.

00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:11.001
Just one bit of talking alone,
then I'll be right there.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:12.830
I got a call from your lawyer.

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:15.416
She said you'd take everything and...

00:54:16.458 --> 00:54:18.498
custody and everything
if I didn't respond.

00:54:18.583 --> 00:54:20.333
It's better if we let the lawyers do this.

00:54:20.416 --> 00:54:21.996
But she's saying things
I don't think you mean.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.420
Henry, we need to get going.

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.040
I don't wanna go now.

00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:28.245
- Have you gotten a lawyer yet?
- That's what I'm here to do.

00:54:28.333 --> 00:54:29.883
Come on, Henry. I'm in a rush.

00:54:29.958 --> 00:54:31.128
I've three more clues.

00:54:31.208 --> 00:54:33.748
Why'd you start a treasure hunt
or whatever so close to my arrival?

00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:35.915
You were late. We were killing time.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.380
Honey, come. We're gonna finish
the treasure hunt later.

00:54:38.458 --> 00:54:39.458
- I'm gonna be rich.
- Okay.

00:54:40.333 --> 00:54:42.293
You're gonna go with your daddy,
it's gonna be fun.

00:54:42.375 --> 00:54:45.625
And I've got a present for you
when you get back as a reward.

00:54:46.541 --> 00:54:47.711
He's not going to the dentist.

00:54:47.791 --> 00:54:49.711
- I'm trying to help.
- I'm staying here.

00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:50.671
Come on.

00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:55.455
Henry?

00:55:01.166 --> 00:55:02.326
Got the booster?

00:55:02.416 --> 00:55:03.576
I have a booster.

00:55:05.375 --> 00:55:07.075
Oh, wait, no, it's not in.

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.380
What's not in?

00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:10.751
The seat's not connected.

00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:15.673
I asked the rental company to install it.

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:18.460
I think they can't
for liability reasons.

00:55:18.666 --> 00:55:20.916
- Do you know how these things...
- Let me just... Here, if you...

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.540
- There should be a clip to clip onto.
- You have to.dig...

00:55:28.791 --> 00:55:29.831
Fuck!

00:55:29.916 --> 00:55:31.826
- Why fuck?
- Something sharp.

00:55:31.916 --> 00:55:33.166
Can't I stay with Mom?

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:34.290
- No.
- Why not?

00:55:34.375 --> 00:55:36.375
It's my time with you.
I just flew 3,000 miles.

00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:37.328
I don't want to.

00:55:37.416 --> 00:55:38.826
Henry, get in the fuckin' car!

00:55:41.166 --> 00:55:43.286
I'm sorry, but, Jesus,
get in the fuckin' car.

00:55:48.416 --> 00:55:50.666
How do you spell Lego Bionicles?

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:52.630
That's two words.
What does Lego start with?

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:54.173
Just tell me.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.420
- Don't you wanna learn it?
- No.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.960
- It's on the box, anyway.
- I...

00:55:57.041 --> 00:55:58.251
Then what?

00:55:58.333 --> 00:56:01.083
E. You know,
everyone at the theater says hi.

00:56:01.166 --> 00:56:02.956
Hi. Then what?

00:56:03.041 --> 00:56:04.581
A "G" sound.

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:06.630
- Are you excited for Halloween?
- J?

00:56:06.708 --> 00:56:07.578
G.

00:56:07.666 --> 00:56:09.286
- Then what?
- And an "O" sound.

00:56:09.375 --> 00:56:11.495
- O?
- Are you excited for Halloween?

00:56:11.583 --> 00:56:12.583
Yeah.

00:56:12.666 --> 00:56:14.166
Brought both our costumes.

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:16.460
I'm going as a store-bought ninja.

00:56:16.541 --> 00:56:18.671
But we agreed.
I had Donna make you a Frankenstein.

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:21.920
- I don't wanna be a Frankenstein anymore.
- Are you sure?

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:24.710
Maybe just look at it.

00:56:25.125 --> 00:56:27.955
It's awesome. We'll be Frankenstein
and the Invisible Man.

00:56:28.041 --> 00:56:30.131
Mom bought me a ninja costume

00:56:30.208 --> 00:56:32.828
which is better because it costs more.

00:56:32.916 --> 00:56:34.576
Technically, the Frankenstein cost more

00:56:34.666 --> 00:56:36.626
when you factor in Donna's time
and the materials.

00:56:36.708 --> 00:56:38.958
The cousins are also gonna be ninjas.

00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:40.751
But Henry,
we went through all this trouble.

00:56:44.416 --> 00:56:45.536
Okay.

00:56:45.625 --> 00:56:46.625
Whatever you want.

00:56:52.083 --> 00:56:53.503
Please take the ticket.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.790
- Dad, you're too far.
- I know.

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.383
Please take the ticket.

00:57:09.291 --> 00:57:11.711
So I'm not comfortable
leaving the bags in the car

00:57:11.791 --> 00:57:13.961
where I've given the key to someone
I don't really know.

00:57:14.041 --> 00:57:15.131
I've been here.

00:57:15.208 --> 00:57:18.458
It's an office building,
so you've been to places like this before.

00:57:19.083 --> 00:57:20.633
I remember those fish.

00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:23.171
A lot of fish look the same.

00:57:23.708 --> 00:57:24.788
Can I help you?

00:57:24.875 --> 00:57:27.415
I'm Charlie Barber.
I have a 1:30 with Dan Cohen.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.080
Oh, hi. Where's your little man?

00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:32.626
I don't have it this time.
I keep my skeletons at my mom's.

00:57:32.708 --> 00:57:33.538
Okay.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.040
Oh, okay.

00:57:36.291 --> 00:57:38.291
I'm sorry. We tried to reach you.

00:57:38.375 --> 00:57:40.075
Mr. Cohen wanted me to apologize.

00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:43.286
He can't see you because apparently
your wife already met with him

00:57:43.375 --> 00:57:45.625
on the 7th of August about representation.

00:57:46.458 --> 00:57:47.918
But she hired somebody else.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.290
- Nora...
- Fanshaw?

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.130
But unfortunately, because she consulted
with Mr. Cohen already,

00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:55.078
he's legally barred from representing you.

00:57:55.791 --> 00:57:56.631
Oh.

00:57:56.708 --> 00:57:58.248
- Should we feed the fish?
- Yeah.

00:57:59.041 --> 00:58:01.461
- It happens all the time.
- Really?

00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:03.541
If you have a ticket,
I can validate your parking.

00:58:04.291 --> 00:58:05.251
Oh.

00:58:05.375 --> 00:58:08.325
It's common that people meet
with as many lawyers as possible

00:58:08.416 --> 00:58:10.416
so that their spouse has limited options.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.540
Oh, I don't think
she would've done it deliberately.

00:58:12.625 --> 00:58:13.875
You'd be surprised.

00:58:14.125 --> 00:58:16.745
Can all of them, like,
breathe out of the water?

00:58:18.375 --> 00:58:20.325
Do you go to a lot of offices
with your mom?

00:58:20.625 --> 00:58:21.745
Not so many.

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.633
Like 11.

00:58:24.708 --> 00:58:27.328
I don't think anyone
would have stealed the bags, Daddy.

00:58:27.416 --> 00:58:28.626
I need somebody today.

00:58:28.708 --> 00:58:31.208
If I don't respond by tomorrow,
she said I could lose custody.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.210
I didn't know who else to call.
There's gotta be someone she didn't meet.

00:58:34.291 --> 00:58:35.331
I have a name for you.

00:58:36.541 --> 00:58:38.291
Bert Spitz.

00:58:38.833 --> 00:58:42.173
He was the entertainment lawyer
at Roberto's agency.

00:58:42.625 --> 00:58:43.495
Great.

00:58:43.666 --> 00:58:47.246
But then he kind of got pushed
into retirement a few years ago,

00:58:47.333 --> 00:58:49.083
and he went into family law.

00:58:49.166 --> 00:58:50.996
- I called him.
- Thank you, G-ma.

00:58:51.083 --> 00:58:53.753
- And he can see you today at three.
- Aw, shit.

00:58:54.458 --> 00:58:56.998
We never had this conversation,
Charlie-bird.

00:58:57.083 --> 00:58:59.383
- You got it. I love you.
- Dad!

00:58:59.458 --> 00:59:01.958
- I need a new burger.
- Why?

00:59:02.125 --> 00:59:06.415
Because you made us carry your bags
into the restaurant, I dropped it.

00:59:07.875 --> 00:59:09.995
That's fine. I'll give you mine.
Get in the car.

00:59:10.458 --> 00:59:13.418
Why did you bring me today
if you couldn't hang out with me?

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.170
Because I've been away and wanna see you.

00:59:16.083 --> 00:59:19.423
Jamie Tuber has a little sister

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.040
named Lily Tuber.

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:24.665
- Yeah.
- And Lily Tuber is really bossy.

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:30.130
Getting divorced with a kid can be
one of the hardest things you'll ever do.

00:59:32.083 --> 00:59:33.883
It's like a death without a body.

00:59:36.041 --> 00:59:39.331
I know personally.
I've been there four different times.

00:59:39.416 --> 00:59:40.706
You've been divorced four times?

00:59:41.208 --> 00:59:42.248
Married four times.

00:59:42.666 --> 00:59:43.666
Three divorces.

00:59:44.833 --> 00:59:46.503
This last one will stick, God willing.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.710
That's why I graduated into family law,

00:59:50.041 --> 00:59:52.211
to help people survive this painful time.

00:59:53.958 --> 00:59:55.208
Here's how I see it.

00:59:56.541 --> 00:59:59.581
If we get bogged down in "who did this"
and "who did that,"

00:59:59.666 --> 01:00:01.376
and "I don't want to pay the two dollars,"

01:00:01.458 --> 01:00:03.998
it'll just cost you more
in money and time and...

01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.125
emotional stress,

01:00:06.208 --> 01:00:08.708
and you'll probably end up
with the same result anyway.

01:00:08.791 --> 01:00:09.961
Right.

01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:13.331
I mean, I agree with that philosophy.
She does too, I'm sure.

01:00:13.416 --> 01:00:15.916
And I always go with the truth,
no matter where that takes us.

01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:18.416
Most people in my business
make up the truth

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.000
so they can get where they need to go.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.670
You're just transactions to them.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.630
I like to think of you as people.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:25.828
Oh, okay, good.

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:28.043
And not just you, her too.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:28.995
Yes.

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.173
You know, this can be
a really ugly process.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.880
But I also believe
it doesn't have to be terrible.

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:35.575
I'm glad to hear you say that.

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:40.083
I'd love to keep expenses down
as much as possible.

01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:41.076
Of course you do.

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:45.750
I charge 450 an hour
and I need a $10,000 retainer to start.

01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:49.501
I'll see if I can get an advance
on the Broadway transfer.

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:52.383
And keep in mind
you'll have to pay for her lawyer.

01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:53.918
Oh. I didn't...

01:00:56.333 --> 01:00:58.293
- What?
- Well, at least part of her.

01:00:58.375 --> 01:00:59.825
It doesn't make sense, does it?

01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:03.423
I mean, you're doing this
because you love your kid.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.330
And in doing so, you're draining money
from your kid's education.

01:01:07.416 --> 01:01:09.376
- It seems ridiculous.
- Oh, it is.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:10.786
It is, boy.

01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:14.171
We'll have to respond right away.

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:17.540
Your son goes to school out here?

01:01:17.625 --> 01:01:19.785
Yeah, temporarily, we agreed.

01:01:20.166 --> 01:01:22.826
Her pilot went to series
and I wanted to accommodate her.

01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:25.126
She's often felt we do things on my terms.

01:01:25.208 --> 01:01:27.328
Be a better husband in divorce, huh?

01:01:27.708 --> 01:01:30.168
I guess something like that,
but we live in New York.

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:33.463
Well, with your kid
going to school out here,

01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:34.921
the court may see it differently.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.040
Will we go to court?

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.955
No, we don't wanna go to court.

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:41.998
Courts in California are a disaster.
That's just how we have to think about it.

01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:45.078
I'm not sure these are my glasses.

01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:46.706
Where are you living while you're here?

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.130
In a hotel right now.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:49.418
No, a hotel doesn't look good.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.960
- To who?
- The court.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:54.076
- You said we weren't going to go to court.
- No, of course.

01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:56.876
We have to prepare to go to court,
hoping we don't go to court.

01:01:56.958 --> 01:01:57.788
Okay.

01:01:58.291 --> 01:01:59.711
You should get a place in LA.

01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:03.081
And get a place near her.
It looks better for custody reasons.

01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:05.286
She's in West Hollywood.
That'll be expensive.

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:07.125
I guess I could rent
our New York apartment.

01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:08.128
Don't rent it.

01:02:08.708 --> 01:02:11.038
You have to continue to prove
New York residence.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:13.375
And, of course, you have a place in LA.

01:02:13.458 --> 01:02:15.748
It's hard to show you all live
in New York, isn't it?

01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:16.713
So...

01:02:17.291 --> 01:02:18.381
what do I do?

01:02:18.875 --> 01:02:22.245
I recommend you spend as much time
as you can with your son.

01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:25.081
Many people fight for that time,

01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:26.376
then they don't even use it.

01:02:27.125 --> 01:02:28.535
They just wanna win.

01:02:28.625 --> 01:02:30.535
This shouldn't be that complicated, right?

01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:32.498
I mean, we're a New York family.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:35.578
I think it's all
pretty straightforward. Right?

01:02:36.166 --> 01:02:37.456
I hope so, yes.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.170
I see no reason...

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:43.000
you both love your child,

01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:45.461
you respect each other,

01:02:45.541 --> 01:02:47.581
why this shouldn't be
relatively pain-free.

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:50.786
- Right.
- I think you have my glasses.

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.380
That makes sense.

01:02:55.458 --> 01:02:56.628
What have you been doing?

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.168
Reading this magazine.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.210
You were reading California Lawyer?

01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:01.131
Yeah.

01:03:01.208 --> 01:03:02.668
Okay, I'm almost done.

01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:06.291
I wouldn't expect too much from that cat.

01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:10.381
What kind of pet do you want?

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:11.288
I don't know...

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:13.995
I want you to know
that eventually this will all be over,

01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:15.883
and whatever we win or lose...

01:03:16.416 --> 01:03:19.416
it'll be the two of you
having to figure this out together.

01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:21.246
Thank you.

01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:24.543
Your the first person in this process
who's spoken to me like a human.

01:03:30.166 --> 01:03:32.626
You remind me of myself
on my second marriage.

01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:38.286
Come! Oh!

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.290
You have fun with Daddy?

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:41.665
We drove around to offices.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.170
Oh. Do you wanna see your ninja costume?

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.540
It's on G-ma's bed.

01:03:45.625 --> 01:03:46.745
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:51.708
You know, I had Donna build him
this whole Frankenstein thing

01:03:51.791 --> 01:03:53.251
with plugs and...

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:55.713
Yeah, well, the cousins are ninjas,
so he wanted to do that...

01:03:55.791 --> 01:03:57.541
He and I had decided together.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.535
Oh, well, I can't make him
be Frankenstein.

01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:01.625
I'm not asking you to,
but maybe you can help me out a little.

01:04:01.708 --> 01:04:04.668
I'll leave the Frankenstein here, maybe
you can nudge him in that direction.

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:06.131
I'll try.

01:04:07.791 --> 01:04:08.711
What's the...

01:04:09.791 --> 01:04:11.751
Did you dye your hair again?
Is that for your show?

01:04:12.291 --> 01:04:14.921
No, this is me. It was this way
when I saw you before.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.790
I know, but I didn't say anything then.

01:04:17.958 --> 01:04:19.128
You don't like it?

01:04:19.208 --> 01:04:22.498
No, I guess it's fine.
Is it shorter? I prefer longer but...

01:04:25.833 --> 01:04:27.543
Sorry, it's just absurd.

01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:29.246
Is everything okay?

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:30.963
Yeah. Why?

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:34.038
You seem, I don't know,
like something is...

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:35.245
Everything's fine.

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:39.000
Okay, I'm gonna check in at the hotel,

01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:42.173
but I should be able
to get to you guys by 5:00, 5:30...

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:44.500
We're going to Cassie's
in Pasadena,

01:04:44.583 --> 01:04:46.293
and trick-or-treating with the cousins.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.285
- Cassie lives in Pasadena now?
- Yes.

01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:51.325
- She and Sam moved there a couple months...
- I don't really know Pasadena.

01:04:51.416 --> 01:04:54.246
- I'll figure it out. What's the address?
- My mom is looking forward to it.

01:04:54.333 --> 01:04:55.833
- I'll text Sam.
- Cassie and Sam are mad.

01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:57.831
- Mad at who?
- You.

01:04:58.416 --> 01:05:00.076
- Cassie and Sam?
- You can understand that.

01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:02.376
So I think we should probably
do separate Halloweens.

01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:04.955
But if you're okay with it,
then shouldn't they be okay with it?

01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:07.291
- Let's do it this way this time.
- Do you not want me there?

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:08.245
I'm fine with it.

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:10.293
- Okay.
- It'll be nice for him.

01:05:10.375 --> 01:05:11.705
He'll have two Halloweens.

01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:15.995
What am I gonna do with him for second
Halloween? Walk around Sunset Boulevard?

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:17.753
Maybe the hotel has something.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.790
Or you can drive
to a different neighborhood.

01:05:23.541 --> 01:05:26.421
Sun sets forever.

01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:31.543
There shall never be another dawn.

01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:32.455
No!

01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:35.463
Lady...

01:05:36.583 --> 01:05:39.503
I require the solace of the shadows

01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:41.883
and the dark...

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:04.461
Okay, ready for Halloween?

01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:06.916
- Hi.
- Wow, elaborate.

01:06:07.875 --> 01:06:09.955
Don't forget to wear your jacket.
It's getting colder.

01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:11.751
- This is a nice house.
- Ready to go back out?

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:13.333
- He has to pee.
- No, I don't.

01:06:13.416 --> 01:06:14.286
He does.

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:17.125
Some of his men are in here
and also Bear-Bear.

01:06:17.208 --> 01:06:19.038
You can keep that Bear-Bear.
I got another one.

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:20.825
Does he know
that there are two Bear-Bears?

01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:23.416
- It was his idea.
- David Bowie, right? Station to Station?

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:25.081
Let's Dance.

01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:28.495
Henry, have a great Halloween
with Daddy, okay?

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:31.288
Have fun.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.250
Go pee and then we're going back out.

01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:38.421
I'm too tired.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.920
Go pee and then we're gonna go drive
to Halloween.

01:06:41.541 --> 01:06:43.171
This block looks promising.

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.418
I wish Halloween was over.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.040
Well, it isn't.

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:49.625
If we were in New York,
we could be walking.

01:06:49.708 --> 01:06:51.748
But I like how we're sitting right now.

01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:52.883
I like to sit.

01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:56.541
That's true, Los Angeles
does have sitting going for it.

01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:59.543
I think that's why
I like Los Angeles better.

01:06:59.625 --> 01:07:00.705
Because you get to sit?

01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:02.921
And because I like my friends here better.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.250
That's not true.

01:07:04.833 --> 01:07:07.253
What about Horatio and Poppy?

01:07:07.333 --> 01:07:09.383
Horatio doesn't like me anymore.

01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:11.495
And I don't like Poppy.

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:13.043
Here I have Axel.

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.955
Axel's hilarious.
I think you'd like him, Dad.

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:18.251
And my family's here.

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:20.418
Besides you.

01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:49.713
Everyone's asleep.

01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:42.211
I need to pee!

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.251
Who gave you a lighter?

01:08:53.416 --> 01:08:54.286
Lift the seat.

01:09:00.666 --> 01:09:02.746
Gonna have to go back to New York
on Monday.

01:09:03.291 --> 01:09:04.211
Did you flush?

01:09:11.083 --> 01:09:12.043
Wash your hands.

01:09:13.833 --> 01:09:14.963
Will you play with me?

01:09:16.333 --> 01:09:17.793
I'm tired, honey.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.326
Did you hear me?
I have to go back to New York.

01:09:32.416 --> 01:09:34.456
Ah, watch out! I'm falling!

01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:40.041
You didn't catch me.

01:09:42.666 --> 01:09:43.666
Okay?

01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:45.791
Why aren't you here more?

01:09:47.875 --> 01:09:48.955
I have to work.

01:09:49.583 --> 01:09:51.333
You know my play is opening on Broadway.

01:09:52.458 --> 01:09:54.378
Is it because you don't wanna
be around Mom?

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:55.288
No.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.580
You know, like we talked about,

01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:59.206
we both decided not to be together
no matter where we are,

01:09:59.291 --> 01:10:00.881
but we both wanna be with you.

01:10:01.666 --> 01:10:04.036
But you're not near me
if you're in New York.

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:06.383
Well, we also live in New York.

01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:09.043
Yeah, but I go to school here.

01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:10.713
Just for right now.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:13.915
Like that time we were in Copenhagen
for my play.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.790
Remember all those kids in buckets?

01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:20.211
I like my school here, and Mom says
we could stay here if we want.

01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:23.208
What do you mean?

01:10:25.291 --> 01:10:26.291
She said that?

01:10:26.458 --> 01:10:27.288
Yeah.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.130
- Hello?
- Are you moving out here?

01:10:58.666 --> 01:10:59.916
- Did you find a lawyer?
- Yes.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.330
Henry says you're moving here.

01:11:01.416 --> 01:11:02.666
Have your lawyer call Nora.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.080
I wanna talk about it as us.

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:05.206
Who the fuck is us?

01:11:05.291 --> 01:11:07.331
Let's just get in a room, you and me.

01:11:07.416 --> 01:11:08.826
That's what we always said we'd do.

01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:11.376
- My lawyers wouldn't let me sign anything.
- It's not up to them. It's our divorce.

01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:13.668
They say I could later sue them
for malpractice.

01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:16.003
What am I walking into?

01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:17.463
What are you walking into?

01:11:17.541 --> 01:11:19.171
Yes, what the fuck is going on?

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:22.880
I read your fucking emails, Charlie!
I read them all.

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:25.208
- When?
- I don't know, recently.

01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:26.631
- Shit.
- You're a fucking liar.

01:11:26.708 --> 01:11:29.328
- You fucked Mary Ann!
- It was after I was sleeping on the couch.

01:11:29.416 --> 01:11:31.376
It was bullshit about working on us.

01:11:31.458 --> 01:11:33.128
You know what? I have been working.

01:11:33.208 --> 01:11:34.828
I've been doing the work alone.

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:36.246
How did you read my emails?

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.713
I hacked into your account, you dumb fuck!

01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:39.921
I think that's illegal!

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.750
Don't give me this shit
about being surprised about LA.

01:11:42.833 --> 01:11:44.333
Surprise! I have my own opinions.

01:11:44.416 --> 01:11:46.576
How do you even know
how to do something like that?

01:11:46.666 --> 01:11:48.246
I want things that aren't what you want,

01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:50.543
because, surprise,
you were fucking another lady.

01:11:50.625 --> 01:11:53.745
It was one time! I think you're conflating
two different things.

01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:55.503
Mary Ann has nothing to do with LA.

01:11:55.583 --> 01:11:57.133
I am conflating, motherfucker!

01:11:57.208 --> 01:11:58.708
You watch me conflate!

01:12:02.958 --> 01:12:04.878
Did you just stamp your foot?

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:07.748
I don't think I've ever done that before.
I'm just so angry.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:11.500
You look like you needed one.

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:12.793
Yes, I do, thanks.

01:12:13.958 --> 01:12:17.038
You know, the Japanese are making
really interesting tequila right now.

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:18.961
That's exciting, I guess.

01:12:20.333 --> 01:12:21.543
What are you so angry about?

01:12:21.625 --> 01:12:22.995
Fucking ex-husband.

01:12:23.458 --> 01:12:26.828
I spent all this time feeling guilty,
and he's so self-absorbed.

01:12:26.916 --> 01:12:27.786
It's pointless.

01:12:28.333 --> 01:12:30.173
It's a game I'm playing with myself.

01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:34.375
Oh, hey, Pablo. We met at...

01:12:34.458 --> 01:12:36.498
- Oh, you held the bounce board.
- The flirty grip.

01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:42.666
- Here's what I want you to only do, okay?
- What?

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:44.001
I want you to finger me.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.960
- What?
- Just finger me.

01:12:46.416 --> 01:12:48.666
- Okay.
- That's all we'll do, just fingering.

01:12:49.166 --> 01:12:49.996
Okay?

01:12:50.416 --> 01:12:52.126
I'm changing my whole fucking life.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:01.881
Nicole and Charlie's son, Henry,
was born here in Los Angeles.

01:13:01.958 --> 01:13:05.538
He currently attends Laurel Elementary
in Laurel Canyon,

01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:07.075
and Nicole works in Hollywood

01:13:07.166 --> 01:13:10.036
while also maintaining a full schedule
as a mother

01:13:10.125 --> 01:13:12.825
with classes of swim, art,

01:13:12.916 --> 01:13:15.746
gym, and music, as well as play groups.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:19.825
Nicole is Henry's
primary custodial parent,

01:13:19.916 --> 01:13:24.286
and to the extent that Charlie would like
to exercise his custodial time,

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:27.575
he should be making efforts
to visit Henry here in California.

01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:29.536
Nora, you seem to be ignoring the fact

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:32.875
that they lived in New York for ten years.

01:13:32.958 --> 01:13:36.248
My client worked in New York
for several years, that's true.

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:38.633
But Nicole was born and bred
right here in LA.

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:42.500
She and Charlie would come here
most holidays and summers

01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:43.753
to spend time with her family,

01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:45.333
who all live in LA.

01:13:45.916 --> 01:13:47.916
She and Charlie were married in LA.

01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:49.961
Would you like to see the photos?

01:13:50.041 --> 01:13:51.831
No, I don't need to see the photos.

01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:54.251
Although I'm sure
they both look beautiful.

01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:57.918
It's my client's expectation

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.500
that after this TV show is completed,

01:14:00.583 --> 01:14:02.463
the parties will move back to New York

01:14:02.541 --> 01:14:04.421
where they currently keep an apartment.

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:07.670
And it's my understanding
that Charlie promised Nicole

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:09.670
that they would spend more time
in Los Angeles

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:10.920
during the marriage.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.920
But because of his insistence
that his work keep them in New York,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.960
Nicole ended up staying there much longer
than she ever anticipated.

01:14:19.541 --> 01:14:21.461
In fact, a few years ago,

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:24.331
Charlie was offered a residency
at the Geffen Playhouse

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
that would have taken his work
and his family

01:14:28.125 --> 01:14:30.125
to Los Angeles for a year.

01:14:30.916 --> 01:14:32.206
And he...

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:33.665
turned it down.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:36.208
Even though that was Nicole's desire.

01:14:36.291 --> 01:14:40.421
He wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.790
Was this the same consistency
he wanted to maintain

01:14:42.875 --> 01:14:46.285
when they went to Copenhagen
for six months so he could direct a play?

01:14:46.375 --> 01:14:49.415
Now, while I understand that Charlie
lives in New York...

01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:52.326
and when it's convenient
to his work schedule,

01:14:52.416 --> 01:14:54.206
he flies out to see his son...

01:14:54.291 --> 01:14:56.381
He flies out here every chance he gets
at great expense.

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:58.708
I don't see any reason you can't
be out here full-time.

01:14:58.791 --> 01:15:00.131
He makes his living in New York.

01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:02.828
- Sorry, do we want to contemplate lunch?
- Good idea.

01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:04.826
I'll order now so it'll comes
when we're hungry.

01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:05.876
Yeah.

01:15:05.958 --> 01:15:07.078
Everyone good with Manny's?

01:15:07.166 --> 01:15:07.996
I'd love Manny's.

01:15:09.208 --> 01:15:10.498
Have you had Manny's?

01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:12.036
You'll love it.

01:15:12.125 --> 01:15:14.745
Just really yummy sandwiches and salads.

01:15:14.833 --> 01:15:16.423
I'll have the BLT.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.380
Dad?

01:15:18.083 --> 01:15:19.173
Turkey.

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:20.500
I'll have the BLT.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.423
- You'll have the kale?
- Kale salad.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.710
I don't know, sorry.

01:15:43.833 --> 01:15:45.253
Charlie will have...

01:15:47.208 --> 01:15:48.168
the Greek salad,

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:51.670
but with lemon and olive oil
instead of the Greek dressing.

01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:52.790
Okay.

01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:54.875
- I'll have the Chinese chicken salad.
- Okay, sure.

01:15:54.958 --> 01:15:55.998
- Thank you.
- Yep.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.420
Congratulations, Charlie, on your grant.
Nicole told me.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:03.630
Oh, thank you.

01:16:03.708 --> 01:16:05.078
He's a genius.

01:16:06.416 --> 01:16:07.456
Well, I told Nicole,

01:16:07.541 --> 01:16:09.171
I loved your play.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.210
- Oh, thanks.
- Really.

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.213
You are one smart cookie.

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:15.500
Oh, thanks.

01:16:15.583 --> 01:16:17.173
I would just love to...

01:16:17.916 --> 01:16:20.126
crawl inside that brain.

01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:24.833
There was that one moment
when you smell the toast. Smell!

01:16:25.791 --> 01:16:28.711
It was literally my favorite thing
that I saw that year.

01:16:28.791 --> 01:16:31.251
- Thanks.
- Truly genius.

01:16:31.333 --> 01:16:32.173
Thank you.

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:35.380
I was sorry to hear it closed on Broadway.

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:36.958
They couldn't smell the toast.

01:16:38.416 --> 01:16:40.206
It was so emotional.

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.540
It's very competitive, I imagine.

01:16:44.958 --> 01:16:48.578
Now, when Charlie is in Los Angeles,

01:16:48.666 --> 01:16:51.786
Nicole, of course,
agrees that it will be best for Henry

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:54.918
that he see each parent equally.

01:16:57.166 --> 01:17:00.166
It's very nice out here, Charlie.
You should give it a chance.

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:02.710
Yeah, and the space... can't beat it.

01:17:02.791 --> 01:17:04.001
I love it too.

01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:07.996
But all of our personal feelings
about the two cities aside,

01:17:08.083 --> 01:17:12.253
we don't share your assertion
that the couple is an LA-based family.

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:14.793
It was very clearly their deal

01:17:14.875 --> 01:17:18.075
that they would go back to New York
after Nicole finished her show.

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.626
I'm not aware of any deal.

01:17:20.916 --> 01:17:22.496
I didn't get it in writing.

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:28.171
Charlie, is this like the deal
that you made

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:31.580
that you Nicole would spend more time
in LA during your marriage?

01:17:31.666 --> 01:17:34.496
We didn't have a deal.
It was something we discussed.

01:17:34.958 --> 01:17:35.828
But...

01:17:35.916 --> 01:17:38.666
So it's a deal
when it's something you want

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:40.830
and a discussion when Nicole wants it?

01:17:44.166 --> 01:17:45.076
Sidebar...

01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:49.168
Nora, do you have a spare office
where Charlie and I can sidebar?

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:50.420
Sure.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.920
- Can you...
- I can show you.

01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:53.421
Come on.

01:17:59.958 --> 01:18:02.208
- Nora is a very good lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:04.713
- Tough, right?
- Yeah.

01:18:05.375 --> 01:18:08.285
And you're in a bind because you've shown
you're willing to fly out here

01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:10.075
and rent an apartment to see your son.

01:18:10.166 --> 01:18:12.166
- You told me to do that.
- I know that.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:15.250
And I'm doing that because I want
to see my kid, not to set a precedent.

01:18:15.333 --> 01:18:17.833
Yes, but unfortunately,
you are setting a precedent.

01:18:18.666 --> 01:18:20.376
And a judge might look at it that way.

01:18:20.458 --> 01:18:23.668
What's the alternative? I stay in New York
and never come out here?

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:25.710
No, because then it would look
to the court

01:18:25.791 --> 01:18:27.671
like you don't care about seeing your son.

01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:28.880
Court or no court?

01:18:28.958 --> 01:18:30.828
Stop saying "court"
and then "never court."

01:18:30.916 --> 01:18:33.536
Well, the way this is going,
we may have to go to court.

01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:36.293
Are you aware of how maddening you sound?

01:18:36.375 --> 01:18:37.285
I am.

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:40.133
And I know it seems unfair.

01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:45.213
But imagine if you were...

01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:49.125
a poor mother whose husband abandons her

01:18:49.208 --> 01:18:50.918
and then refuses to pay anything.

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:55.380
That's what the system
is trying to protect people from.

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:58.455
Listen...

01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:00.786
if I were representing you...

01:19:00.875 --> 01:19:02.035
You are representing me.

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:03.575
Right, no, of course. No.

01:19:04.375 --> 01:19:08.325
I don't see a judge
moving this child from California.

01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:10.206
I think we try and settle today.

01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:12.580
"Settle" meaning... what?

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.788
- She gets LA.
- No, Bert, just...

01:19:16.916 --> 01:19:17.916
No.

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:19.705
I mean, we have to win this.

01:19:20.166 --> 01:19:22.786
Remember,
the win is what's best for Henry.

01:19:22.875 --> 01:19:25.285
And if you guys go to court,
he's gonna get pulled into it.

01:19:25.375 --> 01:19:28.535
But if he stays here
and I stay in New York, that's just...

01:19:28.875 --> 01:19:29.875
then I won't...

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:32.535
I'll never get
to really be his parent again.

01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:33.455
It'll be different.

01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:34.581
It won't exist.

01:19:35.083 --> 01:19:36.463
So maybe you move here.

01:19:37.166 --> 01:19:38.746
You heard what Amir said
about the space?

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:41.463
Fuck the space, Bert! Fuck the space!

01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:44.921
I'll do whatever you want me to do,
but this is my advice.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.210
I've seen these things go on and on,

01:19:47.375 --> 01:19:50.165
and the burden of these battles
is immeasurable.

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:54.290
I had a client get colon cancer and die
before he and his wife came to agreement.

01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:55.955
What about filing in New York?

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:56.963
It's too late.

01:19:57.333 --> 01:19:59.293
And even if you did,
I don't think it would matter.

01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:01.375
They're being reasonable financially,
you know?

01:20:01.458 --> 01:20:04.038
You're lucky they didn't ask
for half your grant money.

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:06.745
She wouldn't do that. She knows
I put all that money back in my theater.

01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:08.423
If this continues, she might.

01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:11.125
The actors and crew
all rely on that money.

01:20:11.208 --> 01:20:13.248
A court would never agree
with this, right?

01:20:13.333 --> 01:20:16.253
Whether they do or not,
it'll cost you half your grant money

01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:17.673
to go to court and prove it.

01:20:20.625 --> 01:20:21.955
I feel like a criminal.

01:20:22.833 --> 01:20:24.423
But you didn't commit any crime.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:25.830
It doesn't feel that way.

01:20:25.916 --> 01:20:28.286
If we give on LA right now,

01:20:28.375 --> 01:20:30.245
and then try to make
the best deal possible,

01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:32.293
I think we can get her
to give on other fronts.

01:20:32.375 --> 01:20:34.285
There are no other fronts!

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.500
This is the thing!

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:39.206
He needs to know that I fought for him!

01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:40.131
He'll know.

01:20:55.208 --> 01:20:57.378
I should never have let her
come out here with Henry.

01:20:57.583 --> 01:20:59.963
If it wasn't LA or New York,
it'd be something else.

01:21:00.041 --> 01:21:03.501
You'd be fighting about a house
or a school district or...

01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:05.963
You know what this is like?

01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:10.081
This is like that joke about the woman
at the hairdresser, she's going to Rome.

01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:11.576
- You know this?
- I don't.

01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:14.083
This woman is at her hairdresser
and she says,

01:21:14.166 --> 01:21:15.576
"I'm going to Rome on holiday."

01:21:15.666 --> 01:21:18.206
And he says, "Oh, really?
What airline are you taking?"

01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:19.881
She says, "Alitalia."

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:21.878
He says, "Alitalia? Are you crazy?"

01:21:21.958 --> 01:21:24.328
That's the worst...
That's terrible. Don't take that."

01:21:24.416 --> 01:21:25.916
He says, "Where are you gonna stay?"

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.630
She says, "I'm gonna stay at the Hassler."

01:21:27.708 --> 01:21:29.878
"The Hassler? What, are you kidding?"

01:21:29.958 --> 01:21:32.958
They're renovating the Hassler.
You'll hear hammering all night long.

01:21:33.041 --> 01:21:34.921
"You won't sleep. What are you gonna see?"

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.420
She says, "I think I'm gonna try
to go to the Vatican."

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.880
"The Vatican?
You'll be standing in line all day long.

01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:41.078
You'll never see anything..."

01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:43.166
I'm sorry, Bert,
am I paying for this joke?

01:21:45.875 --> 01:21:48.075
Whatever happens here, it's temporary.

01:21:48.958 --> 01:21:51.958
He's growing up.
He's gonna have opinions on the subject.

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:54.245
Time is on your side, Charlie.

01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:58.208
Maybe he'll do college on the East Coast.

01:22:06.833 --> 01:22:11.173
I have most of my coins,
like my quarters and dimes at Daddy's,

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:15.250
but I'm keeping my dollars
and my one twenty at yours, okay?

01:22:15.875 --> 01:22:18.575
So that is one twenty

01:22:18.666 --> 01:22:21.496
plus 50, what is that? Goddamn it.

01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:23.133
What's "Goddamn it"?

01:22:23.208 --> 01:22:25.038
Did you guys lose power where you are?

01:22:25.125 --> 01:22:26.075
Dad?

01:22:26.166 --> 01:22:27.166
Did we lose power?

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:28.580
No.

01:22:29.125 --> 01:22:31.625
There's rolling blackouts
in the hills and now...

01:22:32.583 --> 01:22:35.083
Oh, damn it. Now the gate won't close.

01:22:35.166 --> 01:22:36.626
Her gate won't close.

01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:43.038
Mom!

01:22:47.375 --> 01:22:49.245
- Can we go see my room?
- Yeah, of course.

01:22:49.333 --> 01:22:50.963
- Tried all the...
- I tried everything.

01:22:51.041 --> 01:22:52.791
Sorry I made you come out.

01:22:52.875 --> 01:22:53.785
It's fine.

01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:55.495
- I just...
- You don't want your gate open.

01:22:55.958 --> 01:22:56.788
Right.

01:22:57.291 --> 01:22:58.831
Should be a panel or something
on the side...

01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:00.456
Maybe this is something here.

01:23:02.833 --> 01:23:04.253
- It's a cute house.
- Oh, yeah.

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:06.083
I mean, from what I can see.

01:23:06.166 --> 01:23:06.996
Thanks.

01:23:10.916 --> 01:23:11.996
Getting shaggy.

01:23:12.583 --> 01:23:14.793
Yeah, I have to find a hair cutter.

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:17.380
You want me to cut it?

01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:19.131
Okay.

01:23:30.208 --> 01:23:31.208
Close your eyes.

01:23:36.291 --> 01:23:37.171
He's out.

01:23:37.791 --> 01:23:39.291
Maybe he should stay here tonight.

01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:41.581
It's my night.

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.460
Hey, come on. We're going.
Come on. Let's take a walk. Right?

01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:15.751
Yeah, we're gonna take a walk. Let...
We're taking a walk.

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:18.003
We're mostly finished.

01:24:18.833 --> 01:24:21.503
Bert and I hammered out 90 percent
of the details,

01:24:21.583 --> 01:24:24.583
and there's a couple minor things hanging,

01:24:24.666 --> 01:24:25.916
but it should be easy.

01:24:26.875 --> 01:24:28.995
And then the judge
makes your divorce official.

01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:31.078
Oh. That's good.

01:24:33.916 --> 01:24:35.666
- Fuck me.
- What?

01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:37.833
Who's that?

01:24:38.541 --> 01:24:41.711
- Charlie, you shouldn't have done this.
- What do you mean? Where's Bert?

01:24:42.333 --> 01:24:46.333
This means that everything
we've agreed upon now is off the table.

01:24:46.416 --> 01:24:47.576
We've got LA, right?

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:49.626
Not with Jay Marotta representing him.

01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:51.666
This is a street fight now.

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:55.290
And I'm gonna have to ask for things
that we wouldn't normally ask for.

01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:58.330
This system rewards bad behavior.

01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:01.173
- Jay.
- Hey.

01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:02.170
Hi.

01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:04.540
I saw Miriam at Madeo the other night.

01:25:04.625 --> 01:25:06.625
- Yeah?
- Looking very handsome.

01:25:06.708 --> 01:25:09.248
You know, you should come
to our Stand Up To Cancer event.

01:25:09.333 --> 01:25:11.583
- John Legend's gonna play.
- Oh, I love him.

01:25:11.666 --> 01:25:13.536
Okay. It's gonna be
at the Beverly Hilton, I think.

01:25:13.625 --> 01:25:14.455
- Great.
- Okay?

01:25:14.541 --> 01:25:17.001
- She said you're spending time in Malibu.
- Oh, really?

01:25:17.083 --> 01:25:20.213
Me too. Haven't seen her
since that building was ICM.

01:25:21.041 --> 01:25:22.381
A little history.

01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:26.133
Ten years ago, Charlie takes a risk

01:25:26.208 --> 01:25:28.788
when he first hires Nicole as an actress

01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:30.745
in his play in New York City.

01:25:31.458 --> 01:25:34.168
He's a well-regarded
up-and-coming director

01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:35.460
of the avant-garde.

01:25:35.958 --> 01:25:37.168
And she's known

01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:41.210
as the girl in that college sex movie
who takes her top off.

01:25:41.416 --> 01:25:43.456
- My client will not be slut-shamed...
- Ten years on...

01:25:43.541 --> 01:25:45.631
- for an artistic choice.
- and many prestigious

01:25:45.708 --> 01:25:47.128
theater roles later...

01:25:47.583 --> 01:25:50.673
She becomes an actress
of great credibility.

01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:52.790
And it's because of that credibility,

01:25:52.875 --> 01:25:56.625
that she's offered the lead role
in a major television show.

01:25:56.708 --> 01:26:00.128
This new opportunity is thanks to Charlie.

01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:04.078
Your Honor, we shouldn't have
to pay support money at this point.

01:26:04.583 --> 01:26:08.793
In fact, Charlie is entitled
to half her TV money,

01:26:09.416 --> 01:26:11.876
present and future earnings of the show.

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.540
Charlie's just received
the enormous sum of $650,000

01:26:18.625 --> 01:26:20.165
in the form of a MacArthur grant.

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:22.170
- Of which he gets...
- This is for the theater work...

01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:25.000
- in $125,000 installments...
- he conducted during the marriage.

01:26:25.083 --> 01:26:26.253
Over five years.

01:26:26.333 --> 01:26:28.173
- So by Jay's same logic...
- He uses the money...

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:31.040
- that Nicole contributed to.
- to employ actors and crew members...

01:26:31.125 --> 01:26:34.035
- One at a time, please.
- and to pay debts that he's accumulated

01:26:34.125 --> 01:26:36.875
with his theater company
that stars his wife.

01:26:39.708 --> 01:26:42.078
- Bless you.
- Not only did she turn down a lucrative

01:26:42.166 --> 01:26:44.206
and successful career in movies

01:26:44.291 --> 01:26:46.501
to perform in his little theater,

01:26:47.083 --> 01:26:49.293
but she actually supplied Charlie

01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:51.075
with a loan early on to help out.

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:53.666
- Which he paid back.
- She lent her name to the marquee,

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:56.000
which was the principle reason
people came to the theater.

01:26:56.083 --> 01:26:57.793
That may have been true ten years ago.

01:26:58.458 --> 01:27:01.958
And in turn, she helped establish
Charlie's reputation.

01:27:02.583 --> 01:27:04.083
Now, over the next ten years,

01:27:04.166 --> 01:27:07.246
she was subsequently offered parts
in movies, TV shows,

01:27:07.333 --> 01:27:09.833
most of which she turned down
at Charlie's behest

01:27:09.916 --> 01:27:12.456
to be a mom and act in his plays.

01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:17.081
So while we are willing
to be flexible on support,

01:27:17.166 --> 01:27:20.826
we contend that half of Charlie's
grant money be split between the parties.

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:23.456
I don't see how you can claim
that she gets half a grant

01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:25.421
dedicated to his genius.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.000
He became a genius
during the course of the marriage.

01:27:27.083 --> 01:27:28.173
Oh, come on, Nora.

01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:31.000
Charlie himself, upon hearing
that he received the prize,

01:27:31.083 --> 01:27:33.213
told Nicole that it belonged to her too.

01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:35.706
That's what people say
when they win awards.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.750
No, he was implying what was true.

01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:42.918
His genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.170
Nora, I like how you refer
to Charlie's theater

01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:48.830
as a ramshackle downtown dump

01:27:48.916 --> 01:27:50.416
when you're arguing custody,

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.580
but when you want more money,

01:27:52.666 --> 01:27:55.246
he's a big, rich, genius
Broadway director.

01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:56.463
You can't have it both ways.

01:27:56.541 --> 01:27:57.881
Oh, really? Why not?

01:27:58.083 --> 01:28:00.333
And whether you think
it's fair or not, Jay,

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.580
the first monetary installment
from the MacArthur grant

01:28:03.666 --> 01:28:06.206
was put into a joint
marital accountant, and thus...

01:28:06.291 --> 01:28:09.081
Fuck. You shouldn't have put
that money in a joint account.

01:28:09.166 --> 01:28:12.126
There's not gonna be anything left,
anyway. I'm using it all to divorce her.

01:28:12.208 --> 01:28:14.788
Nora, I have to say
that your account of this marriage

01:28:14.875 --> 01:28:17.325
takes place in an alternate reality.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.170
By suddenly moving to LA

01:28:20.583 --> 01:28:23.503
and insisting on an LA residence,

01:28:23.583 --> 01:28:25.713
Nicole is withholding Henry...

01:28:25.791 --> 01:28:28.501
- Counsel, please be seated.
- alienating him from his father,

01:28:28.583 --> 01:28:31.463
which has turned Charlie's world
upside down.

01:28:31.541 --> 01:28:33.001
- Counselor?
- It amounts to an ambush.

01:28:33.083 --> 01:28:35.503
"Witholding," Jay? Really? "Alienating"?

01:28:35.583 --> 01:28:37.383
Well, those are fighting words,

01:28:37.458 --> 01:28:40.328
and it's simply false and does nothing
to further this settlement.

01:28:41.875 --> 01:28:44.375
Your recap of the situation is outrageous.

01:28:44.458 --> 01:28:47.538
And although California is,
without doubt, a no-fault state,

01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:50.825
it bears mentioning
in the accurate recap of the situation

01:28:50.916 --> 01:28:52.706
that Charlie had had extramarital affairs.

01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:55.461
- An extramarital affair.
- Do you really want me to go there?

01:28:55.541 --> 01:28:57.461
- Yeah, let's go there.
- Okay.

01:28:57.541 --> 01:29:00.751
Nicole has admitted
to hacking Charlie's computer

01:29:00.833 --> 01:29:02.133
and reading his emails,

01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:04.578
which, if proven, is a felony.

01:29:04.958 --> 01:29:06.788
And, Nora,
I don't think you'll be too happy

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:10.205
if I ask Nicole about her alcohol
consumption in the evenings.

01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:11.131
What?

01:29:11.208 --> 01:29:16.128
She confided in Charlie recently,
having just carried Henry to bed,

01:29:16.208 --> 01:29:20.578
that she was having trouble standing
while walking down the staircase.

01:29:21.291 --> 01:29:24.251
And from what I understand,
this is not an isolated event.

01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:26.633
So you let me know, Nora,

01:29:26.708 --> 01:29:28.918
- and will go there as needed.
- Charlie?

01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:31.128
Can I ask you,

01:29:31.208 --> 01:29:33.128
how do you expect
to have more time with Henry

01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:35.578
when you don't exercise the time
you already have?

01:29:35.666 --> 01:29:37.876
And exercise it responsibly?

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.290
On a recent visit to Los Angeles,

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:43.995
after failing to call, text,

01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:46.503
communicate in any way, shape, or form,

01:29:46.583 --> 01:29:48.963
Charlie finally arrived two hours late
to pick up Henry

01:29:49.041 --> 01:29:50.131
at Nicole's mother's house.

01:29:50.208 --> 01:29:52.078
At that point, the car seat,

01:29:52.166 --> 01:29:55.916
which he had assured Nicole
had been professionally installed,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.460
was clearly not even belted in.

01:29:57.541 --> 01:30:00.291
- It was sitting in the back seat.
- You have to buckle in the car seat.

01:30:00.375 --> 01:30:01.375
- It's the law.
- I know that.

01:30:01.458 --> 01:30:03.628
- I thought the rental place did it.
- No, they can't do it. It's a liability.

01:30:03.708 --> 01:30:05.958
I know that now.
Once we discovered that, we fixed it.

01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:06.961
Counsel?

01:30:07.958 --> 01:30:09.578
You can see my courtroom is full

01:30:09.666 --> 01:30:13.206
and there are people who don't have
the resources your clients have,

01:30:13.583 --> 01:30:16.793
and I'm fairly certain
you haven't exhausted, in good faith,

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:19.205
the arguments in the case of this child.

01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:21.791
In the meantime,
we'll keep the status quo.

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:25.325
This remains an LA family
for the time being.

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:28.000
I took over this department recently,

01:30:28.583 --> 01:30:31.333
and I'm still becoming acquainted
with the cases.

01:30:31.416 --> 01:30:35.286
So I'm going to appoint
an expert evaluator

01:30:35.791 --> 01:30:38.711
who knows much more
about young children than I do.

01:30:39.375 --> 01:30:41.745
Once the evaluation is done,

01:30:41.833 --> 01:30:44.463
we'll modify the orders where necessary.

01:30:49.666 --> 01:30:50.576
Hey.

01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:52.380
Hey, where's Henry?

01:30:52.958 --> 01:30:55.128
He's with Cassie and her kids
at laser tag.

01:30:56.375 --> 01:30:57.325
You want something to drink?

01:30:57.416 --> 01:31:01.076
I have unfiltered tap water,
beer, and some juice boxes.

01:31:01.541 --> 01:31:02.541
I'll take a juice box.

01:31:08.708 --> 01:31:10.288
You don't have anything on the walls?

01:31:10.791 --> 01:31:12.671
I don't have anything
except Henry's art,

01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:13.920
which is being framed.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.670
I can give you some stuff,

01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:17.630
you know, till you get some things.

01:31:18.291 --> 01:31:21.211
How about that great picture
of Henry on the Staten Island ferry?

01:31:21.666 --> 01:31:22.626
Aren't you in that one?

01:31:24.375 --> 01:31:25.995
I guess I... I guess you can cut me out.

01:31:26.083 --> 01:31:28.463
I'm gonna have to leave a day early
to go to New York on the 22nd.

01:31:28.541 --> 01:31:30.711
So I was wondering
if I could take Henry that Friday.

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:33.750
The 22nd, so that's the 21st?

01:31:35.083 --> 01:31:36.503
We have plans, actually.

01:31:36.583 --> 01:31:39.463
We're going to something at LACMA
with the cousins.

01:31:40.125 --> 01:31:41.915
But could you change it
so I could take him?

01:31:43.166 --> 01:31:44.576
It's just one night.
He's looking forward to it.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:48.036
- Really?
- It's my night, Charlie, we negotiated it.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:49.535
Okay, fine.

01:31:50.833 --> 01:31:51.793
But what?

01:31:51.875 --> 01:31:53.785
No, I'm just asking you to be flexible.

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:56.705
I am flexible. You come in and out
and I adjust based on your schedule.

01:31:56.791 --> 01:31:59.751
- This one night we have tickets to...
- It's not only this one night, but fine.

01:32:00.125 --> 01:32:01.825
Henry's teacher wants to meet with us.

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:03.376
You mean his LA teacher?

01:32:03.541 --> 01:32:06.381
Can you answer the email
so we could set a time?

01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:08.250
Yeah, I've been distracted.

01:32:09.333 --> 01:32:10.333
I understand.

01:32:10.875 --> 01:32:13.415
They just wanna rule out everything,
you know, with his reading.

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.630
I just think he's a little over-anxious.
I think he wants it too much.

01:32:17.166 --> 01:32:19.166
They said he's off the charts in math.

01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:21.420
He quits too easily
when things aren't easy for him.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.170
You know, he's like us, he's stubborn.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.250
He's still a lousy Monopoly player
'cause he tries to save all his money.

01:32:32.875 --> 01:32:33.745
So...

01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:36.333
I thought we should talk.

01:32:37.583 --> 01:32:39.543
I feel like maybe things
have gone too far.

01:32:40.458 --> 01:32:43.878
I mean, my mom's taking out a loan
against the house to help me pay Nora.

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:45.208
I thought I paid Nora.

01:32:45.291 --> 01:32:47.001
You pay 30 percent of Nora.

01:32:47.125 --> 01:32:49.625
Well, I'm going broke too,
if that's any help.

01:32:49.791 --> 01:32:51.791
I've just agreed
to direct two shitty plays,

01:32:51.875 --> 01:32:54.165
and we can forget putting anything away
for Henry's college.

01:32:54.666 --> 01:32:58.126
It's just that up until now, we've been
able to keep Henry somewhat removed,

01:32:58.208 --> 01:32:59.418
and this will change that.

01:33:00.958 --> 01:33:01.918
We have to protect him.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:02.920
I agree.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.290
Nora says that the evaluator
will come into our homes,

01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:08.995
they're gonna interview Henry
in addition to us,

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:12.133
our friends, family, enemies,

01:33:12.208 --> 01:33:15.498
and then they'll observe us with him,
how we are as parents.

01:33:15.583 --> 01:33:17.173
- Sounds awful.
- I know.

01:33:17.666 --> 01:33:21.076
I feel like if anybody observed me on any
given day as a mom, I'd never get custody.

01:33:23.541 --> 01:33:24.461
That was a joke.

01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:27.285
- I know. I feel the same way.
- Right.

01:33:27.375 --> 01:33:28.285
So...

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:31.880
Maybe we can figure
something out between us.

01:33:32.375 --> 01:33:34.535
You remember I said this to you
at the beginning?

01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.825
I know you did,
but these are different circumstances.

01:33:36.916 --> 01:33:38.746
I was anticipating these circumstances.

01:33:39.625 --> 01:33:41.535
Anyway, shall we try this?

01:33:41.625 --> 01:33:42.455
Okay.

01:33:57.125 --> 01:33:58.125
I don't know how to start.

01:34:00.666 --> 01:34:03.126
Do you understand why I wanna stay in LA?

01:34:03.208 --> 01:34:04.038
No.

01:34:04.166 --> 01:34:05.496
Well... that's not...

01:34:05.583 --> 01:34:08.133
Charlie, that's not a useful way
for us to start.

01:34:08.208 --> 01:34:09.288
I don't understand it.

01:34:11.208 --> 01:34:13.998
You don't remember promising
that we could do time here?

01:34:14.083 --> 01:34:15.133
We discussed things.

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.040
We were married, we said things.

01:34:17.125 --> 01:34:18.745
We talked about moving to Europe.

01:34:18.833 --> 01:34:20.043
About getting a...

01:34:21.166 --> 01:34:23.326
sideboard or what do you call it?

01:34:23.416 --> 01:34:25.956
A credenza, to fill the empty space
behind the couch.

01:34:26.041 --> 01:34:27.171
We never did any of it.

01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:29.040
You turned down
the residency at the Geffen

01:34:29.125 --> 01:34:31.205
that would've brought us here for a year.

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:32.631
It wasn't something I wanted.

01:34:32.708 --> 01:34:35.458
We had a great theater company
and a great life where we were.

01:34:35.541 --> 01:34:37.001
You call that a great life?

01:34:37.083 --> 01:34:38.083
You know what I mean.

01:34:38.166 --> 01:34:40.876
I don't mean we had a great marriage.
I mean life in Brooklyn.

01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:42.670
Professionally.

01:34:43.083 --> 01:34:45.793
I don't know. Honestly,
I never considered anything different.

01:34:45.875 --> 01:34:47.535
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:50.575
I mean, I was your wife.
You should've considered my happiness too.

01:34:50.666 --> 01:34:54.326
Come on, you were happy.
You've just decided you weren't now.

01:34:55.708 --> 01:34:56.708
Okay.

01:34:58.041 --> 01:34:59.001
Let's...

01:34:59.666 --> 01:35:02.496
My work is here now, my family is here.

01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:05.463
And I agreed to put Henry in school here
because your show went to series.

01:35:05.541 --> 01:35:08.751
I did that knowing that when you were done
shooting, he would come back to New York.

01:35:08.833 --> 01:35:09.673
Honey, we never said that.

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:12.080
That may have been your assumption,
but we never said that.

01:35:12.166 --> 01:35:13.206
We did say it.

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:14.881
When did we say it?

01:35:14.958 --> 01:35:17.288
I don't know when we said it,
but we said it.

01:35:17.375 --> 01:35:20.245
- We said it that time on the phone!
- Honey, let me finish. Sorry.

01:35:20.333 --> 01:35:21.633
I keeps saying that.

01:35:21.708 --> 01:35:24.668
I thought that if Henry was happy here,

01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:27.500
and my show continued,
that we might do LA for a while.

01:35:27.583 --> 01:35:29.793
I was not privy to that thought process.

01:35:30.333 --> 01:35:33.293
The only reason we didn't live here
is because you can't imagine desires

01:35:33.375 --> 01:35:35.825
other than your own,
unless they're forced on you.

01:35:35.916 --> 01:35:38.876
Okay, you wish you hadn't married me,
you wish you'd had a different life,

01:35:38.958 --> 01:35:40.208
but this is what happened.

01:35:41.416 --> 01:35:42.876
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

01:35:45.083 --> 01:35:46.963
Nora says
there's no coming back from this.

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:47.921
Fuck Nora!

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.580
I hate fucking Nora telling me
I always lived in LA

01:35:50.666 --> 01:35:52.416
even though I never lived in LA.

01:35:53.333 --> 01:35:55.253
How could you have her
say those things about me?

01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:57.003
Jay said them about me too.

01:35:57.666 --> 01:35:59.036
You shouldn't have fired Bert.

01:35:59.125 --> 01:36:00.375
I needed my own asshole.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.040
Let's just both agree both of our lawyers
said shitty stuff about both of us.

01:36:06.125 --> 01:36:07.125
Nora was worse.

01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:08.915
Jay called me an alcoholic.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.630
You pulled the rug out from under me
and you're putting me through hell.

01:36:11.708 --> 01:36:13.418
You put me through hell
during our marriage.

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:14.750
Oh, is that what that was, hell?

01:36:14.833 --> 01:36:16.713
Now you'll put Henry
through this horrible thing

01:36:16.791 --> 01:36:18.381
so you can yet again get what you want!

01:36:18.458 --> 01:36:21.828
It's not what I want. I mean,
it's what I want, but it's what was...

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.670
was...

01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:24.880
what's best for him.

01:36:24.958 --> 01:36:27.168
Oh, well, I was wondering when you'd
get around to Henry

01:36:27.250 --> 01:36:28.500
and what he actually wants.

01:36:28.583 --> 01:36:29.543
Fuck off!

01:36:29.625 --> 01:36:30.955
No, you fuck off!

01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:33.001
If you'd listen to your son, or anyone,

01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:34.753
then he'd tell you
that he'd rather live here!

01:36:34.833 --> 01:36:36.633
Stop putting your feelings about me
onto Henry.

01:36:36.708 --> 01:36:38.248
He tells me he likes it better here.

01:36:38.333 --> 01:36:40.423
He tells you because he knows
it's what you wanna hear!

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:43.250
He tells me you're on the phone all
the time. You don't even play with him.

01:36:43.333 --> 01:36:46.463
Because I'm going through a divorce in LA
and trying to direct a play in New York!

01:36:46.541 --> 01:36:49.791
Which closed because I wasn't there.
It was a huge opportunity...

01:36:49.875 --> 01:36:51.535
Fighting for something
you don't even want!

01:36:53.083 --> 01:36:54.713
You're being so much like your father.

01:36:55.708 --> 01:36:57.038
Do not compare me to my father!

01:36:57.125 --> 01:36:59.535
I didn't compare you to him.
I said you were acting like him.

01:36:59.625 --> 01:37:00.875
You're exactly like your mother.

01:37:00.958 --> 01:37:02.628
Everything you were complaining about her,
you're doing.

01:37:02.708 --> 01:37:04.078
You're suffocating Henry.

01:37:04.166 --> 01:37:06.376
First of all, I love my mother.
She was wonderful mother.

01:37:06.458 --> 01:37:07.708
I'm just repeating what you told me.

01:37:07.791 --> 01:37:11.251
Secondly, how dare you
compare my mothering to my mother!

01:37:11.333 --> 01:37:14.253
I may be like my father,
but I am not like my mother!

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:17.043
You are! And you're like my father!

01:37:17.125 --> 01:37:18.535
You're also like my mother!

01:37:18.625 --> 01:37:20.745
You're all the bad things
about all of these people!

01:37:21.208 --> 01:37:22.458
But mostly your mother.

01:37:22.541 --> 01:37:24.881
When we'd lie in bed together,
sometimes I would look at you

01:37:24.958 --> 01:37:26.668
and see her and just feel so gross!

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:29.460
- I felt repulsed when you touched me!
- You're a slob.

01:37:29.541 --> 01:37:32.381
- I made the beds, closed cabinets...
- The thought of having sex with you...

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:34.540
makes me wanna peel my skin off.

01:37:34.625 --> 01:37:36.995
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

01:37:37.083 --> 01:37:39.633
You'll think you found
some better opposite guy than me,

01:37:39.708 --> 01:37:42.078
and in a few years,
you'll rebel against him

01:37:42.166 --> 01:37:45.206
because you need to have your voice,
but you don't want a voice.

01:37:45.291 --> 01:37:47.581
You just wanna fucking complain
about not having a voice!

01:37:47.666 --> 01:37:50.916
I think about being married to you,
and that woman is a stranger to me.

01:37:51.458 --> 01:37:53.918
- I mean, we had a child's marriage.
- You've regressed.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.630
You've gone back to your life
before you met me, it's pathetic.

01:37:56.708 --> 01:38:00.668
People used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist.

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:02.380
And I used to defend you.

01:38:02.458 --> 01:38:03.828
They were absolutely right.

01:38:03.916 --> 01:38:06.626
All your best acting is behind you.
You're back to being a hack!

01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:09.878
You gaslighted me!
You're a fucking villain!

01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:13.418
You want to present yourself as a victim
because it's a good legal strategy?

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.130
Fine, but you and I both know

01:38:15.208 --> 01:38:16.578
you chose this life!

01:38:17.208 --> 01:38:19.128
You wanted it until you didn't!

01:38:20.166 --> 01:38:22.286
You used me so you could get out of LA.

01:38:22.375 --> 01:38:23.415
I didn't use you.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.790
You did and then you blamed me for it!

01:38:26.083 --> 01:38:28.423
You always made me aware
of what I was doing wrong,

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:29.790
how I was falling short!

01:38:29.875 --> 01:38:31.575
Life with you was joyless!

01:38:31.666 --> 01:38:34.206
What, so then you had to go
and fuck someone else?

01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:35.881
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

01:38:35.958 --> 01:38:37.828
You should be upset
that I had a laugh with her!

01:38:37.916 --> 01:38:38.746
Do you love her?

01:38:38.833 --> 01:38:40.173
No.

01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:41.460
But she didn't hate me.

01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:42.631
You hated me.

01:38:42.708 --> 01:38:43.918
You hated me.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.630
You fucked somebody we worked with.

01:38:45.708 --> 01:38:48.168
You stopped having sex with me
in the last year.

01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:49.750
I never cheated on you.

01:38:49.833 --> 01:38:50.923
That was cheating on me!

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.040
But there was so much I could have done.

01:38:53.125 --> 01:38:55.825
I was a director in my 20s
who came from nothing

01:38:55.916 --> 01:38:58.996
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking Time Out New York!

01:38:59.083 --> 01:39:01.963
I was hot shit and I wanted
to fuck everybody and I didn't.

01:39:02.041 --> 01:39:04.381
And I loved you
and I didn't wanna lose you.

01:39:04.458 --> 01:39:07.288
But I'm in my 20s
and I didn't wanna lose that too,

01:39:07.375 --> 01:39:08.825
and I kinda did!

01:39:09.208 --> 01:39:11.748
And you wanted so much so fast.

01:39:11.833 --> 01:39:13.543
I didn't even wanna get married.

01:39:13.625 --> 01:39:15.075
I mean, fuck it!

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.290
There's so much I didn't do.

01:39:18.041 --> 01:39:19.921
- Thanks for that!
- You're welcome!

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.250
I can't believe
I have to know you forever!

01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:25.333
Oh, you're fucking insane!

01:39:26.083 --> 01:39:28.333
And you're fucking winning!

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.540
Are you kidding me?

01:39:31.208 --> 01:39:32.748
I wanted to be married.

01:39:33.375 --> 01:39:34.625
I'd already lost!

01:39:35.125 --> 01:39:37.415
You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

01:39:39.416 --> 01:39:40.956
What does that have to do with LA?

01:39:43.291 --> 01:39:44.131
What?

01:39:44.208 --> 01:39:47.708
You're so merged
with your own selfishness,

01:39:47.791 --> 01:39:50.921
you don't even identify it
as selfishness anymore!

01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:53.460
You're such a dick!

01:39:53.541 --> 01:39:56.331
Every day I wake up
and I hope you're dead!

01:39:56.416 --> 01:39:59.376
Dead like... if I could guarantee
Henry would be okay,

01:39:59.458 --> 01:40:00.998
I'd hope you'd get an illness

01:40:01.083 --> 01:40:03.213
and then get hit by a car and die!

01:40:23.333 --> 01:40:25.043
Oh, God!

01:40:34.833 --> 01:40:35.793
I'm sorry.

01:40:37.708 --> 01:40:38.668
Me too.

01:41:05.083 --> 01:41:06.883
Okay, no, we can make this nice.

01:41:08.041 --> 01:41:10.751
I would take the smaller plants
and put them by the window.

01:41:11.375 --> 01:41:13.325
And do you have things
we can put on the walls?

01:41:33.916 --> 01:41:35.746
All right, that's it. Thank you very much.

01:41:35.833 --> 01:41:39.423
We miss you and it looks great, really.
Let us know how it goes, okay?

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:41.920
All right. I'll see you guys on Monday.

01:41:42.333 --> 01:41:44.423
- Love you.
- All right, love you too. Bye.

01:42:09.458 --> 01:42:11.708
Why do we have so many plants
all of a sudden?

01:42:11.791 --> 01:42:14.001
We'll have to return some of that stuff,
so don't get used to it.

01:42:14.083 --> 01:42:16.293
I find plants kind of scary.

01:42:16.375 --> 01:42:17.495
These plants are good guys.

01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:20.330
Hey, come here.

01:42:22.916 --> 01:42:23.786
Yeah?

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.290
Tomorrow, this woman is going to come

01:42:27.375 --> 01:42:28.705
and visit us...

01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:31.960
and be with us while we eat dinner.

01:42:32.375 --> 01:42:34.625
- Is it your girlfriend?
- No.

01:42:34.708 --> 01:42:37.418
- Is it Mommy's boyfriend?
- No. Why? Does Mommy have a boyfriend?

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.580
I don't know. Does she?

01:42:39.666 --> 01:42:40.626
I don't know.

01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:42.080
I don't know.

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.130
Why is someone watching us eat dinner?

01:42:45.208 --> 01:42:46.578
I know, it's weird.

01:42:47.375 --> 01:42:48.955
It's just something we have to do.

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.000
Which has to do with...

01:42:51.583 --> 01:42:53.753
Mommy and me figuring out everything...

01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:55.960
and how we're gonna be.

01:42:58.791 --> 01:42:59.631
You know?

01:43:00.916 --> 01:43:02.126
Will you read to me?

01:43:03.291 --> 01:43:04.501
Sure. Grab your book.

01:43:05.625 --> 01:43:07.075
Do you use drugs or alcohol?

01:43:07.875 --> 01:43:08.875
I drink alcohol.

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.920
How much alcohol do you drink?

01:43:13.833 --> 01:43:15.793
I don't know, glass of wine with dinner.

01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:17.210
Sometimes more.

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:18.251
How much more?

01:43:20.083 --> 01:43:21.793
It's... Sometimes a...

01:43:22.458 --> 01:43:23.288
few...

01:43:23.958 --> 01:43:27.378
I... sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone.

01:43:27.458 --> 01:43:29.328
- Okay, who do you split it with?
- I mean...

01:43:29.416 --> 01:43:33.076
if I'm having dinner with someone
and we order a bottle of wine.

01:43:33.166 --> 01:43:34.996
- Okay.
- You know, like at a restaurant.

01:43:35.416 --> 01:43:39.246
When you say, "Do you wanna go
by the glass or do we get a bottle?"

01:43:40.166 --> 01:43:41.126
You get a bottle?

01:43:41.708 --> 01:43:42.918
Well, sometimes.

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:46.540
But... I mean,
sometimes I go by the glass.

01:43:47.250 --> 01:43:48.420
You know, it depends.

01:43:52.916 --> 01:43:55.996
Did you mean drugs ever?
I have done drugs.

01:43:57.458 --> 01:43:58.458
In college.

01:43:59.625 --> 01:44:01.825
- Anything since you've been...
- I don't do it regularly.

01:44:02.291 --> 01:44:03.791
Anything since you've been a mother?

01:44:06.375 --> 01:44:07.665
Pot a few times.

01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:11.670
Coke once at a party.
Henry wasn't with me.

01:44:14.208 --> 01:44:17.168
What would you say
are your strengths as a parent?

01:44:25.333 --> 01:44:26.293
I listen.

01:44:27.708 --> 01:44:28.578
I play.

01:44:31.041 --> 01:44:33.581
I put in the time. I...

01:44:34.291 --> 01:44:35.131
love...

01:44:36.166 --> 01:44:37.746
taking care of him...

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.040
watching him grow.

01:44:42.166 --> 01:44:43.206
And sometimes...

01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:47.461
what they say about "it goes so fast"
is true, but...

01:44:49.041 --> 01:44:50.131
sometimes it's not.

01:44:50.541 --> 01:44:53.211
Sometimes it goes too slow, honestly.

01:44:54.541 --> 01:44:55.921
What are your weaknesses?

01:44:59.083 --> 01:45:00.583
I'm too precise.

01:45:00.666 --> 01:45:01.746
I care too much.

01:45:02.583 --> 01:45:03.753
Are those weaknesses?

01:45:06.458 --> 01:45:07.418
Maybe not.

01:45:10.583 --> 01:45:13.133
You know, he can be an asshole and...

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:16.671
I can get really pissed off
and I'll call him on being an asshole...

01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:18.000
I'm gonna stop you there.

01:45:18.458 --> 01:45:20.578
When you do this for real,
don't ever say that.

01:45:20.666 --> 01:45:22.826
People don't accept mothers
who drink too much wine

01:45:22.916 --> 01:45:24.996
and yell at their child
and call him an asshole.

01:45:25.083 --> 01:45:26.503
I get it. I do it too.

01:45:27.208 --> 01:45:29.328
We can accept an imperfect dad.

01:45:29.416 --> 01:45:33.666
Let's face it, the idea of a good father
was only invented like 30 years ago.

01:45:34.333 --> 01:45:37.213
Before that,
fathers were expected to be silent

01:45:37.291 --> 01:45:41.211
and absent and unreliable and selfish,

01:45:41.291 --> 01:45:43.381
and can all say
we want them to be different.

01:45:44.125 --> 01:45:47.125
But on some basic level, we accept them.

01:45:47.208 --> 01:45:49.208
We love them for their fallibilities,

01:45:49.291 --> 01:45:53.171
but people absolutely don't accept
those same failings in mothers.

01:45:53.250 --> 01:45:56.290
We don't accept it structurally
and we don't accept it spiritually.

01:45:56.375 --> 01:45:59.995
Because the basis
of our Judeo-Christian whatever

01:46:00.083 --> 01:46:02.173
is Mary, Mother of Jesus,

01:46:02.250 --> 01:46:03.750
and she's perfect.

01:46:03.833 --> 01:46:06.383
She's a virgin who gives birth,

01:46:06.916 --> 01:46:09.166
unwaveringly supports her child

01:46:09.250 --> 01:46:11.460
and holds his dead body when he's gone.

01:46:12.041 --> 01:46:15.081
And the dad isn't there.
He didn't even do the fucking.

01:46:15.166 --> 01:46:16.206
God is in Heaven.

01:46:17.375 --> 01:46:19.285
God is the father

01:46:19.375 --> 01:46:21.245
and God didn't show up.

01:46:21.583 --> 01:46:25.583
So you have to be perfect and Charlie
can be a fuck up and it doesn't matter.

01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:29.960
You will always be held
to a different higher standard.

01:46:30.375 --> 01:46:33.495
And it's fucked up,
but that is the way it is.

01:47:01.083 --> 01:47:04.083
I think I rang the wrong bell. Nancy Katz.

01:47:04.166 --> 01:47:05.326
Hi. I'm Charlie Barber.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.540
Henry's just playing in his room.

01:47:09.208 --> 01:47:10.378
Nancy, can I get you anything?

01:47:11.166 --> 01:47:13.626
I'm easy. A glass of water?

01:47:22.875 --> 01:47:24.075
It's a new apartment.

01:47:31.041 --> 01:47:32.331
Shall we go in here?

01:47:32.416 --> 01:47:33.246
Sure.

01:47:50.458 --> 01:47:53.328
What's a day like for the two of you here?

01:47:53.958 --> 01:47:56.378
Well, if he has school,
I take him there, of course,

01:47:56.458 --> 01:47:58.328
and pick him up, assuming I can do both.

01:47:58.666 --> 01:48:00.626
What prevents you from picking him up?

01:48:02.458 --> 01:48:03.628
You know, work.

01:48:03.708 --> 01:48:05.668
I'm preparing a play
I'm directing in a few months.

01:48:06.125 --> 01:48:07.495
Oh, what is that?

01:48:07.708 --> 01:48:10.628
Kasimir and Karoline by Ödön von Horváth.

01:48:10.708 --> 01:48:12.538
We're doing it at the Barrow in New York.

01:48:12.625 --> 01:48:14.125
So you have to be away?

01:48:14.208 --> 01:48:17.418
Yes, recently, since Nicole's
been working on the show in LA,

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:18.920
I come back and forth a lot.

01:48:19.375 --> 01:48:21.035
- That sounds difficult.
- It is.

01:48:22.083 --> 01:48:23.083
And expensive.

01:48:23.166 --> 01:48:24.996
I'll try to take him
with me some of the time,

01:48:25.083 --> 01:48:27.043
but Nicole doesn't like for him
to fly so much.

01:48:27.125 --> 01:48:30.455
Well, that can be hard on the child,
all that recycled air.

01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:33.920
Well, he's sturdy.

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:38.710
Some parents won't take their kids to
a restaurant because of these superbugs.

01:48:42.916 --> 01:48:45.326
I noticed on one visit to Los Angeles,

01:48:45.416 --> 01:48:46.496
you came on a Sunday

01:48:46.583 --> 01:48:48.043
and left on a Thursday.

01:48:48.125 --> 01:48:49.875
Why not stay for a weekend?

01:48:50.375 --> 01:48:51.325
Oh...

01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:55.380
that time I had tech
for Electra in New York.

01:48:55.833 --> 01:48:56.963
What's that?

01:48:57.875 --> 01:48:59.915
It was my Broadway debut.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.040
Oh, I don't know what "tech" is.

01:49:02.125 --> 01:49:05.575
It's the technical part of the production.
You figure out the lights.

01:49:05.666 --> 01:49:07.876
- And Monday's our day off in the theater.
- What's a weekend day like?

01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:10.628
Well, out here, he has basketball
on Saturday at 12:00.

01:49:10.708 --> 01:49:11.828
Eleven, I'm sorry.

01:49:11.916 --> 01:49:14.206
So we go there, and then afterwards...

01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:18.540
maybe we'll get lunch somewhere
and then if there's a movie to see...

01:49:19.041 --> 01:49:20.541
Does he like basketball?

01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:21.880
He does.

01:49:21.958 --> 01:49:25.248
His coach, Rick, says
he's a good dribbler, and I've seen that.

01:49:25.708 --> 01:49:26.918
- Uh-huh.
- Ron.

01:49:27.791 --> 01:49:29.671
Sorry, his coach's name is Ron.

01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:31.330
Rick's his dentist in New York.

01:49:31.416 --> 01:49:34.536
Well, you know our home home was...
is in New York.

01:49:34.625 --> 01:49:35.915
That's where we live.

01:49:36.041 --> 01:49:38.171
New York is a long way from here.

01:49:38.666 --> 01:49:40.456
Well, we like it because we can walk.

01:49:40.541 --> 01:49:42.081
You can walk here.

01:49:42.458 --> 01:49:43.418
Not really.

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:44.830
And the space...

01:49:51.250 --> 01:49:52.670
Do you like your school?

01:49:53.666 --> 01:49:54.496
I love it.

01:49:54.958 --> 01:49:56.708
What's your favorite part about it?

01:49:57.541 --> 01:49:58.631
I don't know.

01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:00.881
Maybe gym.

01:50:01.291 --> 01:50:02.421
You like math.

01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:04.830
Not anymore.

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:07.956
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:50:08.041 --> 01:50:09.541
But you're getting really good at it.

01:50:09.625 --> 01:50:10.455
No.

01:50:11.541 --> 01:50:13.131
Well, you are, but...

01:50:15.666 --> 01:50:18.036
What do you
and your dad like to do together?

01:50:18.625 --> 01:50:21.415
When I'm at my dad's,
we sometimes watch a movie

01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.000
or build a Lego or something.

01:50:23.791 --> 01:50:25.671
My dad's a great Lego builder.

01:50:26.083 --> 01:50:27.383
And at your mom's?

01:50:28.166 --> 01:50:30.536
At home, I have most of my toys,

01:50:30.625 --> 01:50:34.125
and there's a pool
and I have a tree house and jungle gym.

01:50:35.875 --> 01:50:37.785
We have super secret treasure hunt,

01:50:37.875 --> 01:50:39.285
which is really fun.

01:50:40.833 --> 01:50:44.333
- Sweetheart?
- Army men ride in here and...

01:50:44.416 --> 01:50:45.916
Wanna help me set the table?

01:50:46.375 --> 01:50:47.535
Do I have to?

01:50:47.625 --> 01:50:50.075
- Just come in here and grab a plate.
- I'm playing.

01:50:50.166 --> 01:50:50.996
Henry?

01:50:52.041 --> 01:50:53.631
Okay.

01:50:54.416 --> 01:50:55.376
Fine.

01:50:59.458 --> 01:51:01.288
- Why are you being like this?
- What?

01:51:01.625 --> 01:51:03.245
If I ask you to help out, help out.

01:51:03.333 --> 01:51:05.753
- What is this?
- A special meal.

01:51:06.375 --> 01:51:07.955
What are the green things?

01:51:08.333 --> 01:51:10.463
There aren't green things
in a special meal.

01:51:10.541 --> 01:51:11.671
It's just the garnish.

01:51:12.833 --> 01:51:13.753
I'll take it off.

01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:16.880
I don't wanna eat anything it touched.

01:51:16.958 --> 01:51:20.538
- Doesn't change the taste of anything.
- I might wanna be a vegetarian.

01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:22.460
Mom's a vegetarian.

01:51:22.541 --> 01:51:23.921
Is she a vegetarian now?

01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:26.290
- Yeah.
- Well, then you should like garnish.

01:51:26.375 --> 01:51:28.245
It's all garnish, vegetarianism.

01:51:30.333 --> 01:51:31.673
I'm done with my water.

01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:43.130
Sure I can't get you anything?

01:51:43.208 --> 01:51:44.918
No, I'm fine, thank you.

01:51:47.458 --> 01:51:48.918
Do the thing with the knife.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.750
No, I'm not...

01:51:51.708 --> 01:51:52.538
No.

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:54.540
Come on.

01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:55.923
It's not a dinner thing.

01:51:59.041 --> 01:52:00.461
It's not an any time thing.

01:52:00.958 --> 01:52:02.578
What's the thing with the knife?

01:52:03.458 --> 01:52:04.708
It's hilarious.

01:52:04.791 --> 01:52:07.251
No, it's dumb.
I have a small knife on my keychain.

01:52:07.333 --> 01:52:08.633
Which is only for adults.

01:52:10.291 --> 01:52:11.751
I do a thing with it sometimes.

01:52:13.541 --> 01:52:15.131
You said I could get a knife.

01:52:15.625 --> 01:52:17.375
A jackknife, yeah, when you're older.

01:52:18.166 --> 01:52:19.076
Like ten.

01:52:19.625 --> 01:52:21.035
No, like 20.

01:52:21.666 --> 01:52:22.496
Yeah.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.380
Dime, rime, lime, pime, sime...

01:52:32.458 --> 01:52:34.458
Honey, stop guessing.
You're so close. Stay with it.

01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:36.711
Well, I don't wanna do it.

01:52:36.791 --> 01:52:38.041
What's the first letter?

01:52:38.125 --> 01:52:40.205
I don't wanna do it.
Can I do the iPad?

01:52:40.291 --> 01:52:41.751
No, look. What's the first letter?

01:52:42.208 --> 01:52:44.378
- I don't want to.
- It's a T. What sound does T make?

01:52:44.458 --> 01:52:46.668
- Tuh.
- Right. Then just do the rest of it.

01:52:47.333 --> 01:52:48.293
Dime.

01:52:49.208 --> 01:52:50.038
No.

01:52:50.125 --> 01:52:52.415
You have "tuh" and "ime." What is that?

01:52:55.583 --> 01:52:56.583
Time.

01:52:57.083 --> 01:52:57.923
It's "time."

01:52:59.291 --> 01:53:00.251
It's "time."

01:53:05.375 --> 01:53:07.535
You'll see, honey.
One day it's just gonna click

01:53:07.625 --> 01:53:08.915
and you'll be able to read everything.

01:53:10.375 --> 01:53:11.575
I need a break.

01:53:11.958 --> 01:53:13.748
Can I go play in my room?

01:53:13.833 --> 01:53:14.673
Sure.

01:53:17.041 --> 01:53:17.921
Hey.

01:53:20.208 --> 01:53:21.038
Yeah?

01:53:38.708 --> 01:53:40.418
Do you ever observe married people?

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.710
No. Why would I?

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.040
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:57.000
The knife thing is...

01:53:57.250 --> 01:53:59.170
I carry this knife on my keychain,

01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:00.790
which his mother got me actually.

01:54:02.541 --> 01:54:05.081
And I do this thing for his mom
where I pretend to cut myself,

01:54:05.166 --> 01:54:07.576
but I retract the blade,
but I don't do it with him.

01:54:11.041 --> 01:54:11.881
Oh.

01:54:13.333 --> 01:54:14.793
- That's fine.
- Are you okay?

01:54:14.875 --> 01:54:17.285
Yeah, I must not have retracted
the blade all the way.

01:54:17.375 --> 01:54:18.205
- Do you need...
- Yeah.

01:54:20.208 --> 01:54:22.378
Yeah, no, it's fine.

01:54:22.833 --> 01:54:24.083
What else can I tell you?

01:54:25.333 --> 01:54:26.673
I think I have enough.

01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:27.790
You have enough?

01:54:28.375 --> 01:54:30.995
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Totally. I'm fine.

01:54:32.125 --> 01:54:34.625
Well, I'll leave you guys for tonight.

01:54:35.125 --> 01:54:36.075
Oh, okay.

01:54:37.041 --> 01:54:40.041
I'll be in touch
if I have further questions.

01:54:41.791 --> 01:54:43.041
Oh, thanks.

01:54:44.833 --> 01:54:46.003
Oh, thanks.

01:54:49.083 --> 01:54:51.213
Thanks. Thank you for the water.

01:54:51.291 --> 01:54:53.831
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Are you sure you're okay?

01:54:53.916 --> 01:54:55.286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:54:56.208 --> 01:54:57.458
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:55:02.416 --> 01:55:03.826
Oh. Sorry.

01:55:05.250 --> 01:55:06.420
All right, let...

01:55:09.208 --> 01:55:10.578
I think you turn the...

01:55:14.916 --> 01:55:16.036
Sorry.

01:55:16.125 --> 01:55:16.955
Okay.

01:56:20.541 --> 01:56:21.751
Dad, are you okay?

01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:23.830
Yeah, I'm just tired.

01:56:41.041 --> 01:56:42.581
Dad, did she like us?

01:56:44.708 --> 01:56:47.168
Yeah, she thought we were great.

01:58:20.208 --> 01:58:21.538
- Come on.
- Guys, slow down.

01:58:23.208 --> 01:58:24.418
So...

01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:26.880
because Charlie dropped his claim
to New York,

01:58:26.958 --> 01:58:28.208
we're mostly done.

01:58:28.291 --> 01:58:32.001
Jay's lost interest,
Ted, his associate's, doing the paperwork.

01:58:32.083 --> 01:58:33.923
And we're not taking any money, right?

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.080
We withdrew our claim for the MacArthur,

01:58:36.166 --> 01:58:37.996
which I think
we could have gotten, by the way,

01:58:38.416 --> 01:58:40.666
and they're not asking
for any of the show.

01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:43.210
Thank you for everything, Nora.

01:58:43.708 --> 01:58:44.918
You're welcome, doll.

01:58:45.916 --> 01:58:47.626
To your new home in LA.

01:58:52.916 --> 01:58:55.376
And whenever Charlie is in LA,

01:58:55.458 --> 01:58:58.418
I got the custody breakdown to be 55/45.

01:58:58.833 --> 01:59:01.673
So you'll have Henry an extra day
every two weeks.

01:59:02.208 --> 01:59:03.538
I thought we made an equal.

01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:05.540
I tweaked it at the last minute.

01:59:05.625 --> 01:59:08.375
I just didn't want him
to be able to say he got 50/50,

01:59:08.458 --> 01:59:09.878
bragging to his friends.

01:59:10.375 --> 01:59:12.415
- But I don't wanna do that.
- Take it.

01:59:12.833 --> 01:59:14.253
You won.

01:59:40.291 --> 01:59:42.581
Hi. You look like a guy
who really cares about animals.

01:59:42.666 --> 01:59:43.496
Nope.

02:00:03.541 --> 02:00:04.881
Oh, my God!

02:00:05.375 --> 02:00:06.205
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:00:16.041 --> 02:00:17.381
You hear some guy screaming?

02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:24.210
The couch was technically hers,
pre-marriage.

02:00:24.291 --> 02:00:26.421
But, I mean, it was our couch.

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:27.960
It's not like
I was gonna buy another couch.

02:00:28.041 --> 02:00:30.331
But then when it comes time to split,
it's suddenly her couch.

02:00:30.416 --> 02:00:31.826
And I have no couch and...

02:00:34.875 --> 02:00:36.995
I'm sitting on the floor
is the short version.

02:00:39.666 --> 02:00:42.496
I'm sorry.
This is all so self-pitying and boring.

02:00:42.583 --> 02:00:43.503
No, come on.

02:00:43.583 --> 02:00:45.463
No, I'm so stupid. I'm sorry.

02:00:45.541 --> 02:00:47.881
- Sounds really tough.
- No, it is sad.

02:04:08.833 --> 02:04:09.673
Hello?

02:04:19.958 --> 02:04:20.788
Hello?

02:04:22.916 --> 02:04:24.956
Hi, sorry, the door was open.

02:04:26.041 --> 02:04:27.211
Oh. Okay.

02:04:29.291 --> 02:04:30.501
Whoa! Gotcha!

02:04:32.583 --> 02:04:35.043
Charlie, oh!

02:04:35.125 --> 02:04:36.665
Was your flight okay?

02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:38.130
- Yeah.
- Carter.

02:04:38.208 --> 02:04:39.288
Charlie.

02:04:39.375 --> 02:04:40.415
Nicole's still at work.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.330
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:04:49.416 --> 02:04:50.326
Can I I get a hug?

02:04:55.583 --> 02:04:57.083
Hey, how'd it go?

02:04:57.166 --> 02:04:57.996
Good, yeah.

02:04:58.083 --> 02:05:00.383
And Donny's dead now.
I shot the scene where...

02:05:00.458 --> 02:05:02.378
- Henry's upstairs.
- She got an Emmy nomination.

02:05:02.916 --> 02:05:05.206
- She's a great actress.
- No, for directing.

02:05:06.875 --> 02:05:08.705
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

02:05:08.791 --> 02:05:11.211
Now I know what you were
so obsessed with all the time.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.580
- We should get ready.
- Yeah.

02:05:13.666 --> 02:05:14.956
Oh, we're the Beatles.

02:05:15.041 --> 02:05:17.081
- Come on, Charlie.
- I didn't get a costume together.

02:05:17.166 --> 02:05:19.286
- You could be George Martin.
- I don't need to be anyone.

02:05:19.375 --> 02:05:21.455
- You've gotta be something.
- A ghost. I'll get you a sheet.

02:05:21.541 --> 02:05:23.671
I have the album cover
if anyone needs to reference it.

02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:25.250
And we should leave soon.

02:05:25.333 --> 02:05:27.463
I'm saying that as much for me
as anyone else.

02:05:27.541 --> 02:05:29.331
- Am I John or George?
- Trick-or-treating starts at 5:00.

02:05:29.416 --> 02:05:30.996
You're George. Nicole is John.

02:05:37.916 --> 02:05:40.876
I wanted to tell you
I took a residency at UCLA.

02:05:42.416 --> 02:05:44.876
I'm gonna direct two plays
and rep at REDCAT.

02:05:46.958 --> 02:05:47.788
Oh.

02:05:48.791 --> 02:05:49.921
So I'll be here for a while.

02:05:53.583 --> 02:05:54.463
That's great.

02:05:57.708 --> 02:05:58.628
Are you okay?

02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:02.080
Yeah.

02:06:04.666 --> 02:06:05.746
It's only good.

02:06:06.541 --> 02:06:07.581
Nicole?

02:06:07.666 --> 02:06:09.706
Can you help me with my zipper?

02:06:30.166 --> 02:06:33.876
"Charlie is incr..." something.

02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:35.580
"Neat"

02:06:35.666 --> 02:06:39.076
and I rely on him

02:06:39.541 --> 02:06:43.921
to keep things in order.

02:06:44.916 --> 02:06:46.916
"He is energy con..."

02:06:48.041 --> 02:06:51.041
- I don't know what this word is.
- You're getting so good at reading.

02:06:51.875 --> 02:06:52.995
What is that?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.500
"He doesn't look in the mirror too often."

02:06:59.958 --> 02:07:02.168
He cries easily

02:07:02.583 --> 02:07:04.543
in movies.

02:07:05.791 --> 02:07:08.251
"He is very self-suf..."

02:07:09.166 --> 02:07:10.206
Self-sufficient.

02:07:11.791 --> 02:07:14.921
"He can darn a sock..."

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.420
That means sew, like a hole.

02:07:18.083 --> 02:07:21.253
"And cook himself dinner

02:07:21.666 --> 02:07:24.456
and ur..."

02:07:24.541 --> 02:07:25.671
Break it into two parts.

02:07:26.083 --> 02:07:27.883
"Ur on."

02:07:27.958 --> 02:07:29.828
Not "ur" but "ire."

02:07:29.916 --> 02:07:30.996
Ire. on.

02:07:31.083 --> 02:07:32.003
Iron.

02:07:33.833 --> 02:07:35.083
"A shirt."

02:07:36.958 --> 02:07:40.288
He rarely gets defeated

02:07:40.583 --> 02:07:43.003
which I fell...

02:07:44.291 --> 02:07:47.631
feel like I always do.

02:07:48.833 --> 02:07:52.133
Charlie takes all of my moods steadily.

02:07:52.708 --> 02:07:54.958
He doesn't give in to them

02:07:55.208 --> 02:07:57.628
or make me feel bad about them.

02:07:58.458 --> 02:08:00.788
"He's a great dresser
and never looks em..."

02:08:01.291 --> 02:08:03.381
- I don't know this one.
- Embarrassing.

02:08:04.208 --> 02:08:05.248
"Embarrassing,

02:08:05.666 --> 02:08:08.996
which is hard for a man."

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.040
You read it now.

02:08:13.333 --> 02:08:14.753
"He's very competitive."

02:08:15.916 --> 02:08:17.626
He loves being a dad.

02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:20.960
He loves all the things
you're supposed to hate,

02:08:21.416 --> 02:08:22.786
like the tantrums,

02:08:23.416 --> 02:08:24.786
the waking up at night.

02:08:25.375 --> 02:08:28.035
It's almost annoying
how much he likes it,

02:08:28.375 --> 02:08:29.785
but then it's mostly nice.

02:08:30.958 --> 02:08:32.878
He disappears into his own world.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
He and Henry are alike that way.

02:08:36.666 --> 02:08:37.826
He can tell

02:08:38.208 --> 02:08:40.998
people they have food in their teeth

02:08:41.708 --> 02:08:44.538
or on their face in a way
that doesn't make them feel bad.

02:08:45.583 --> 02:08:46.923
Charlie is self-made.

02:08:47.291 --> 02:08:49.751
His parents, I only met them once,

02:08:49.833 --> 02:08:52.583
but he told me
there was a lot of alcohol...

02:08:56.250 --> 02:08:58.710
He moved to New York from Indiana

02:08:59.291 --> 02:09:00.501
with no safety net,

02:09:00.583 --> 02:09:03.213
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

02:09:04.083 --> 02:09:07.043
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

02:09:07.458 --> 02:09:08.788
With the theater company...

02:09:09.666 --> 02:09:11.166
he casts a spell...

02:09:11.791 --> 02:09:14.251
that made everyone feel included.

02:09:14.791 --> 02:09:17.631
"No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant."

02:09:18.958 --> 02:09:19.998
What's an intern?

02:09:20.833 --> 02:09:21.923
It's like a...

02:09:22.583 --> 02:09:24.333
helper, but who isn't paid.

02:09:24.416 --> 02:09:25.666
Why aren't they paid?

02:09:26.875 --> 02:09:28.575
They're young, they're learning.

02:09:30.125 --> 02:09:32.665
I don't know, maybe if they do a good job,
they get paid later.

02:09:33.208 --> 02:09:34.458
Okay, keep going.

02:09:35.791 --> 02:09:39.671
"He could remember all the inside jokes,
he's extremely organized and thorough,"

02:09:39.916 --> 02:09:43.286
he's very clear about what he wants,
unlike me who can't always tell.

02:09:43.875 --> 02:09:46.915
I fell in love with him
two seconds after I saw him.

02:10:10.625 --> 02:10:12.075
And I'll never stop loving him,

02:10:12.541 --> 02:10:14.461
"even though
it doesn't make sense anymore."

02:10:28.875 --> 02:10:30.455
See you. Good to see you again.

02:10:30.541 --> 02:10:31.541
Good seeing you too.

02:10:31.625 --> 02:10:33.205
- Oh, Charlie!
- G-ma.

02:10:33.291 --> 02:10:34.791
I'm so happy you came.

02:10:35.416 --> 02:10:36.956
I'll email you that article.

02:10:37.041 --> 02:10:39.041
- Yes, please do. Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:10:39.125 --> 02:10:40.075
Take care.

02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:47.040
We were gonna bring him to dinner,
but he's so wiped out.

02:10:47.583 --> 02:10:48.673
You wanna take him?

02:10:50.125 --> 02:10:52.125
- It's your night.
- I know.

02:10:52.208 --> 02:10:53.288
- Yeah.
- Good.

02:10:53.375 --> 02:10:54.575
- I'll drop him back in the morning.
- Yeah.

02:10:54.666 --> 02:10:56.246
Text me when you're up.
We'll figure something out.

02:10:56.333 --> 02:10:57.883
You're gonna go with your dad, okay?

02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:59.500
- Okay.
- Yeah?

02:11:11.416 --> 02:11:12.326
I love you.

02:11:12.916 --> 02:11:14.036
I love you too.

02:11:19.916 --> 02:11:20.746
Oh, hey.

02:11:32.833 --> 02:11:33.883
Thanks.
