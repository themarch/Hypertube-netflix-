00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.880
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.790
It was too dark to see much,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.130
but I'm pretty sure it was a wolf.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.120
A wolf bit you?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.830
Class, this is our new
student, Allison Argent.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.600
What the hell is going on with you, McCall?

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.910
I can see, hear, and smell things

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.750
that I shouldn't be able
to see hear and smell!

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:15.690
What are you doing here?

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.700
That was Derek Hale.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.580
His family, they all
burned to death in a fire,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.440
like, ten years ago.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.740
Do you think maybe you'd like to go to

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.650
that party with me?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.830
Definitely yes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.470
Is this a party or a date?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.560
Maybe both.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.270
And her name is...

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.180
Allison.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.030
I just made first line,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.900
I've got a date with a girl

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.370
I can't believe wants to go out with me,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.110
and everything in my
life is somehow perfect.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.370
Why you trying to ruin it?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.130
Aah! Aah! Who are they?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.350
Hunters, the kind who have
been hunting us for centuries.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.700
That's my dad.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.620
Whoo hoo hoo!

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.020
Did you apologize to Allison?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.310
Yeah.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.530
Is she giving you a second chance or...

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.660
Yeah.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.430
Yeah! All right.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.580
So everything's good.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.030
No.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.600
No?

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.290
Remember...The hunters.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.800
Her dad is one of 'em.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.470
Her dad?

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.290
Shot me...

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.760
Allison's father?

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.630
With a crossbow.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.660
Allison's father--

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.360
Yes! Her father!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.020
Oh, my God.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.190
No, Scott. Snap back.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.180
You okay? Hey, all right?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.430
He didn't recognize you, right?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.660
No. N-no. I don't think so.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.820
Does she know about him?

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.100
Oh, yeah. I don't know.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.980
What if she does?

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.420
This is gonna kill me, man.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.650
Okay, just focus on lacrosse.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.600
Okay, here, Scott.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.500
Take this.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.090
Take this, and focus on
lacrosse for now, okay?

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.860
That's all you gotta do, yeah?

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.670
Lacrosse.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.810
Here we go!

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.740
Let's go!

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.240
One-on-one from up top!

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.700
Jackson...Take a long stick today.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.490
Atta boy.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.780
Kill it, Jack.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.290
That's how you do it!

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.810
Greenberg, take a lap.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.890
Let's go.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.190
Faster, Greenberg!

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.430
Let's go.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.250
McCall, what are you waiting for?

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.930
Let's go.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.930
Hey, McCall.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.280
Hey, McCall!

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.360
You sure you still want
to be first line, McCall?

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.170
My--my grandmother can
move faster than that.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.620
And she's dead.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.780
You think you can move faster than the...

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.840
Lifeless corpse of my dead grandmother?

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.370
Yes, coach.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.700
I can't hear you.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.280
Yes, coach.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.340
Then do it again.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.960
McCall's gonna do it again!

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.630
McCall's gonna do it again!

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.110
Let's go!

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.450
Uhh!

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.920
Ohh.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.130
Scott?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.290
Scott, you okay?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.070
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.650
I can't control it, Stiles.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.330
It's happening.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.610
What? Right here? Now?

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.780
Come on, get up. Come on.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.930
Come on.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.190
Come on, here we go.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.390
There. That's it.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.870
You okay? Scott, you okay?

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.730
Get away from me!

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.880
Stiles...

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.220
What happened?

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.810
You tried to kill me.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.160
It's like I told you before.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.110
It's the anger.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.390
It's your pulse rising.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.570
It's a trigger.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.940
But that's lacrosse.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.160
It's a pretty violent game,
if you hadn't noticed.

00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:00.510
Well, it's gonna be a lot more violent

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.390
if you end up killing someone on the field.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.100
You can't play Saturday.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.430
You're gonna have to get out of the game.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.870
I'm first line.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.390
Not anymore.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.960
Hey.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.730
Late shift again for me.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.970
But I am taking Saturday off
to see your first game.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.680
Oh, mom, you can't.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.650
Oh, no, I can and I will.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.880
Come on, one shift isn't gonna break us.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.720
Completely.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.230
Hey, what's wrong with your eyes?

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.360
You look like you haven't slept in days.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.570
Oh, uh, it's nothing.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.820
I'm just...stressed.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.060
Just stress?

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.490
Nothin' else?

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.410
Homework.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.230
I mean, it's not like you're
on drugs or anything, right?

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.590
Right now?

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.900
Right now?

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.400
I'm sorry, what do you mean "right now"?

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.280
Have you ever taken drugs?

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.480
Have you?

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.800
Get some sleep.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.190
What'd you find out?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.130
Well, it's bad.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.710
Jackson's got a separated shoulder.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.400
Because of me?

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.540
Because he's a tool.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.730
Well, is he gonna play?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.920
Well, they don't know yet.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.960
Now they're just counting
on you for Saturday.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.620
What?

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.520
It looks like what?

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.700
Come on.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.010
Damn it.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.280
What?

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.920
I saw you on the field.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.850
Wha-what are you talking about?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.200
You shifted in front of them!

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.720
If they find out what you are,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.960
they find out about me.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.170
About all of us.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.730
And it is not just the hunters after us,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.970
it's everyone.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.080
But...They didn't see anything!

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.210
I..s-swear, I--

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.290
And they won't!

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.080
Because if you even try to play

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.510
in that game on Saturday...

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.610
I'm gonna kill you myself.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.070
What do you mean, you can't play
the game tomorrow night?

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.590
I mean...I can't play the
game tomorrow night.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.050
You can't wait to play
the game tomorrow night.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.760
No, coach, I can't play
the game tomorrow night.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.870
I'm not following.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.220
I'm having some personal issues.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.370
Is it a girl?

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.400
No.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.720
Is it a guy?

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.530
You know, our goalie Danny is gay.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.330
Yeah, I know, coach, but that's not it.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.840
You don't think Danny's a...

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.390
good-lookin' guy?

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.230
I...think he's good-looking.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.600
I--but I--I like girls.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.340
And that's not it, anyway! I-I--

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.560
What, is it drugs?

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.680
Are you doing meth?

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.810
Because I had a brother
that was addicted to meth.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.010
You should have seen what
it did to his teeth--

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.130
They were all cracked and rotted.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.890
It was--it was disgusting.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.060
My...God.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.150
What happened to him?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.390
He got veneers.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.800
Is--is that what this is about?

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.560
Are you afraid of getting hurt, McCall?

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.010
No...I'm...

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.480
Having some issues dealing with aggression.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.900
Well, here's the good news.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.960
That's why you play lacrosse.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.650
Problem solved.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.460
Coach, I can't play the
game tomorrow night.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.890
Listen, McCall, part of playing first line

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.210
is taking on the responsibility
of being first line.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.270
Now, if you can't shoulder
that responsibility,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.270
then you're back on the
bench until you're ready.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.300
If I don't play the game,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.180
you're taking me off first line?

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.320
McCall, play the game.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.970
Slide it up and half-asleep

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.310
Hey.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.499
Hey.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.410
Busy?

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.970
No, no, it's just, uh,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.170
my mom, she's nothing.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.690
I mean, it's nothing.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.680
Uh, I'm never busy for you.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.760
I like the sound of that.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.080
I have to run to French class,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.890
but I wanted you to know that

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.090
I'm coming to see you play tomorrow.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.060
You are?

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.450
And we're all going out afterwards.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.060
You, me, Lydia, Jackson.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.150
It's gonna be great.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.430
Tell Stiles to come too.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.680
Uh, save me a seat at lunch. I gotta go.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.120
Oh, God.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.170
Why is there a rumor going around

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.360
that you're not playing tomorrow?

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.130
'Cause I'm sort of not.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.770
I think you sort of are.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.840
Especially when you brutally

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.370
injure my boyfriend by ramming into him.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.830
He brutally injured
himself ramming into me.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.340
Jackson's gonna play tomorrow.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.530
But he's not gonna be at his peak,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.820
and I prefer my boyfriend
at peak performance.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.640
Okay.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.730
I date the captain of the
winning lacrosse team,

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.940
and if they start off the season losing,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.320
I date the captain of the
losing lacrosse team.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.200
I don't date losers.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.230
Losing one game isn't gonna kill anyone.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.050
In fact, it might even save someone.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.780
Fine! Don't play.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.270
We'll probably win anyway.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.920
Then we'll go out after,
like we were planning...

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.230
And I'll introduce Allison to

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.600
all the hot players on the team.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.110
And Scott McCall can stay home,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.540
surfing the net for porn.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.190
Mr. McCall, you're not even
close to solving your problem.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.390
Tell me about it.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.440
Hey, come here.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.190
What?

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.250
Come here.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.610
Tell me what they're saying.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.240
Can you hear 'em?

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.770
Want everyone under the age of 18
to be in their home by 9:30 p.m.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.890
We'd like to institute the
curfew, effective immediately.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.800
Look, we don't...

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.470
Curfew because of the body.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.530
Unbelievable.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.610
My dad's out looking for a rabid
animal, while the jerk-off

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.600
who actually killed the
girl is just hangin' out,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.770
doing whatever he wants.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.000
Well, you can't exactly tell

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.470
your dad the truth about Derek.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.570
I can do something.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.560
Like what?

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.940
Find the other half of the body.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.140
Are you kidding?

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.150
This is Allison.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:12.870
Hi.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.080
Nice to meet you.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.120
She's the new girl.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.150
She just moved here.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:17.890
Oh, how do you like it?

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:18.830
I like it.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.540
So Lydia's introducing you to everyone?

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.190
She's being so unbelievably nice to me.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.510
I wonder why.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.620
Maybe she gets how much being
the new girl can suck.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.420
Where did you get that?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.030
My jacket?

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.150
It was in my locker.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.840
I think Lydia brought
it back from the party.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.710
She has my combination--

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.790
Did she say she brought it back

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.020
or did somebody give her the jacket?

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.250
Like who?

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.170
Like Derek.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.090
Your friend?

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.350
He's not my friend.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.860
How much did you talk to him

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.050
when he drove you home?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.860
Mmm, not much at all.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.150
What did you say?

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.040
I...gotta get to class.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.700
Allison--

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.960
No, I really have to go.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.430
Derek!

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.270
Derek!

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.030
Stay away from her!

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.480
She doesn't know anything!

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.640
Yeah?

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.520
What if she does?

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.790
You think your little buddy Stiles

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.560
can just Google werewolves,

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.170
and now you got all the
answers, is that it?

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.580
You don't get it yet, Scott,

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.960
but I'm looking out for you.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.530
Think about what could happen.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.520
You're out on the field.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.720
The aggression takes over.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.840
And you shift in front of everyone.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.040
Your mom, all your friends.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.200
And when they see you...

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.460
Everything falls apart.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.400
What did you find?

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.400
How did you find it?

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.450
Where did you find it?

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.430
And, yes, I've had a lot of Adderall, so...

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.950
I found something of Derek Hale's.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.860
Are you kidding? What?

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.180
There's something buried there--

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.190
I could smell blood.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.190
That's awesome!

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.080
I mean, that's terrible.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.180
Whose blood?

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.480
I don't know.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.090
But when we do, your dad
nails Derek for the murder.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.480
And then you help me figure out

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.730
how to play lacrosse without changing.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.720
Because there's no way I'm
not playing that game.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.270
Hey.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.320
Okay.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.180
Good luck, I guess.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.570
***

00:15:03.712 --> 00:15:04.973
Hey, Lydia.

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:07.579
You probably don't remember me.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.842
Um, I sit behind you in Biology.

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:14.245
Uh, anyway, I always thought

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:16.077
that we just had this kind of connection.

00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:19.258
Unspoken, of course.

00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:21.054
Maybe it'd be kind of cool to,

00:15:21.752 --> 00:15:23.495
get to know each other a little better.

00:15:23.496 --> 00:15:25.234
Hold on, give me a second.

00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:27.516
Yeah, I didn't get any
of what you just said.

00:15:27.517 --> 00:15:28.552
Is it worth repeating?

00:15:30.665 --> 00:15:31.683
No.

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:33.411
Sorry.

00:15:35.905 --> 00:15:36.971
I'll just sit.

00:15:37.547 --> 00:15:38.392
You don't care.

00:15:38.393 --> 00:15:39.354
Okay.

00:16:40.349 --> 00:16:41.262
Did he do it?

00:16:41.263 --> 00:16:42.504
He said not to make a habit of it,

00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:44.350
but one cortitisone shot won't kill me.

00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:45.718
You should get one right
before the game too.

00:16:46.616 --> 00:16:48.090
The pros do it all the time.

00:16:48.873 --> 00:16:50.431
You want to be a little
high school amateur?

00:16:50.432 --> 00:16:54.316
Or...do you want to go...

00:16:54.631 --> 00:16:56.075
Pro?

00:17:04.393 --> 00:17:05.765
Ohh! God!

00:17:05.766 --> 00:17:07.115
The scent was the same.

00:17:07.116 --> 00:17:07.954
You sure?

00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:09.062
Yes.

00:17:09.872 --> 00:17:12.303
So he did bury the other half
of the body on his property?

00:17:12.304 --> 00:17:13.840
Which means we have proof
he killed the girl.

00:17:14.389 --> 00:17:15.456
I say we use it.

00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:17.640
How?

00:17:17.641 --> 00:17:18.950
Tell me something first.

00:17:19.228 --> 00:17:20.836
Are you doing this because
you want to stop Derek,

00:17:20.837 --> 00:17:21.925
or because you want to play in the game,

00:17:21.926 --> 00:17:23.010
and he said you couldn't?

00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:25.431
There are bite marks on the
legs, Stiles--bite marks.

00:17:25.876 --> 00:17:26.843
Okay.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.292
Then we're gonna need a shovel.

00:18:03.612 --> 00:18:05.035
Wait, something's different.

00:18:06.446 --> 00:18:07.621
Different how?

00:18:08.612 --> 00:18:09.524
I don't know.

00:18:13.412 --> 00:18:15.024
Let's just get this over with.

00:18:36.579 --> 00:18:37.806
This is taking way too long.

00:18:37.807 --> 00:18:39.007
Just keep going.

00:18:39.312 --> 00:18:40.071
What if he comes back?

00:18:40.072 --> 00:18:41.343
When we get the hell out of here.

00:18:41.344 --> 00:18:42.656
What if he catches us?

00:18:42.857 --> 00:18:43.852
I have a plan for that.

00:18:43.853 --> 00:18:44.705
Which is?

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.096
You run one way.

00:18:47.097 --> 00:18:48.026
I run the other.

00:18:48.027 --> 00:18:49.560
Whoever he catches first, too bad.

00:18:50.532 --> 00:18:51.811
I hate that plan.

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:54.097
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

00:19:02.312 --> 00:19:03.111
Hurry.

00:19:03.112 --> 00:19:04.293
I'm trying. Did he have to

00:19:04.294 --> 00:19:06.424
tie the thing in, like, 900 knots?

00:19:06.744 --> 00:19:07.683
I'll do it.

00:19:20.772 --> 00:19:22.234
What the hell is that?

00:19:22.792 --> 00:19:23.566
It's a wolf.

00:19:23.567 --> 00:19:24.958
Yeah, I can see that.

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:27.953
I thought you said you smelled
blood, as in human blood.

00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:29.988
I told you something was different.

00:19:31.078 --> 00:19:32.251
This doesn't make sense.

00:19:32.252 --> 00:19:33.084
We gotta get out of here.

00:19:33.085 --> 00:19:33.985
Yeah.

00:19:33.986 --> 00:19:35.325
Okay, help me cover this up.

00:19:39.226 --> 00:19:40.297
What's wrong?

00:19:40.298 --> 00:19:41.355
You see that flower?

00:19:42.576 --> 00:19:43.540
What about it?

00:19:43.896 --> 00:19:45.204
I think it's wolfsbane.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.653
What's that?

00:19:48.802 --> 00:19:50.315
Uh...Haven't you ever seen the Wolf Man?

00:19:50.316 --> 00:19:51.029
No.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.381
Lon Chaney Jr.?

00:19:52.673 --> 00:19:53.780
Claude Rains.

00:19:54.888 --> 00:19:56.810
The original, classic werewolf movie?

00:19:56.811 --> 00:19:57.961
No! What?

00:19:58.878 --> 00:20:00.639
You are so unprepared for this.

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:44.174
Stiles.

00:20:47.726 --> 00:20:49.374
Holy...

00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:28.158
No.

00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:32.881
Oh, God.

00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:35.966
Okay, just so you know,

00:21:35.967 --> 00:21:37.464
I'm not afraid of you.

00:21:39.645 --> 00:21:41.012
Okay, maybe I am.

00:21:41.243 --> 00:21:42.176
Doesn't matter.

00:21:42.928 --> 00:21:44.290
I just wanna know something.

00:21:44.989 --> 00:21:46.108
The girl you killed...

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:47.750
She was a werewolf.

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.776
She was a different kind, wasn't she?

00:21:50.232 --> 00:21:52.242
I mean, she could turn
herself into an actual wolf,

00:21:52.243 --> 00:21:53.681
and I know Scott can't do that.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.832
Is that why you killed her?

00:21:56.826 --> 00:21:58.296
Why are you so worried about me

00:21:58.297 --> 00:22:00.142
when it's your friend who's the problem?

00:22:00.143 --> 00:22:01.058
When he shifts on the field,

00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:02.297
what do you think they're gonna do.

00:22:03.262 --> 00:22:04.715
Just keep cheering him on?

00:22:05.294 --> 00:22:07.325
I can't stop him from playing, but you can.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.955
And, trust me...

00:22:11.983 --> 00:22:12.998
You want to.

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:21.346
There. Stand.

00:22:23.603 --> 00:22:24.500
What the hell do you think you're doing?

00:22:24.501 --> 00:22:25.607
I'm just trying to help.

00:22:26.798 --> 00:22:28.594
Okay, well, how 'bout
you help me understand

00:22:28.595 --> 00:22:31.128
exactly how you came across this.

00:22:31.715 --> 00:22:33.365
We were looking for Scott's inhaler.

00:22:33.366 --> 00:22:34.640
Which he dropped when?

00:22:34.641 --> 00:22:35.707
The other night.

00:22:35.708 --> 00:22:36.448
The other night when you were out here

00:22:36.449 --> 00:22:37.608
looking for the first half of the body.

00:22:37.609 --> 00:22:38.642
Yes.

00:22:38.643 --> 00:22:40.559
The night that you told me you were alone

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.720
and Scott was at home.

00:22:41.721 --> 00:22:42.610
Yes.

00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:45.068
No. Oh, crap.

00:22:45.069 --> 00:22:46.267
So you lied to me.

00:22:46.268 --> 00:22:48.285
That depends on how you define lying.

00:22:48.286 --> 00:22:49.781
Well, I define it as not telling the truth.

00:22:49.782 --> 00:22:50.854
How do you define it?

00:22:52.359 --> 00:22:56.356
Mm, reclining your body
in a horizontal position?

00:22:56.357 --> 00:22:57.750
- Get the hell out of here.
- Absolutely.

00:23:03.226 --> 00:23:06.090
I can't find anything about
wolfsbane being used for burial.

00:23:06.091 --> 00:23:07.226
Just keep looking.

00:23:08.305 --> 00:23:09.736
Maybe it's like a ritual or something,

00:23:09.737 --> 00:23:11.448
like maybe they bury you as a wolf.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.917
Or maybe it's like a
special skill, you know?

00:23:13.918 --> 00:23:15.349
Like something you have to learn.

00:23:15.879 --> 00:23:17.229
I'll put it on my to-do list,

00:23:18.039 --> 00:23:19.212
right underneath figuring out how the hell

00:23:19.213 --> 00:23:20.526
I'm playing this game tonight.

00:23:20.527 --> 00:23:21.941
Maybe it's different for girl werewolves.

00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:23.675
Okay! Stop it!

00:23:24.795 --> 00:23:25.478
Stop what?

00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:26.803
Stop saying "werewolves"!

00:23:26.804 --> 00:23:28.315
Stop enjoying this so much.

00:23:28.316 --> 00:23:28.977
Are you okay?

00:23:28.978 --> 00:23:31.261
No! No, I'm not.

00:23:31.262 --> 00:23:33.109
I'm so far from being okay.

00:23:33.515 --> 00:23:34.844
You know, you're gonna have to accept this,

00:23:34.845 --> 00:23:35.876
Scott, sooner or later.

00:23:35.877 --> 00:23:36.566
I can't.

00:23:36.567 --> 00:23:37.432
Well, you're gonna have to.

00:23:37.433 --> 00:23:40.762
No! I can't breathe. Aah!

00:23:44.074 --> 00:23:45.030
Ah, pull over!

00:23:45.031 --> 00:23:45.970
Why? What's happening?

00:23:50.575 --> 00:23:51.539
You kept it?

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.952
What was I supposed to do with it?

00:23:53.719 --> 00:23:55.135
Stop the car!

00:23:57.368 --> 00:23:58.217
Okay...

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:05.873
Okay.

00:24:06.097 --> 00:24:07.017
We're good, you can...

00:24:10.648 --> 00:24:11.600
Scott?

00:24:18.733 --> 00:24:20.034
Scott?

00:24:28.877 --> 00:24:30.091
Odd how?

00:24:30.092 --> 00:24:32.571
Uh, like an odd person or...

00:24:33.199 --> 00:24:35.689
A dog-like individual roaming the streets.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:36.810
I'm hanging up on you now.

00:24:36.811 --> 00:24:37.911
No! Wai-wai-wai-wai-wait!

00:24:37.912 --> 00:24:38.827
Good bye!

00:25:27.522 --> 00:25:28.452
Dad?

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:32.163
Dad! What the hell are you doing?

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.524
He--he came out of nowhere, Allison.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.163
Are you trying to kill him?

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.657
No, no, of course not.

00:25:37.658 --> 00:25:39.280
He just--he just ran out into the driveway.

00:25:39.281 --> 00:25:40.352
I'm sorry.

00:25:40.762 --> 00:25:42.691
- It's my fault. I'm sorry.
- You okay?

00:25:42.692 --> 00:25:44.961
Yeah. Y-yeah, I'm fine.

00:25:45.123 --> 00:25:46.256
I swear.

00:25:47.056 --> 00:25:48.558
Sorry I hit your car.

00:25:49.358 --> 00:25:51.146
I was just coming to say hi.

00:25:53.912 --> 00:25:54.972
You sure you're okay?

00:25:55.327 --> 00:25:56.304
Yeah.

00:25:56.546 --> 00:25:58.159
Yeah, completely.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.577
Uhh. I should go, I've got a...

00:26:02.152 --> 00:26:03.776
Lacrosse game to get to.

00:26:04.536 --> 00:26:05.802
You're still coming, right?

00:26:06.931 --> 00:26:08.133
Of course I'm coming.

00:26:10.496 --> 00:26:11.555
We both are.

00:26:43.028 --> 00:26:44.682
You gonna try to convince me not to play?

00:26:44.805 --> 00:26:46.076
I just hope you know what you're doing.

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:50.042
If I don't play, I lose
first line and Allison.

00:26:50.043 --> 00:26:51.520
Allison's not going anywhere.

00:26:51.738 --> 00:26:53.558
And it's one game that you
really don't need to play.

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:54.695
I wanna play!

00:26:55.928 --> 00:26:56.926
I wanna be on the team.

00:26:56.927 --> 00:26:58.380
I wanna go out with Allison.

00:26:58.777 --> 00:27:01.151
I want a semi-freaking normal life.

00:27:01.766 --> 00:27:02.777
Do you get that?

00:27:03.377 --> 00:27:04.297
I get it.

00:27:09.556 --> 00:27:11.740
Just try not to worry too much
while you're out there, okay?

00:27:12.075 --> 00:27:13.184
Or get too angry.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.510
I got it.

00:27:14.511 --> 00:27:15.719
Or stressed.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.669
I got it.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.002
Don't think about Allison
being in the stands.

00:27:19.858 --> 00:27:21.564
Or that her father's trying to kill you.

00:27:22.502 --> 00:27:24.040
Or that Derek's trying to kill you.

00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:26.260
Or the girl he killed.

00:27:26.309 --> 00:27:27.763
Or that you might kill someone.

00:27:27.764 --> 00:27:29.650
If a hunter doesn't kill you first...
I'm sorry.

00:27:29.651 --> 00:27:30.454
I'll stop.

00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:33.004
Good luck.

00:27:51.802 --> 00:27:52.630
Scott...

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.305
I just want you to remember
one thing for tonight.

00:27:56.077 --> 00:27:58.559
Uh...Winning isn't everything?

00:28:02.107 --> 00:28:03.478
Nobody likes a loser.

00:28:06.446 --> 00:28:07.436
How's your shoulder?

00:28:08.108 --> 00:28:09.254
It's fine.

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:10.851
You feel any pain?

00:28:11.659 --> 00:28:12.567
No.

00:28:13.045 --> 00:28:15.164
What if I gave it a big ol' punch?

00:28:15.584 --> 00:28:17.510
Would you--would you feel any pain then?

00:28:18.754 --> 00:28:19.744
Maybe.

00:28:19.838 --> 00:28:21.662
Listen, just go out there.

00:28:21.663 --> 00:28:22.882
Just give it your best.

00:28:22.883 --> 00:28:26.016
If you feel any pain, just...

00:28:26.268 --> 00:28:29.373
Just..keep...playing?

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.758
That's my boy.

00:28:44.709 --> 00:28:45.930
Please let this be okay.

00:28:46.867 --> 00:28:48.049
Please.

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:49.222
Hey, kid.

00:28:49.223 --> 00:28:50.108
Hey.

00:28:50.355 --> 00:28:52.476
So, you think you'll see
any action tonight?

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.896
Action?

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:55.996
Maybe.

00:28:58.339 --> 00:28:59.027
Down!

00:28:59.231 --> 00:29:00.358
Please.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:01.365
Set!

00:29:38.304 --> 00:29:39.664
That's it, Jackson!

00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:40.896
Get fired up!

00:29:40.897 --> 00:29:42.150
Fired up!

00:30:03.156 --> 00:30:04.126
Brutal.

00:30:07.166 --> 00:30:08.825
Oh, this is not gonna be good.

00:30:09.333 --> 00:30:10.254
Only to me.

00:30:10.255 --> 00:30:11.532
But what if he's open?

00:30:11.533 --> 00:30:13.255
Who's the captain, you or me?

00:30:13.256 --> 00:30:13.888
Jackson, come on,

00:30:13.889 --> 00:30:15.064
dude, I just wanna win.

00:30:15.065 --> 00:30:15.856
We will win.

00:30:15.857 --> 00:30:16.373
But--

00:30:16.374 --> 00:30:17.709
What did I say? Huh?

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.211
What...did...I say?

00:30:21.287 --> 00:30:22.835
Don't pass to McCall.

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:40.102
You okay, kid?

00:30:55.239 --> 00:30:56.311
Which one is Scott again?

00:30:56.312 --> 00:30:57.602
Number 11.

00:30:58.188 --> 00:30:59.373
Otherwise known as the only one

00:30:59.374 --> 00:31:00.344
who hasn't caught a single ball

00:31:00.345 --> 00:31:01.589
this entire game.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.803
I hope he's okay.

00:31:02.993 --> 00:31:04.331
I hope we're okay.

00:31:05.938 --> 00:31:07.221
We need to win this.

00:31:09.837 --> 00:31:10.774
Allison.

00:31:11.295 --> 00:31:12.417
You'll help me?

00:31:26.871 --> 00:31:27.797
Down!

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.261
Set!

00:31:56.756 --> 00:31:58.331
Yeah!

00:31:58.572 --> 00:32:00.391
Yes! That's what I--

00:32:00.392 --> 00:32:01.953
What? What?

00:32:08.707 --> 00:32:09.824
McCall!

00:32:09.825 --> 00:32:11.784
Pass to McCall!

00:32:14.314 --> 00:32:15.228
Set!

00:32:28.064 --> 00:32:28.994
Did the opposing team just

00:32:28.995 --> 00:32:31.673
deliberately pass us the ball?

00:32:31.674 --> 00:32:33.285
Yes, I believe so, coach.

00:32:37.384 --> 00:32:38.635
Interesting.

00:32:43.593 --> 00:32:44.691
Goal!

00:32:46.023 --> 00:32:47.606
Yes! Yes!

00:32:47.607 --> 00:32:48.469
There you go!

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.401
Wha...

00:32:55.497 --> 00:32:56.900
Way to go, McCall!

00:32:56.932 --> 00:32:58.518
What? The ball's in the net.

00:32:58.519 --> 00:32:59.081
Ball's in the net.

00:32:59.082 --> 00:32:59.851
That's the goal of the game,

00:32:59.852 --> 00:33:01.200
is get the ball in the net!

00:33:01.201 --> 00:33:02.205
We got it.

00:33:07.249 --> 00:33:08.231
Down!

00:33:08.273 --> 00:33:09.023
Hey, what the hell's up with

00:33:09.024 --> 00:33:09.662
your teammate, man?

00:33:09.663 --> 00:33:10.759
What's he on?

00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:12.243
I don't know.

00:33:13.464 --> 00:33:14.440
Yet.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.541
Set!

00:33:32.735 --> 00:33:34.149
Scott, no, no.

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:38.647
Come on, come on.

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:40.989
You can do it, Scott.

00:33:41.742 --> 00:33:42.906
You can do it, Scott.

00:34:03.108 --> 00:34:05.682
Yes! Ha!

00:34:05.782 --> 00:34:07.133
Oh, my God.

00:34:36.417 --> 00:34:37.613
Dad, what's wrong?

00:35:10.958 --> 00:35:11.926
Scott?

00:35:15.423 --> 00:35:16.563
Scott, are you here?

00:36:04.866 --> 00:36:05.873
Scott?

00:36:28.227 --> 00:36:29.147
Scott?

00:36:41.062 --> 00:36:42.640
Hey, are you okay?

00:36:42.827 --> 00:36:43.784
Scott.

00:36:44.609 --> 00:36:45.119
You scared me.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.315
Are you all right?

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:49.016
Yeah.

00:36:49.735 --> 00:36:51.207
Sorry, I...

00:36:51.944 --> 00:36:54.077
Just got kind of lightheaded for a sec.

00:36:54.657 --> 00:36:56.339
Maybe it's the adrenaline.

00:36:56.956 --> 00:36:58.756
You were pretty amazing out there.

00:37:01.506 --> 00:37:03.352
I'm sorry for acting really weird today.

00:37:03.636 --> 00:37:04.754
It's okay.

00:37:05.164 --> 00:37:06.591
I can handle weird.

00:37:09.278 --> 00:37:11.089
To be totally honest, you,

00:37:12.582 --> 00:37:14.725
uh...make me kind of nervous.

00:37:15.201 --> 00:37:16.139
I do?

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.472
Yeah, kind of like really nervous.

00:37:20.475 --> 00:37:21.782
I just--I...

00:37:22.724 --> 00:37:24.650
Want to make sure I get my second chance.

00:37:27.133 --> 00:37:28.382
You already have it.

00:37:30.231 --> 00:37:31.823
I'm just waiting for you to take it.

00:37:37.482 --> 00:37:42.336
Well...maybe I need to learn
to take more chances.

00:37:43.046 --> 00:37:44.223
Maybe you do.

00:38:22.764 --> 00:38:24.380
I gotta get back to my dad.

00:38:32.722 --> 00:38:33.820
Stiles.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.232
Hey, yeah.

00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:45.442
I kissed her.

00:38:45.443 --> 00:38:46.755
I saw.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.360
She kissed me.

00:38:48.361 --> 00:38:49.599
Saw that too.

00:38:52.122 --> 00:38:53.414
That's pretty good, huh?

00:38:56.139 --> 00:38:58.134
I-I-I don't know how,

00:38:58.364 --> 00:38:59.837
but I controlled it.

00:39:00.384 --> 00:39:01.801
I pulled it back.

00:39:03.334 --> 00:39:04.335
Maybe I can do this.

00:39:04.336 --> 00:39:05.970
Maybe it's not that bad.

00:39:06.053 --> 00:39:07.623
Yeah, heh.

00:39:08.312 --> 00:39:09.511
We'll talk later, then.

00:39:11.204 --> 00:39:12.233
What?

00:39:14.606 --> 00:39:18.266
The, uh, medical examiner looked at
the other half of the body we found.

00:39:18.566 --> 00:39:19.671
And...

00:39:19.806 --> 00:39:21.176
Well, I'll keep it simple.

00:39:21.177 --> 00:39:24.710
Medical examiner determines killer
of girl to be animal, not human.

00:39:24.711 --> 00:39:26.610
Derek's human, not animal.

00:39:26.742 --> 00:39:28.504
Derek not killer.

00:39:28.876 --> 00:39:30.485
Derek let out of jail.

00:39:30.748 --> 00:39:31.585
Are you kidding?

00:39:31.586 --> 00:39:33.365
No, and here's a bigger kick in the ass.

00:39:33.366 --> 00:39:35.077
My dad I.D.'d the dead girl.

00:39:35.078 --> 00:39:36.336
Both halves.

00:39:37.236 --> 00:39:38.667
Her name was Laura Hale.

00:39:40.752 --> 00:39:41.812
Hale?

00:39:42.412 --> 00:39:43.697
Derek's sister.

00:39:43.897 --> 00:39:54.097
