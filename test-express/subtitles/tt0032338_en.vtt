WEBVTT

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.667
...into a big airy bedroom.

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:17.327
Then the sideboard turns around
and turns into the bathroom.

00:01:17.427 --> 00:01:19.485
- So you can eat and bathe?
- Course not.

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:23.726
- Then what's it doing in the bathroom?
- Nothing. It turns into a bathroom.

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:26.284
Then another time it turns into a kitchenette.

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:28.808
Another time into a fireplace.

00:01:28.908 --> 00:01:31.088
You can't light it but it looks awful cute.

00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:34.087
- What turns into a fireplace?
- This gig in the corner.

00:01:34.187 --> 00:01:36.970
It turns around and makes one room
into four rooms

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.728
so young people who haven't much money
can have a four-room apartment

00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:42.886
for the price of a one-room apartment.

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:45.691
- One room isn't an apartment.
- They're called that.

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:48.166
- It's the same as four rooms.
- But suppose I...

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:51.849
- You turn this in the corner...
- Suppose I wanted to go to the fireplace

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:53.688
while you were in the kitchenette.

00:01:53.788 --> 00:01:56.007
You're trying to make things difficult.

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:59.530
Nothing's good enough for you
except a palace on Fifth Avenue.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.651
<i>I give you coffee</i> -
<i>the end of the perfect dinner,</i>

00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:05.177
<i>the beginning of the perfect day.</i>

00:02:17.463 --> 00:02:20.253
And now, the moment
we have all been waiting for.

00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:22.531
We are about to give you the result

00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:25.892
of the $50,000
Maxford House New Slogan contest,

00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:28.853
with a first prize of $25,000,

00:02:28.953 --> 00:02:30.849
a second prize of $5,000,

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.531
a third prize of $2,500,

00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:36.211
a fourth prize of $1,500,

00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:38.450
a fifth prize of $1,000,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.814
and 95 other prizes totalling $15,000.

00:02:42.914 --> 00:02:45.774
<i>Some folks are going to be delirious</i>
<i>in a few minutes.</i>

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.132
As you may well imagine,

00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:50.609
all that sugar draws a lot of flies

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.054
and the jury here has been struggling
to pick the winners

00:02:54.154 --> 00:03:00.852
from a little snowdrift of 2,947,582 answers.

00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:05.417
That is a lot of answers in any language,
including the Scandinavian.

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:11.382
Dr Maxford, our founder and president,
is at my side.

00:03:17.027 --> 00:03:19.577
It will only be a matter of a few moments

00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:23.573
until the jury ceases wrestling
and hands Dr Maxford the verdict,

00:03:23.673 --> 00:03:27.174
and he will himself,
in that well-known voice of his,

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:29.259
read you the names of the winners.

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:34.292
We seem to have a little contretemps,

00:03:34.392 --> 00:03:36.975
fox pass or what have you,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:03:37.075 --> 00:03:38.654
But it will only be...

00:03:38.754 --> 00:03:41.095
- What's the matter?
- The jury is deadlocked!

00:03:41.195 --> 00:03:43.535
- Deadlocked?
- Eleven to one!

00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:47.216
It will only be a few moments
before the jury untangles itself,

00:03:47.316 --> 00:03:51.063
and we will hear the happy winners' names
throughout the world.

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:02.139
Ahem. Just a little patience,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.538
- Can't you get it through...
- What's this about a deadlock?

00:04:14.638 --> 00:04:16.897
- Where's the verdict?
- Ask Bildocker.

00:04:16.997 --> 00:04:20.658
And you'll get an answer, too.
If you birds had the brains of a rooster...

00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:25.498
I resent that. You may know about shipping
but when eleven of us have agreed...

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.939
- It'll be ten o'clock next week...
- Quiet!

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.858
...before I give in to bunch of fat-headed,
mealy-mouthed lame brains who...

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.821
Quiet! Jumping Jehoshaphat!

00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:39.259
Do you realise that we're on the air?

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:42.061
The whole of America's
waiting for your verdict!

00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.457
120 million people
are suspended from your lips.

00:04:45.557 --> 00:04:48.538
You're giving heart failure
to the western hemisphere.

00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:51.298
What do you know about
picking slogans anyway?

00:04:51.398 --> 00:04:54.538
You wouldn't know a slogan
if you slipped on one.

00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:57.778
If you gentlemen had the combined brains
of an amoeba...

00:04:57.878 --> 00:05:00.018
But we're all agreed, Dr Maxford.

00:05:00.118 --> 00:05:02.061
It's only Bildocker who's holding out.

00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:07.699
Oh, it is, is it? Well, let me
tell you something, Mr Bildocker.

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:11.259
You've been getting into my hair
for the past 20 years,

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:13.462
and I meant to mention it before.

00:05:13.562 --> 00:05:15.938
I'm going to give you four seconds...

00:05:16.038 --> 00:05:17.700
No, you're not, Dr Maxford.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.179
I'm a member of this jury and I'm going
to vote the way I think is right

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.418
if it takes ten years.

00:05:22.518 --> 00:05:24.542
You can fire me out of shipping

00:05:24.642 --> 00:05:29.063
but you aren't going to fire me off this jury
because I don't work for you on this jury.

00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:31.901
I'm giving my services free to the bunch of...

00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:34.545
Who said anything about firing you,
you lunkhead?

00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:37.388
All I said was that I...

00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:43.630
Yes? Oh, we are, are we?

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:47.030
Well, that's just lovely.

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:51.421
We're going off the air, gentlemen,
so just take your time.

00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:53.703
You can stay here till next Wednesday.

00:05:53.803 --> 00:05:56.702
Or you can still here
till Hoboken freezes over.

00:05:56.802 --> 00:05:59.585
We have failed in our promise to the public.

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:03.626
We have muffed the most dramatic
advertising moment in commerce,

00:06:03.726 --> 00:06:06.021
and you've made a fathead out of me.

00:06:06.121 --> 00:06:10.146
The next nitwit who talks to me
about a contest

00:06:10.246 --> 00:06:12.751
had better duck before I swing on him.

00:06:16.557 --> 00:06:20.305
In conclusion, gentlemen,
especially you, Mr Bildocker,

00:06:20.405 --> 00:06:25.597
let me say that I have seen
far better heads on... umbrellas!

00:06:27.398 --> 00:06:30.746
And so,
another broadcast slips into posterity,

00:06:30.846 --> 00:06:35.624
as we bring to a close
the 449th Maxford House programme.

00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:38.625
I wish I could have given you
the news you wanted to hear.

00:06:38.725 --> 00:06:41.668
But I will conclude with
what the prisoner said

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:43.787
when the hangman couldn't find the rope.

00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:47.503
"No noose is good noose." Ha, ha.

00:06:47.603 --> 00:06:50.750
This is Don Hartman,
wishing you all goodnight.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.867
They build you up to a big finish
and leave you hanging on a meat hook.

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:01.510
You heard what he said.
No news is good news.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.187
- He said, "No noose is good noose."
- So?

00:07:04.287 --> 00:07:07.585
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I wish they'd get it over with.

00:07:07.685 --> 00:07:11.827
You start thinking about that $25,000,
or even the $5,000...

00:07:11.927 --> 00:07:13.587
- Or anything.
- You said it.

00:07:13.687 --> 00:07:17.870
When you've got it right in your mitts,
they leave you with your tongue hanging out.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.909
There ought to be a law against it.

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.828
- Did you really think you'd win it?
- I haven't lost it yet.

00:07:23.928 --> 00:07:26.146
- How many have you lost?
- I don't know.

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:30.111
But every time I've lost a contest,
I've doubled my chances on the next one.

00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:34.587
It's the law of averages. Like when I lost the
How Many Peanuts In The Window contest.

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:37.950
- That doubled my chances...
- They put boxes under the peanuts.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.187
They didn't ask how many boxes
under the peanuts. They said...

00:07:41.287 --> 00:07:43.790
- "How many peanuts are in the window?"
- So I lost.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.390
That doubled my chances on the
You Fill In The Missing Words contest.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.468
- But you lost that one too.
- Fine.

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:53.310
- I was eight to one in the limerick contest.
- But you didn't win it, Jimmy!

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.351
That's what makes it a cinch this time.

00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:57.348
Can't you see it over there in lights?

00:07:57.448 --> 00:07:59.668
The guy swallows his coffee, and it says,

00:07:59.768 --> 00:08:03.873
"If you don't sleep at night,
it isn't the coffee, it's the bunk."

00:08:03.973 --> 00:08:06.833
- That's some slogan.
- Mm-hm.

00:08:06.933 --> 00:08:09.590
Do you get the point?
Do you understand what it means?

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.589
- Yes...
- What do you mean, yes?

00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:15.518
It's clear as crystal.
"It isn't the coffee, it's the bunk."

00:08:16.844 --> 00:08:21.353
If you don't sleep at night, it isn't the coffee
that keeps you awake, it's the bunk.

00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:25.511
- The bunk when you don't sleep!
- I know! I've heard it a thousand times!

00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:28.431
- I just don't understand it.
- Maybe you don't try to.

00:08:28.531 --> 00:08:32.229
- Maybe I don't.
- A kid of two could understand that.

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:36.392
This Viennese doctor says
that whole idea's just a superstition,

00:08:36.492 --> 00:08:39.594
that instead of keeping you awake,
coffee makes you sleep.

00:08:39.694 --> 00:08:43.310
- It's simple. Coffee makes you sleep.
- It doesn't make me sleep.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.514
- He's a Viennese doctor!
- Coffee keeps you awake!

00:08:46.614 --> 00:08:50.752
Why are you so pig-headed about it?
I'm not trying to contradict you...

00:08:50.852 --> 00:08:54.275
It's the new scientific theory.
It's the basis of my slogan.

00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:58.114
People who think coffee keeps them awake
are nervous wrecks anyway

00:08:58.214 --> 00:08:59.756
so why blame it on the coffee?

00:08:59.856 --> 00:09:04.632
So I say, "If you don't sleep at night,
it isn't the coffee, it's the bunk."

00:09:04.732 --> 00:09:06.755
- Do you get it?
- I guess so.

00:09:06.855 --> 00:09:11.595
- You guess so. What does it mean?
- It's the bunk.

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:15.195
- Yes, but do you get the play on words?
- You don't need a play on words.

00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:19.397
Any time anybody says
coffee makes you sleep, it's bunk.

00:09:19.497 --> 00:09:22.873
Don't you understand? It's funny.
People are going to laugh.

00:09:22.973 --> 00:09:26.716
It means it isn't the coffee
that keeps you awake, it's the bed.

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:29.438
- With me it's the coffee.
- Oh...

00:09:29.538 --> 00:09:32.754
I want you to win it.
I'm just as anxious as you are.

00:09:32.854 --> 00:09:36.915
And when you lose this one, think how much
better your chances will be on the next.

00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:41.873
Fine chance I've got of winning anything
if everybody says coffee keeps you awake.

00:09:41.973 --> 00:09:45.477
Let's drink a gallon of coffee
and see who sleeps the longest.

00:09:45.577 --> 00:09:47.715
- Oh, shut up.
- Jimmy!

00:09:47.815 --> 00:09:49.010
Jimmy!

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.316
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:56.597
Mr Zimmerman says
will you not talk so loud?

00:09:56.697 --> 00:10:00.395
- He's trying to go to sleep.
- Tell him to drink a cup of coffee.

00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:03.280
And don't take cold up there.
Is Betty warm enough?

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.080
- Yes, thank you, Mrs MacDonald.
- All right, dear.

00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:13.237
I'd like you just as much
if you didn't win the old contest.

00:10:13.337 --> 00:10:15.635
- That's because you're a sap.
- Maybe I am.

00:10:15.735 --> 00:10:19.080
But if I am I'm glad of it.
You know how we feel about each other.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.317
- Nix.
- It's true, isn't it?

00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:24.404
- You can't say I'm being forward.
- Not much.

00:10:25.412 --> 00:10:29.441
I'm not. Time is slipping by
and we're not getting any younger.

00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:30.541
Nix.

00:10:31.212 --> 00:10:33.037
Two can live as cheaply as one.

00:10:33.137 --> 00:10:35.931
Who wants to live cheaply?
Cut it out, will you?

00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:41.239
What would you do if you won the $25,000?

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.238
Stick it in the bank.

00:10:43.338 --> 00:10:45.920
Wouldn't you even buy a little ring
or something?

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.679
- I don't like rings on a man.
- Oh, you.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:53.080
What's the use of talking about it?
You know I'd spend it on you and mum.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.883
I'd get you a new shiny car
and a swell apartment.

00:10:55.983 --> 00:11:00.280
Maybe one of those little dream houses
in the suburbs, some hired help.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.483
Maybe a trip to Europe. Maybe the Grand
Canyon would be better nowadays.

00:11:04.583 --> 00:11:07.320
- We'd be happy all right.
- We could be happy anyway.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.204
Everything that means happiness
costs money.

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:13.084
How much was your dad making
when he married your mom?

00:11:13.184 --> 00:11:15.080
- 18 bucks a week.
- Well?

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.522
You think that proves something?

00:11:17.622 --> 00:11:20.244
She's never been to the country
for more than a day.

00:11:20.344 --> 00:11:22.203
Never had any nice furniture.

00:11:22.303 --> 00:11:27.123
The dream of her life is a Davenport that
turns into a double bed at night-time.

00:11:27.223 --> 00:11:30.601
She's never had a nice dress
except those she made herself.

00:11:30.701 --> 00:11:34.081
I wore the old man's stuff cut down
until I got my first job

00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:38.162
and he was worn out at 48 and croaked
because he couldn't afford a doctor.

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:40.204
Where do you get that $18 a week stuff?

00:11:40.304 --> 00:11:42.926
I earn $18 and you earn $22 and that's $40.

00:11:43.026 --> 00:11:46.285
Sure and you've got your ma
and I've got mine.

00:11:46.385 --> 00:11:50.363
You get a kid and you have to stop work
and we're right back at the $22 again.

00:11:50.463 --> 00:11:54.161
Except then there's you and the kid
and the two old ladies and me.

00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:56.162
- But Jimmy...
- Nix, honey.

00:11:56.262 --> 00:11:58.721
They didn't give you
wrists and hands like that

00:11:58.821 --> 00:12:01.607
to spoil in a washtub for a poor sap like me.

00:12:01.707 --> 00:12:04.327
- But Jimmy...
- You gotta look out for yourself.

00:12:04.427 --> 00:12:08.202
You gotta see the main chance and grab it,
the chance of plenty of money.

00:12:08.302 --> 00:12:11.726
Men look out for themselves.
They think about nothing but money.

00:12:11.826 --> 00:12:16.806
A girl's got to do the same instead of
fooling away her time on a guy like me.

00:12:16.906 --> 00:12:20.124
- Unless he crashes through.
- You make me tired.

00:12:20.224 --> 00:12:22.646
- Then go to bed.
- That's a nice thing to say.

00:12:22.746 --> 00:12:24.405
Invite a girl over and yell at her.

00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:28.166
If I wanted to be insulted, I could have gone
out with the credit manager.

00:12:28.266 --> 00:12:31.005
- Who's stopping you?
- Thank you, Mr MacDonald.

00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:34.086
- It's nice to know where you stand.
- I'm sorry.

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:38.458
Maybe I will go out with the credit manager.
Good night.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.898
- Wait and I'll help you.
- I don't need any help.

00:12:51.381 --> 00:12:52.381
Here.

00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:01.089
- Kindly let go of my arm.
- Why don't you watch your step?

00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:03.847
- Why don't you mind your own business?
- Oh, shut up.

00:13:03.947 --> 00:13:07.172
- Why don't you shut up?
- Why don't you both shut up?

00:13:08.062 --> 00:13:09.062
See?

00:13:27.143 --> 00:13:29.447
They got up there a horse yet?

00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:32.376
- Wait for your laugh.
- Wise guy.

00:13:39.463 --> 00:13:42.217
- Bread and butter.
- Bread and butter.

00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:03.374
- Don't fall down the ladder.
- I've been down it before.

00:14:03.474 --> 00:14:05.769
You fell down it before too.

00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:08.212
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:14:08.312 --> 00:14:12.089
- See you at the office.
- Aren't you going to take me?

00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:14.185
All right.

00:14:14.745 --> 00:14:17.492
- Good night, Jimmy.
- Good night.

00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:19.702
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:14:20.946 --> 00:14:22.146
Night.

00:14:25.226 --> 00:14:27.581
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, darling.

00:14:35.227 --> 00:14:37.494
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:39.623
Good night!

00:14:41.067 --> 00:14:44.532
- I tell you, it makes you sleep.
- OK, it makes you sleep.

00:14:44.632 --> 00:14:47.932
And water runs uphill
and dogs miaow and cats bark

00:14:48.032 --> 00:14:52.855
and water's red-hot in the winter
and freezes over in the summer.

00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:55.412
You're a dreamer. Just like your father.

00:14:55.512 --> 00:14:57.333
With him it was always automobiles

00:14:57.433 --> 00:14:59.573
where the wind, it scooped it up in the front

00:14:59.673 --> 00:15:02.218
and pushed out the back to make it go,
or some such.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.373
There's no wind blowing out of my ideas.

00:15:04.473 --> 00:15:08.257
- Pretty windy. Have you got car fare?
- Think so.

00:15:09.469 --> 00:15:10.469
Yeah.

00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:15.658
Make a wish.
What falls to the floor comes to the door.

00:15:15.758 --> 00:15:18.213
- All right.
- There's nothing to laugh about.

00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:21.337
I mind the time your father,
may his soul be peaceful,

00:15:21.437 --> 00:15:23.058
dropped a quarter down a crack,

00:15:23.158 --> 00:15:27.056
and it wasn't an hour till a near-sighted man
gave him a five-dollar gold piece

00:15:27.156 --> 00:15:29.186
instead of a nickel in paying his fare.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.176
- We went to Coney that night.
- What was wrong with Pa's eyes?

00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:35.175
He was looking somewhere else.

00:15:35.275 --> 00:15:37.857
There was nothing the matter
with your father.

00:15:37.957 --> 00:15:40.095
He was a fine-looking conductor.

00:15:40.195 --> 00:15:42.256
- He was.
- You'd seem a shrimp beside him.

00:15:42.356 --> 00:15:44.735
- I would.
- Don't say anything against him.

00:15:44.835 --> 00:15:46.939
I'm not saying anything against him, Mum.

00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:49.545
Well, watch your step.

00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:52.856
- Jimmy.
- Yes'm?

00:15:52.956 --> 00:15:55.021
There's money in your cup.

00:16:16.153 --> 00:16:18.218
So the sucker says, "Is Mr Fish there?"

00:16:18.318 --> 00:16:21.942
And the guy says, "Which one do you want?
This is the New York Aquarium."

00:16:23.673 --> 00:16:27.021
The best one is, you say,
"This is the Edison Company.

00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:31.062
"Would you mind seeing if the street light's
burning in front of your house?"

00:16:31.162 --> 00:16:33.704
And when the poor mug says, "Yes, it is,"

00:16:33.804 --> 00:16:35.830
you say, "Well, blow it out, will you?"

00:16:37.474 --> 00:16:41.141
Hello, is this
the Maxford House Coffee Company?

00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:44.858
Could you tell me if the jury's reached
a verdict on the contest yet?

00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:48.940
They haven't? Then there's
still a chance for everybody, huh?

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.026
Thanks just the same.

00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:56.900
I wonder what one of those suckers
would do if they ever did win.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.944
Well, it's very easy to find out.

00:17:00.044 --> 00:17:03.659
All you need is a telegraph blank,
some scissors and some glue.

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:07.305
- Cut it in strips, do it on the blank.
- Holy mackerel.

00:18:07.079 --> 00:18:09.383
Good afternoon, Miss Casey.

00:18:09.483 --> 00:18:11.390
Good morning, Mr Waterbury.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.794
Good morning, John.

00:19:03.362 --> 00:19:05.992
Jams. It's been doing that quite a lot lately.

00:19:06.092 --> 00:19:09.787
- The wonder is it works at all.
- Yes, sir.

00:19:09.887 --> 00:19:12.920
Come into my office a moment,
Mr MacDonald.

00:19:13.883 --> 00:19:15.635
Yes, sir.

00:19:40.205 --> 00:19:42.994
I've been watching you for some time,
Mr MacDonald.

00:19:43.094 --> 00:19:45.599
Yes, sir. It used to make me kind of nervous.

00:19:46.725 --> 00:19:48.630
- Not nervous any more?
- No, sir.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.232
- Are you a drinking man, then?
- Sir?

00:19:51.332 --> 00:19:54.869
This is part of your yesterday's work.
I believe your number is 112?

00:19:54.969 --> 00:19:56.354
Yes, sir.

00:19:56.454 --> 00:19:59.474
The computing machine is almost foolproof,
Mr MacDonald,

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:04.473
yet you managed to miss your total by
a little matter of $11,000 on this one sheet.

00:20:04.573 --> 00:20:06.753
To what do you attribute that?

00:20:06.853 --> 00:20:09.512
I, er... I don't know, Mr Waterbury.

00:20:09.612 --> 00:20:12.033
You know simple arithmetic, don't you?

00:20:12.133 --> 00:20:17.071
You know the difference between addition,
subtraction and possibly multiplication?

00:20:17.171 --> 00:20:19.796
Yes, sir. I'm pretty good at it.

00:20:19.896 --> 00:20:23.916
Have you troubles at home? You
henpecked? Suffering from a broken heart?

00:20:24.016 --> 00:20:26.471
Had your teeth examined lately?

00:20:26.571 --> 00:20:29.952
Or are you purely and simply
incapable of doing your work?

00:20:30.052 --> 00:20:33.592
Well, I... I guess it's the contest,
Mr Waterbury,

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:35.317
the Maxford House contest.

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:37.595
I had no idea it was hurting my work.

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:41.557
- How much is the prize?
- The first prize is $25,000.

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:42.657
Yes.

00:20:43.488 --> 00:20:47.794
I used to think about $25,000 too,
and what I'd do with it.

00:20:47.894 --> 00:20:50.875
That I'd be a failure
if I didn't get a hold of it.

00:20:50.975 --> 00:20:57.515
And then one day I realised
I was never going to have $25,000.

00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:00.994
And then another day a little bit later,
considerably later,

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.197
I realised something else,

00:21:03.297 --> 00:21:07.239
something I'm imparting to you now,
Mr MacDonald.

00:21:07.339 --> 00:21:10.316
I'm not a failure. I'm a success.

00:21:10.416 --> 00:21:13.156
You see, ambition is all right if it works.

00:21:13.256 --> 00:21:17.034
But no system could be right where only
half of one per cent were successes

00:21:17.134 --> 00:21:19.158
and all the rest were failures.

00:21:19.258 --> 00:21:22.119
I'm not a failure. I'm a success.

00:21:22.219 --> 00:21:27.597
So are you if you earn your own living and
pay your bills and look the world in the eye.

00:21:27.697 --> 00:21:32.236
I hope you win your $25,000, Mr MacDonald.

00:21:32.336 --> 00:21:35.875
But if you shouldn't happen to,
don't worry about it.

00:21:35.975 --> 00:21:41.518
Now get the heck back to your desk
and try to improve your arithmetic.

00:21:41.618 --> 00:21:44.251
Yes, sir, Mr Waterbury.

00:21:45.732 --> 00:21:47.848
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

00:22:25.374 --> 00:22:28.200
Wow! Oh, honey, look!

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.164
Hey, everybody! Hey, everybody!
Come here?

00:22:32.264 --> 00:22:33.964
Get up here, honey.

00:22:34.064 --> 00:22:35.064
Wow!

00:22:36.015 --> 00:22:41.204
There comes a time in everybody's life
when he's got to get up and let it rip!

00:22:41.304 --> 00:22:43.961
Wow! In other words, boys and girls,

00:22:44.061 --> 00:22:47.411
I just won the $25,000 first prize
in the Maxford House contest.

00:22:49.976 --> 00:22:53.404
Hey, give me a phone.
Boy, this is gonna be good.

00:22:53.504 --> 00:22:57.933
Hello? Give me Astoria 59970.
This is really gonna be good.

00:23:02.896 --> 00:23:06.085
- Hello, is this Mrs Schwartz?
- Yes.

00:23:06.185 --> 00:23:08.242
This is Jimmy. Hello, Mrs Schwartz.

00:23:08.342 --> 00:23:11.562
I hate to bother you
but could I talk to my mom? It's important.

00:23:11.662 --> 00:23:14.729
Thank you. I'll let you use my phone
when I get one.

00:23:19.257 --> 00:23:21.162
Hello, Mum? This is Jimmy.

00:23:21.262 --> 00:23:24.244
I'm going to tell you something.
Don't be frightened.

00:23:24.344 --> 00:23:27.047
- You're not hurt?
- Course I'm not hurt!

00:23:27.147 --> 00:23:30.805
Mum, would I call you up
from under a streetcar?

00:23:30.905 --> 00:23:33.325
Mum, are you a rich woman
or a poor woman?

00:23:33.425 --> 00:23:36.606
No, I'm not crazy with the heat,
I'm just asking you a question.

00:23:36.706 --> 00:23:38.924
Are you a rich woman or a poor woman?

00:23:39.024 --> 00:23:42.207
You're all wet! I said you're all wet, Mum.

00:23:42.307 --> 00:23:45.886
Buy yourself anything you want.
Furniture, automobiles, dresses.

00:23:45.986 --> 00:23:47.927
- Electric washer.
- Electric washer!

00:23:48.027 --> 00:23:49.967
You know the one you like? It's yours.

00:23:50.067 --> 00:23:53.566
- The Davenport.
- The one that turns into a double bed.

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:58.205
It's yours, Mum. And anything else
you want. All you gotta do is tell me.

00:23:58.305 --> 00:24:02.169
- It's gonna cost you a Davenport.
- I'll tell the world I got a raise.

00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:04.767
- Wow, he got a raise!
- Put him out of his misery.

00:24:04.867 --> 00:24:07.888
- Hey, the boss.
- What is going on around here?

00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:11.168
What is this? A football game?

00:24:11.268 --> 00:24:15.327
Quiet! I said quiet!
Or there will be severe consequences.

00:24:15.427 --> 00:24:20.365
What are you doing on that desk?
Never mind! You're fired as of this minute.

00:24:20.465 --> 00:24:22.606
- What's your name?
- James MacDonald.

00:24:22.706 --> 00:24:24.447
This is my fiancée, Miss Casey.

00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:27.055
Well, let that be a lesson to you.

00:24:29.221 --> 00:24:32.367
What is so funny about that?

00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:35.368
What is the meaning of this demonstration,
Mr Waterbury?

00:24:35.468 --> 00:24:38.208
I demand an explanation,
and it had better be good.

00:24:38.308 --> 00:24:40.809
It is very good, sir. It appears this lad...

00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:43.286
What? What? What?

00:24:43.386 --> 00:24:44.582
Quiet!

00:24:45.222 --> 00:24:47.288
- Mr Baxter.
- What do you want?

00:24:47.388 --> 00:24:49.767
If anyone ought to be fired, it's me.

00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:53.211
Never mind the noble gestures.
I'll decide what's what.

00:24:53.311 --> 00:24:55.687
Save that Rover Boy stuff
for your spare time.

00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:59.248
See that this young man is paid off,
and don't let this reoccur.

00:24:59.348 --> 00:25:01.248
There's a very good reason...

00:25:01.348 --> 00:25:04.009
- Has it anything to do with this company?
- No, but...

00:25:04.109 --> 00:25:07.851
- Then I don't care to hear about it!
- But you do care to hear about it.

00:25:07.951 --> 00:25:10.733
- How was that?
- I say you do care to hear about it.

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:13.374
You couldn't have understood
what was said.

00:25:13.474 --> 00:25:15.731
These children are part of your family.

00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:18.331
Anything that happens to them
happens to you.

00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:21.650
So if you don't care to hear,
you must have misunderstood.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.374
What is all this?

00:25:23.474 --> 00:25:25.849
This young man,
this minor employee of yours,

00:25:25.949 --> 00:25:29.931
has just won the $25,000
Maxford House New Slogan contest.

00:25:30.031 --> 00:25:34.373
He and he alone was chosen winner
over millions of contestants.

00:25:34.473 --> 00:25:37.893
And I say that is reason enough
for rejoicing.

00:25:37.993 --> 00:25:40.500
Well, I should say it is.

00:25:42.506 --> 00:25:47.732
If you'll kindly get down off my furniture,
I'd like to congratulate you, Mr...

00:25:47.832 --> 00:25:49.026
Jimmy.

00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:56.216
- Well, more power to you.
- Thank you, sir.

00:25:56.316 --> 00:25:59.293
I suppose I'll have to hire you back
on a fat increase.

00:25:59.393 --> 00:26:02.213
I don't think that will be necessary,
Mr Baxter.

00:26:02.313 --> 00:26:06.937
I've always liked it here and...
Oh, I guess a raise would come in handy.

00:26:08.587 --> 00:26:11.333
And you really won
the Maxford House contest, eh?

00:26:11.433 --> 00:26:14.653
- That's what the telegram said.
- They wanted a new slogan?

00:26:14.753 --> 00:26:17.494
- Yes, sir.
- It's about time they changed the old one.

00:26:17.594 --> 00:26:20.414
What was your slogan?

00:26:20.514 --> 00:26:24.052
"If you don't sleep at nights,
it isn't the coffee, it's the bunk."

00:26:24.152 --> 00:26:28.454
Do you get it? It's a play on words.
It means if you don't sleep at night...

00:26:28.554 --> 00:26:31.535
- But coffee keeps you awake.
- No, no, no, sir.

00:26:31.635 --> 00:26:34.897
- This scientist...
- It's a clever idea just the same.

00:26:34.997 --> 00:26:38.374
It isn't the coffee, it's the bunk.

00:26:38.474 --> 00:26:41.737
That ought to be good
for the whole industry.

00:26:41.837 --> 00:26:44.618
Did you get any ideas for Baxter and Sons

00:26:44.718 --> 00:26:47.376
while you were inventing slogans
for competitors?

00:26:47.476 --> 00:26:51.254
- We make coffee too, you know.
- I certainly did, Mr Baxter.

00:26:51.354 --> 00:26:54.778
I've been trying to tell them
to the advertising department.

00:26:54.878 --> 00:26:57.856
I've been down there
about a thousand times.

00:26:57.956 --> 00:27:00.579
You see, we don't advertise enough.

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:04.258
How would you like
to come and tell me a few of these ideas?

00:27:04.358 --> 00:27:06.299
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, Jimmy.

00:27:06.399 --> 00:27:08.616
You can come too, my dear.

00:27:08.716 --> 00:27:13.139
Then I'd put out a secondary brand
to catch the in-between trade.

00:27:13.239 --> 00:27:16.775
Say, uh... "Waterbury's. It's the berries."

00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:19.937
- What do you mean, Waterbury...
- Let him go on.

00:27:20.037 --> 00:27:23.497
Because if Baxter's is the best,
we've got to charge more for it.

00:27:23.597 --> 00:27:27.419
We've got to have a slogan. Word of mouth
is OK if you've got the right words.

00:27:27.519 --> 00:27:29.300
Make a note of that, Miss Pettypass.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.378
I tried to find a slogan that implied
that Baxters was the finest of its class.

00:27:33.478 --> 00:27:37.501
Say... Not "The aristocrat of coffee".
That's been used too much.

00:27:37.601 --> 00:27:40.621
But, er... say, er...

00:27:40.721 --> 00:27:44.178
"The blue-blood coffee.
It's bred in the bean."

00:27:44.278 --> 00:27:48.302
See? As if every bean
in our coffee had a pedigree.

00:27:48.402 --> 00:27:51.379
"Baxter's Best. The blueblood coffee."

00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:56.221
- "It's bred in the bean."
- "It's bred in the bean."

00:27:56.321 --> 00:27:59.342
Wonderful. How about that one?

00:27:59.442 --> 00:28:02.303
The only trouble with it is
I didn't think of it myself.

00:28:02.403 --> 00:28:05.901
"It's bred in the bean."
I can see it all over the nation.

00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:08.660
In every nook and dell.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.660
Jimmy, you're a genius.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.864
Now that you're a capitalist, I don't know
how you feel about working for a living,

00:28:15.964 --> 00:28:17.940
but if you'd care to have an office...

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.701
- You mean to myself?
- With his name on the door?

00:28:20.801 --> 00:28:24.664
Naturally. And this young lady
as your secretary.

00:28:24.764 --> 00:28:28.459
And a reasonable stipend
to be determined upon later.

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:31.664
I see no reason
why we shouldn't shake hands on it now.

00:28:31.764 --> 00:28:34.545
- Go ahead, Jimmy.
- Gee whizz, Mr Baxter.

00:28:34.645 --> 00:28:36.861
I should say I would, and how I would!

00:28:36.961 --> 00:28:40.905
I suppose you'd like to have the afternoon off
while we get your office ready?

00:28:41.005 --> 00:28:43.625
I'd certainly appreciate it, Mr Baxter.

00:28:43.725 --> 00:28:46.346
- Can she come along too?
- Why of course she can!

00:28:46.446 --> 00:28:51.461
And a little bird tells me what kind of store
you're going to be visiting first.

00:28:51.561 --> 00:28:55.666
A little jewellery store, I'll wager, eh?

00:28:55.766 --> 00:28:57.785
I guess you're not far wrong.

00:28:57.885 --> 00:29:01.342
But first I think I'll go to Maxford House
and pick up that cheque.

00:29:01.442 --> 00:29:04.307
Oh, yes. We'd almost forgotten about that,
hadn't we?

00:29:04.407 --> 00:29:06.223
Almost but not quite.

00:29:06.323 --> 00:29:08.905
What was your Maxford House
slogan again?

00:29:09.005 --> 00:29:11.026
"It isn't the bunk, it's the coffee."

00:29:11.126 --> 00:29:13.545
No, no! "It isn't the coffee, it's the bunk."

00:29:13.645 --> 00:29:16.022
Isn't that marvellous?

00:29:16.122 --> 00:29:19.423
"If you don't sleep at night it isn't the, uh..."

00:29:19.523 --> 00:29:22.707
Yes, but, "It's bred in the bean."

00:29:22.807 --> 00:29:25.306
- That's the one for my money.
- Functional.

00:29:25.406 --> 00:29:29.385
- Precisely.
- Well, Mr Baxter, I thank you.

00:29:29.485 --> 00:29:32.587
I don't know what to say.

00:29:32.687 --> 00:29:35.824
Thank you, Mr Jenkins.
It'll be a pleasure working with you.

00:29:35.924 --> 00:29:38.906
Thank you, Mr Waterbury,
and thank you, Mr Babcock,

00:29:39.006 --> 00:29:41.709
and thank you, Miss Pettypass and...

00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:43.349
And how.

00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:45.585
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:29:45.685 --> 00:29:48.148
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.346
- A big future.
- Immense.

00:29:54.446 --> 00:29:57.990
- I've had my eye on him for some time.
- Huh?

00:30:17.362 --> 00:30:19.507
- Look, kid...
- What?

00:30:19.607 --> 00:30:21.390
Can I talk to you? It's important.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.751
Can you tell me tomorrow? I've got to go
to the Maxford House and get my cheque.

00:30:25.851 --> 00:30:29.749
That's what I want to talk about.
Harry and Dick and I... Well...

00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:32.589
- Well, what?
- It's like this. You see, we...

00:30:32.689 --> 00:30:34.588
- Oh, MacDonald.
- Yes, sir?

00:30:34.688 --> 00:30:38.307
Was that "It's bred in the bean,"
or just plain "Bred in the bean"?

00:30:38.407 --> 00:30:42.432
"It's." Just "Bred in the bean" might
sound like bread, like bread and butter.

00:30:42.532 --> 00:30:45.792
- Naturally. I don't know why I didn't realise.
- Is that all, sir?

00:30:45.892 --> 00:30:49.833
Yes. Have a nice time and
don't spend all your money in one place.

00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:53.671
- Thank you, sir. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:55.964
Great mind.

00:30:56.484 --> 00:30:59.912
Did you wish to speak to me, Darcy?

00:31:00.012 --> 00:31:04.593
Who, me? Oh, no, sir.
I was just watching them go out.

00:31:04.693 --> 00:31:07.438
Well, it's been quite an exciting day,
hasn't it?

00:31:09.245 --> 00:31:12.237
Yeah, and it ain't even over yet.

00:31:15.285 --> 00:31:17.589
I said, "You can stay here
till Hoboken freezes over."

00:31:17.689 --> 00:31:20.911
- I should have fired all of them.
- I was mortified.

00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:24.790
The biggest moment in commercial annals
muffed by a gang of horse whistlers

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:28.074
who wouldn't know a slogan
from a poke in the eye with a stick.

00:31:28.174 --> 00:31:31.631
- I thought I'd die of embarrassment.
- I wish they'd died of lockjaw.

00:31:31.731 --> 00:31:33.791
What good are these contests, anyway?

00:31:33.891 --> 00:31:37.953
They disrupt the entire organisation,
they make you millions of enemies,

00:31:38.053 --> 00:31:41.155
and all they prove
is that you're making too much money,

00:31:41.255 --> 00:31:43.711
since you can afford
to toss it to some saphead

00:31:43.811 --> 00:31:47.192
who probably never had
a cup of your coffee but lives on goats' milk.

00:31:47.292 --> 00:31:50.432
- Have they reached a verdict yet?
- I don't know or care.

00:31:50.532 --> 00:31:52.752
If they hold off until our next broadcast...

00:31:52.852 --> 00:31:56.754
No, no!
That would be the intelligent thing to do.

00:31:56.854 --> 00:32:00.036
That would be useful to the company
that clothes and feeds them

00:32:00.136 --> 00:32:04.280
and sends their children to college
so they can be dumbbells like their parents.

00:32:08.128 --> 00:32:11.195
- What do you want?
- <i>The contest winner is here.</i>

00:32:11.295 --> 00:32:14.557
- The contest winner?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:32:14.657 --> 00:32:18.316
How do you like that? First they bottle up
the biggest scoop of the year,

00:32:18.416 --> 00:32:20.877
then when they get good and ready they...

00:32:22.569 --> 00:32:24.953
All right, send him in.

00:32:25.053 --> 00:32:26.715
- You can go in now.
- Thanks.

00:32:26.815 --> 00:32:29.360
- I guess I'd better wait here.
- Come on in.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.516
No, maybe you had better wait here.
We're a little excited.

00:32:32.616 --> 00:32:35.676
- You would be. Congratulations.
- Thanks. I mean, for him.

00:32:35.776 --> 00:32:37.638
For both of us.

00:32:37.738 --> 00:32:39.130
Well...

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.877
Of all the confounded...

00:32:41.977 --> 00:32:43.570
Come in!

00:32:46.371 --> 00:32:51.358
How do you do? I suppose I have the honour
of addressing Dr Maxford, I presume?

00:32:51.458 --> 00:32:53.798
Right. And this is Don Hartman,
my announcer.

00:32:53.898 --> 00:32:57.319
Well, Mr Hartman,
it certainly is a pleasure to meet you.

00:32:57.419 --> 00:32:59.636
I've enjoyed your personality on the air.

00:32:59.736 --> 00:33:01.877
- Congratulations to you.
- Thank you.

00:33:01.977 --> 00:33:04.399
Here's the telegram,
Mr Maxford... Dr Maxford.

00:33:04.499 --> 00:33:05.881
Yes, yes, yes.

00:33:05.981 --> 00:33:10.038
Oh, yes. "Great pleasure in informing you...
$25,000.

00:33:10.138 --> 00:33:12.319
"Kindly call and pick up your cheque."

00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:14.637
Bildocker has a great sense of the dramatic.

00:33:14.737 --> 00:33:17.398
You aren't by any chance a coffee drinker,
are you?

00:33:17.498 --> 00:33:20.239
- Yes, I certainly am.
- That's surprising.

00:33:20.339 --> 00:33:22.558
Do you, by any chance, drink my coffee?

00:33:22.658 --> 00:33:26.197
- No, sir, you see, I...
- Yes, that sounds more natural.

00:33:26.297 --> 00:33:29.162
- But I could easily change.
- That won't be necessary.

00:33:29.262 --> 00:33:33.442
I wouldn't want anybody to think
I had any base commercial motives.

00:33:33.542 --> 00:33:36.483
I just give money away
because I can't sleep at night.

00:33:36.583 --> 00:33:40.161
- I have a guilty conscience.
- That's my slogan. The one I won with.

00:33:40.261 --> 00:33:43.522
- I guess you know all about that.
- A guilty conscience, eh?

00:33:43.622 --> 00:33:47.121
I can see that my money is well spent.
That's a great slogan.

00:33:47.221 --> 00:33:51.120
No, sir. "If you can't sleep at night,
it isn't the coffee, it's the bunk."

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.200
- I beg your pardon?
- It's a pun.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.600
- It certainly is. It's great.
- Thank you.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.812
I can hardly wait to give you my money.

00:34:02.255 --> 00:34:03.724
Bring me that contest cheque.

00:34:03.824 --> 00:34:07.040
I don't know if you've ever had
anything like this happen to you,

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.920
but to be poor and unknown one minute
and on top of the world the next,

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.124
that's a feeling nobody can take from me.

00:34:13.224 --> 00:34:15.403
- Well, I...
- To know I won this contest

00:34:15.503 --> 00:34:20.004
because I thought up the best slogan
means more to me that anything on earth.

00:34:20.104 --> 00:34:21.762
- I'll tell you why.
- If you...

00:34:21.862 --> 00:34:25.523
I used to think maybe I had good ideas
and was gonna get somewhere,

00:34:25.623 --> 00:34:30.843
but now I know it, and that's what I want
to thank you for, more than the money.

00:34:30.943 --> 00:34:33.843
- Did you want the $25,000 one?
- That's right.

00:34:33.943 --> 00:34:38.482
- When they choose a winner?
- They didn't bother to inform me.

00:34:38.582 --> 00:34:41.446
James MacDonald. Is that Mac or Mc?

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:43.283
It's Mac, sir.

00:34:43.383 --> 00:34:46.523
My, uh... My grandmother was Scottish.

00:34:46.623 --> 00:34:49.002
Mine was Lithuanian.

00:34:49.102 --> 00:34:51.046
Here you are, young man.

00:34:51.146 --> 00:34:54.885
It is customary under these circumstances
to have photographers present,

00:34:54.985 --> 00:34:58.602
a couple of reporters and even newsreels
and broadcasting machinery.

00:34:58.702 --> 00:35:03.164
But since we do everything here
on a very high, non-commercial plain,

00:35:03.264 --> 00:35:07.565
I merely take pleasure in giving you
this small cheque, Mr MacDonald.

00:35:07.665 --> 00:35:11.124
- That's all there is to it.
- Thank you, Dr Maxford.

00:35:11.224 --> 00:35:14.487
- I don't know how I can find words...
- Never mind about them.

00:35:14.587 --> 00:35:17.368
Just goodbye and good luck.

00:35:17.468 --> 00:35:19.059
Oh, boy.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.448
- Now get me Bildocker!
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.500
Oh, gee!

00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:40.647
- She's a little bit excited.
- Yes.

00:35:40.747 --> 00:35:43.175
He's as cool as ice.

00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:47.886
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:35:47.986 --> 00:35:50.647
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:35:50.747 --> 00:35:52.341
Goodbye.

00:35:56.862 --> 00:35:59.928
- Yes?
- <i>Mr Bildocker isn't in his office.</i>

00:36:00.028 --> 00:36:04.051
Well, why not? Where is he?
Down in the lobby playing marble games?

00:36:04.151 --> 00:36:07.250
Find him and tell him...
Never mind. I'll tell him myself.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:10.062
"It isn't the coffee, it's the bunk"!

00:36:12.543 --> 00:36:15.449
Oh, isn't it beautiful, Jimmy?

00:36:15.549 --> 00:36:19.290
- Holy smoke, I should say it is.
- This is a trifle on the large side.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:23.050
Now, here is a stone
of more practical dimensions.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.969
Fiery little devil, isn't it?

00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:28.651
Does the magnifying glass go with it?

00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:32.012
It's up to you.
I was only trying to be helpful, that's all.

00:36:32.112 --> 00:36:34.770
It's immaterial to me
how big a ring you... look at.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.458
Now how about... Just a minute.

00:36:38.584 --> 00:36:40.575
Fresh guy.

00:36:41.784 --> 00:36:44.249
What do you think of this, for instance?

00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:47.011
- How much is it?
- $12,000.

00:36:47.111 --> 00:36:50.250
- I wouldn't care to spend that much.
- You wouldn't?

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.054
- No. But I could if I felt like it.
- You could?

00:36:53.154 --> 00:36:57.530
Oh. Well, that puts everything
on an entirely different basis.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:00.132
- Let me see.
- I'm in love with this one.

00:37:00.232 --> 00:37:02.610
Oh. Do you think it's showy enough?

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.335
- I wouldn't want it to be showy.
- Oh, yes.

00:37:05.435 --> 00:37:07.933
There's no denying
it's a friendly little piece.

00:37:08.033 --> 00:37:12.853
- Well, then, I guess we'll take it.
- Yes, sir.

00:37:12.953 --> 00:37:14.335
Oh, Jimmy!

00:37:14.435 --> 00:37:17.375
- I haven't got any cash with me but...
- Ah.

00:37:17.475 --> 00:37:20.495
- But I've got a cheque here.
- Uh-huh. May I see it, please?

00:37:20.595 --> 00:37:21.595
Sure.

00:37:26.427 --> 00:37:29.892
Well, well. Mr Schmidt!
Step this way immediately, please.

00:37:29.992 --> 00:37:32.451
- Well, well.
- I won the Maxford House contest.

00:37:32.551 --> 00:37:35.773
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Well, I should say it is.

00:37:35.873 --> 00:37:39.492
A thousand congratulations.
Uh... 25,000 congratulations.

00:37:39.592 --> 00:37:41.775
For heaven's sakes. Mr Schmidt!

00:37:41.875 --> 00:37:44.896
Yes, yes, Mr Hillbeiner,
I'll be there presently.

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:48.096
- Kindly cut a groove, will you?
- Sir.

00:37:48.196 --> 00:37:51.021
Hillbeiner has been drinking again.

00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:53.829
Yes?

00:37:55.629 --> 00:37:59.855
<i>Shindel Brothers wants to know</i>
<i>if that $25,000 cheque of yours is good.</i>

00:37:59.955 --> 00:38:04.255
Good? Tell them I'll match mine against
theirs any day and give them six to four.

00:38:04.355 --> 00:38:07.777
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Is it good?

00:38:07.877 --> 00:38:10.057
The Davenola. Now watch closely.

00:38:10.157 --> 00:38:14.339
I merely remove two cushions, place
my finger on the button marked "Night",

00:38:14.439 --> 00:38:16.697
and with one easy push of the finger,

00:38:16.797 --> 00:38:18.695
we have a double bed,

00:38:18.795 --> 00:38:22.979
a radio, an ashtray for those who smoke
in bed, a reading lamp for the reader,

00:38:23.079 --> 00:38:25.577
a telephone and many other accessories.

00:38:25.677 --> 00:38:29.380
Pausing merely to slip a pillow slip
over the day cushion...

00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:32.980
we complete the metamorphosis.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.860
Everything under fingertip control
throughout.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.580
There is no limit to man's ingenuity.

00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:43.510
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Comes the morrow.

00:38:45.992 --> 00:38:48.347
A flick of the wrist...

00:38:50.512 --> 00:38:52.503
a thorough airing...

00:39:00.033 --> 00:39:02.547
a gentle pressure
on the button marked "Day"...

00:39:03.793 --> 00:39:05.858
et voila, as the French would say,

00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:09.178
ready for breakfast, a rousing book
or a gentle game of bridge.

00:39:09.278 --> 00:39:11.902
The price, 198.50 plus tax.

00:39:12.002 --> 00:39:14.587
We'll take it.

00:39:16.393 --> 00:39:18.539
- What a bargain you're getting.
- Pardon?

00:39:18.639 --> 00:39:22.461
I'm Mr Shindel, Mr MacDonald.
Congratulations. Here's your cheque.

00:39:22.561 --> 00:39:25.503
- And what a cheque.
- Thanks. How soon can you send it?

00:39:25.603 --> 00:39:28.058
It's there. Make that a special, Hillbeiner.

00:39:28.158 --> 00:39:31.342
- Would your mother like one?
- No. We haven't got room.

00:39:31.442 --> 00:39:33.861
We got to get everybody something.

00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:36.100
Mama's been wanting a new iron.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.983
- She's got it.
- Have you got irons?

00:39:38.083 --> 00:39:41.024
Have we got irons? Huh!
They do everything but sing.

00:39:41.124 --> 00:39:43.861
We gotta get something for Mrs Schwartz,

00:39:43.961 --> 00:39:46.222
Sophie, Mrs Zimmerman, the Casey kids...

00:39:46.322 --> 00:39:48.540
Aren't you afraid of spending too much?

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.540
- The Finnegans.
- Patrolman Murphy.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.504
- Tony Mozepo.
- And Mr Rosenblatt.

00:39:52.604 --> 00:39:56.140
We better just work up
one side of the street and down the other.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.236
Oh, Jimmy!

00:40:08.597 --> 00:40:11.865
I don't like to take all this
without paying for it, Mr Shindel.

00:40:11.965 --> 00:40:15.102
Nonsense. We know an honest man
when we see one, don't we, boys?

00:40:15.202 --> 00:40:16.184
Indeed!

00:40:16.284 --> 00:40:19.026
Why don't you take this cheque
and give me the change?

00:40:19.126 --> 00:40:21.262
We should have change for such a cheque?

00:40:21.362 --> 00:40:23.305
Excuse me.

00:40:23.405 --> 00:40:25.665
- What a bargain.
- Thank you.

00:40:25.765 --> 00:40:28.664
I'll bring you a cheque
as soon as I put this in the bank.

00:40:28.764 --> 00:40:32.265
Who's in a hurry? Drop in any time.
Drop in tomorrow.

00:40:32.365 --> 00:40:34.945
- Here are the flowers.
- Thank you.

00:40:35.045 --> 00:40:38.146
A little souvenir.
Don't forget to call again, Mr MacDonald.

00:40:38.246 --> 00:40:40.542
- No, sir, I won't.
- Goodbye.

00:40:40.642 --> 00:40:42.595
Goodbye, Mr Shindel.

00:40:47.959 --> 00:40:52.068
- Goodbye, Mr Schmidt!
- Goodbye, Mr MacDonald.

00:40:52.168 --> 00:40:54.384
- Goodbye Mr Hillbeimer.
- Hillbeiner.

00:40:54.484 --> 00:40:57.827
- Goodbye Mr Heilbimmer.
- That's close enough. It's all right.

00:40:57.927 --> 00:41:01.986
- Come and see us again.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

00:41:02.086 --> 00:41:04.305
Have you got all your bundles now?

00:41:04.405 --> 00:41:06.000
Goodbye.

00:41:17.601 --> 00:41:20.069
- What a boy.
- What a business.

00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:24.949
- Oh, I'm so happy.
- I feel kind of good myself.

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:27.830
Can you see the faces on everybody
when we get there?

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.993
Yeah. Like Christmas in July.

00:41:34.282 --> 00:41:37.080
Well, happy New Year.

00:41:38.282 --> 00:41:40.991
It will be a happy new year from now on.

00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:44.307
Everything new and clean and different.

00:41:44.407 --> 00:41:48.708
- Just think, Jimmy. No more worry.
- That's right.

00:41:48.808 --> 00:41:51.789
That's the only terrible thing
about being poor.

00:41:51.889 --> 00:41:54.709
- What kind of a house will we have?
- Any kind you like.

00:41:54.809 --> 00:41:57.549
- How about a penthouse?
- They come high, don't they?

00:41:57.649 --> 00:42:00.555
No, I don't think... Oh, you fool!

00:42:04.043 --> 00:42:08.509
- Will you love me for always?
- Of course I will.

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:12.032
- For always and always?
- I don't know why not.

00:42:12.132 --> 00:42:14.391
It might be a long time.

00:42:14.491 --> 00:42:16.793
The longer the sweeter, baby.

00:42:18.044 --> 00:42:21.668
And then he says, "Mum, you're all wet.
You can buy anything you want.

00:42:21.768 --> 00:42:25.911
"An automobile, new dresses, furniture,
the Davenport, anything."

00:42:26.011 --> 00:42:29.549
My Irving, he drinks too.
Once in a while, a little bit.

00:42:29.649 --> 00:42:32.029
- Not so little.
- Yes, I know.

00:42:32.129 --> 00:42:35.952
But Jimmy doesn't. He wouldn't take a drink
unless something happened.

00:42:36.052 --> 00:42:38.595
- Maybe he lost his job.
- He said he got a raise.

00:42:38.695 --> 00:42:42.470
Who's giving raises these days?

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:44.363
I can't think what has happened.

00:42:46.846 --> 00:42:48.352
They're bringing him home.

00:42:48.452 --> 00:42:50.750
- Who asked you something?
- No...

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.512
Don't you worry. Maybe just a little accident.

00:42:53.612 --> 00:42:56.794
Maybe just a leg or a finger.

00:42:56.894 --> 00:42:59.720
Come here quick! Hurry up!

00:43:02.567 --> 00:43:05.240
- What is it?
- A funeral.

00:43:07.607 --> 00:43:10.433
Hey, Mum, come on down.
You too, Mrs Schwartz.

00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:13.635
- You too, Mama!
- We got presents for everybody!

00:43:13.735 --> 00:43:15.515
- He's drunk.
- Jimmy!

00:43:15.615 --> 00:43:18.072
I'm all right, Mum. Come on down.

00:43:18.172 --> 00:43:19.172
Look!

00:43:19.648 --> 00:43:23.766
- Was somebody hurt?
- Jimmy came home in a taxicab.

00:43:27.608 --> 00:43:31.275
I got a big surprise here.
I wanna start with Sophie.

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.325
Careful, now.

00:43:35.929 --> 00:43:38.356
- I've got a present for you, Sophie.
- For me?

00:43:38.456 --> 00:43:39.928
Yes. Open it up.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:53.930
Oh!

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:09.281
In a minute. Take it easy. Take it easy,
there's something for everybody, I think.

00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:11.251
Mom!

00:44:12.731 --> 00:44:15.680
What's happened? Are you hurt?
What's going on here?

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.640
I wasn't lying to you.
The Davenport is on the way.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:22.087
- Wait till you see it, Mum.
- Then you did get a raise.

00:44:24.612 --> 00:44:26.364
Oh, glory!

00:44:29.812 --> 00:44:32.196
Mom! Here's one for you.

00:44:32.296 --> 00:44:33.681
Oh, Mom!

00:44:33.781 --> 00:44:37.316
Why don't you get wise to yourself?
Who do you think you are anyway?

00:44:37.416 --> 00:44:40.238
If it's good enough for us,
who are you to say...

00:44:40.338 --> 00:44:43.159
- It stinks. It stinks.
- He stinks.

00:44:43.259 --> 00:44:46.681
One more crack out of you
and I'll bust you right in the nose.

00:44:46.781 --> 00:44:49.881
- Let's see you do it.
- I will, you snake-eyed...

00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:53.560
- Sit down before you burst a blood vessel.
- Sit down, Bildocker.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:56.878
Let's talk this over in a nice friendly way.

00:44:56.978 --> 00:45:02.562
We think, "Maxford's. Magnificent and
mellow. Just what the doctor ordered."

00:45:02.662 --> 00:45:05.842
- It's brief, it's smooth, it's pungent.
- It's putrid.

00:45:05.942 --> 00:45:09.840
- Why is it putrid, Bildocker?
- Because it stinks.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.723
Why isn't he back? Where is he?
In the barber shop?

00:45:12.823 --> 00:45:16.322
Never mind him.
Tell him to go soak his head in a barrel.

00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:18.400
- Is Mr Einbrewster there?
- <i>No, sir.</i>

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.322
Why? Where is everybody? Playing pool?

00:45:22.422 --> 00:45:24.762
- Is Mr Grobel there?
- <i>No, sir.</i>

00:45:24.862 --> 00:45:27.601
Is he having an operation?
What kind of a firm is this?

00:45:27.701 --> 00:45:30.601
- <i>He's in the contest room.</i>
- What do you mean?

00:45:30.701 --> 00:45:32.963
- The contest is over.
- <i>He's down there.</i>

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:36.643
What are they doing? Playing poker?
Never mind. I'll find out myself.

00:45:36.743 --> 00:45:38.205
Horse feathers!

00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:40.803
- Don't be vulgar, Bildocker!
- Or what?

00:45:40.903 --> 00:45:42.844
Who are you?

00:45:42.944 --> 00:45:46.002
Well, what are you arguing about now?

00:45:46.102 --> 00:45:51.526
Now, would you get back to your offices
and try and sell some coffee for a change?

00:45:51.626 --> 00:45:55.726
Or am I being too commercial?
And while I'm on that subject,

00:45:55.826 --> 00:46:01.443
I wanna tell you that of all the congregations
of fatheads that I've ever gazed upon,

00:46:01.543 --> 00:46:03.485
you take the lardpail!

00:46:03.585 --> 00:46:07.325
So kiss each other goodbye.
All except you, Bildocker.

00:46:07.425 --> 00:46:09.563
- What about the contest?
- What about it?

00:46:09.663 --> 00:46:12.085
Now you've killed it,
you want a postmortem?

00:46:12.185 --> 00:46:14.365
- Shouldn't we choose a winner?
- You did.

00:46:14.465 --> 00:46:18.242
- We certainly did not.
- You certainly did. What do you mean?

00:46:18.342 --> 00:46:22.803
- We haven't reached a verdict.
- You certainly have reached a verdict.

00:46:22.903 --> 00:46:26.965
Are you trying to tell me
that you haven't reached a verdict yet?

00:46:27.065 --> 00:46:31.125
- We have not.
- Then why did you send him a telegram?

00:46:31.225 --> 00:46:33.486
- Send who a telegram?
- McTavish!

00:46:33.586 --> 00:46:38.646
- We didn't send... Who's McTavish?
- You certainly did send a telegram!

00:46:38.746 --> 00:46:41.124
We certainly did not send a telegram.

00:46:41.224 --> 00:46:45.765
You didn't? Well, then who... who...?
Who...?

00:46:45.865 --> 00:46:47.816
Jumping Jerusalem!

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.449
- Get my lawyer!
- Which one?

00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:00.845
Schubel, Snivel, Abercrombie and Snitch!

00:47:00.945 --> 00:47:03.049
Quiet! Get me Shindel Bros!

00:47:03.149 --> 00:47:07.047
We have to keep cool and collected!
Collected! Holy moley!

00:47:07.147 --> 00:47:09.525
- Bank the call
- Bank the call?

00:47:09.625 --> 00:47:13.409
Call the bank! What's the matter with you?
Holy mackerel!

00:47:15.102 --> 00:47:17.007
What? Give me a hat.

00:47:17.107 --> 00:47:21.567
- Get me Minsk, Minsk, Binsk and Binsk.
- What kind of a hat, Mr Shindel?

00:47:21.667 --> 00:47:23.618
- A hat!
- Yes, sir.

00:47:26.302 --> 00:47:27.302
Stop!

00:47:30.582 --> 00:47:31.582
Stop!

00:47:32.023 --> 00:47:34.617
No, go! We'll go with you!

00:47:42.823 --> 00:47:46.208
Jimmy! We're running low.
Get another load.

00:47:46.308 --> 00:47:48.659
Mary? Where's Mary? All right, Mary.

00:47:50.784 --> 00:47:53.051
Marsha? Marsha, there you are.

00:47:53.151 --> 00:47:55.738
Nobody's been forgotten. Be careful.

00:48:16.585 --> 00:48:19.890
- You forgot to get a present for yourself.
- What?

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:24.821
- You forgot to get a present for yourself.
- I don't need one, I've got you.

00:48:32.106 --> 00:48:34.461
- It's a big fish.
- No...

00:48:37.626 --> 00:48:39.931
There he is! Come on, grab him!

00:48:40.031 --> 00:48:41.975
Look, Jimmy!

00:48:42.075 --> 00:48:45.016
- Here's your Davenport, mom.
- Wait till you see it!

00:48:45.116 --> 00:48:47.462
Come on, get him! Take him away!

00:48:49.747 --> 00:48:51.703
Hey, you! What...?

00:48:53.067 --> 00:48:55.494
What's the idea, busting up my plane?

00:48:55.594 --> 00:48:58.733
- It's my plane.
- Jimmy MacDonald gave it to me!

00:48:58.833 --> 00:49:02.293
- Yeah? When I get through with him...
- What's going on?

00:49:02.393 --> 00:49:06.773
- Officer, arrest all these people.
- Who do you think you are? Hitler?

00:49:06.873 --> 00:49:09.055
Listen, you...

00:49:09.155 --> 00:49:13.017
- You listen to me, baby...
- Well, can't you do something?

00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:15.065
Say, er, hey...

00:49:15.949 --> 00:49:18.977
- No! No!
- This belongs to Shindel Brothers.

00:49:19.077 --> 00:49:21.895
Come and help me!

00:49:21.995 --> 00:49:23.894
- No! No!
- Be sensible, girl.

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:26.336
- What are you doing?
- This is stolen.

00:49:26.436 --> 00:49:28.226
Oh, it is, is it?

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:39.540
He who laughs last lasts laughs!

00:49:50.991 --> 00:49:55.030
Everything is stolen,
down to the last pogo stick - everything.

00:49:58.311 --> 00:50:00.898
Ah, you see? "Shindel Brothers. Toy Land."

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:04.099
He comes into my store
with a phoney cheque and...

00:50:04.199 --> 00:50:07.061
Who came into your store
with a phoney cheque?

00:50:07.161 --> 00:50:09.739
He ain't even got the decency to run away!
Lowlife.

00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:12.382
- Listen you...
- Officer, arrest him.

00:50:12.482 --> 00:50:14.819
- You starting that again?
- What?

00:50:14.919 --> 00:50:18.781
I've known that kid
since he was knee-high to a cockroach.

00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:22.700
- What's he supposed to have done?
- Supposed to have done?

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.459
He's supposed to have given
me a sour cheque,

00:50:25.559 --> 00:50:28.698
then he's supposed to have bought
a diamond ring -

00:50:28.798 --> 00:50:32.061
which I suppose I don't see there -
and a nice fur coat.

00:50:32.161 --> 00:50:36.182
Then he takes half the toys,
waves the rubber cheque, and leaves.

00:50:36.282 --> 00:50:38.301
Who says it's a rubber cheque?

00:50:38.401 --> 00:50:40.459
Dr Maxford of Maxford House.

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:43.220
Dr Maxford gave me the cheque himself.

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.581
- Mr Swindle...
- Shindel.

00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:49.943
I know this boy since his poppa and momma
wasn't even married yet.

00:50:50.043 --> 00:50:52.541
The whole family is a little bit crazy.

00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:56.861
- $25,000 - can you imagine?
- A dreamer.

00:50:56.961 --> 00:50:59.621
- Mrs Schwartz, Mr Zimmerman...
- Let me handle this.

00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:01.184
He gave me a cheque.

00:51:01.284 --> 00:51:03.383
- If he says he did...
- ...then he did.

00:51:03.483 --> 00:51:05.662
Just go home and think it all over.

00:51:05.762 --> 00:51:09.183
I'll break you in so many pieces...
You're all witnesses!

00:51:09.283 --> 00:51:13.029
- Trying to imitate an officer?
- Who's imitating anybody?

00:51:21.876 --> 00:51:24.426
Officer! Officer, arrest this man!

00:51:24.526 --> 00:51:28.465
- That's been tried.
- There's been some sort of mix-up here...

00:51:28.565 --> 00:51:31.346
You have the effrontery
even to speak to me?

00:51:31.446 --> 00:51:35.264
What? I just want you to tell them
that you gave me a cheque.

00:51:35.364 --> 00:51:38.103
- What cheque?
- The one in your office.

00:51:38.203 --> 00:51:40.506
- Let me see it.
- Certainly.

00:51:42.877 --> 00:51:46.262
Oh, that cheque. Boy, do I feel better!

00:51:46.362 --> 00:51:49.706
- Hey, you're destroying the evidence.
- Who are you?

00:51:49.806 --> 00:51:52.826
- Shindel!
- Officer, arrest these people!

00:51:52.926 --> 00:51:56.303
- Listen, Mussolini...
- If there's something wrong

00:51:56.403 --> 00:51:58.585
what did you give me the cheque for?

00:51:58.685 --> 00:52:02.505
You know perfectly well,
in my life I never heard of you!

00:52:02.605 --> 00:52:05.984
- You didn't give me a cheque?
- That was by mistake.

00:52:06.084 --> 00:52:09.028
I was suspicious of you as soon as I saw
you.

00:52:09.128 --> 00:52:11.067
You mean I didn't win?

00:52:11.167 --> 00:52:13.666
You know perfectly well you didn't win!

00:52:13.766 --> 00:52:17.064
- But...
- He's entirely responsible, I see it all.

00:52:17.164 --> 00:52:19.463
I know how big firms work, God forbid.

00:52:19.563 --> 00:52:23.227
This is an honest boy.
I knew it the minute I looked at him.

00:52:23.327 --> 00:52:28.589
You gave him that cheque, you numbskull.
I should take back the merchandise I sold.

00:52:28.689 --> 00:52:33.747
Carry that Davenport upstairs for the lady.
A present from Dr Maxford.

00:52:33.847 --> 00:52:38.828
And buy the children more ice cream -
they'll enjoy my toys much better.

00:52:38.928 --> 00:52:42.960
- Dr Maxford is paying.
- I'll see you in Hoboken before I pay!

00:52:43.681 --> 00:52:48.269
And I'll see you in court,
and you'll pay for everything. With costs!

00:52:48.369 --> 00:52:51.310
- In a pig's nose!
- Pigs or no pigs.

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:54.473
And another thing...

00:52:55.802 --> 00:52:57.793
Oh, you will, will you?

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:01.117
Don't take the good ones.

00:53:04.242 --> 00:53:08.554
It doesn't matter, honey.
You can't lose anything you never had.

00:53:11.802 --> 00:53:15.682
I don't want his old ring or... or his old skunk.

00:53:16.683 --> 00:53:19.675
What I can't figure is
who sent that telegram.

00:53:26.003 --> 00:53:27.988
Hello, Jimmy. Hello, Betty.

00:53:28.088 --> 00:53:30.040
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:53:32.644 --> 00:53:37.109
- What's that?
- Is this the Davenport your ma wanted?

00:53:37.209 --> 00:53:41.190
The crank fits on here
and when you turn it it...

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:45.553
Makes into a full-size double bed at night.
Guy said it works swell.

00:53:45.653 --> 00:53:47.593
What did you go get that for?

00:53:47.693 --> 00:53:53.117
Well, we kinda hoped that
it might make up for the... phoney telegram.

00:53:54.325 --> 00:53:57.630
- It was a joke.
- It wasn't very funny.

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:00.325
Oh. I get it.

00:54:02.765 --> 00:54:04.882
Oh, Jimmy...

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:27.632
- Hi, Mr Jimmy!
- Hello, Sam. The boss gone yet?

00:54:27.732 --> 00:54:30.872
No, he's still in there conniving on
something.

00:54:30.972 --> 00:54:35.512
- Tell him in the morning.
- I was glad to hear about your good luck.

00:54:35.612 --> 00:54:38.796
- Do you need a valet?
- No thanks, Sam.

00:54:38.896 --> 00:54:43.236
Well, sir, I guess you is right -
pride rides before a fall.

00:54:43.336 --> 00:54:47.056
But not everybody hits the jackpot
while they is young and all.

00:54:47.267 --> 00:54:49.209
You said it.

00:54:49.526 --> 00:54:52.650
- Look.
- Hello, pussy.

00:54:53.727 --> 00:54:56.197
Is it good luck
when a black cat crosses your path?

00:54:56.297 --> 00:54:59.201
That all depends on what happens
afterwards.

00:54:59.828 --> 00:55:01.237
You said it.

00:55:01.337 --> 00:55:03.763
Sure don't happen to everybody, sir!

00:55:09.289 --> 00:55:11.883
- Yes, sir.
- Look.

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:14.601
Good evening.

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:25.357
- Pretty snazzy, eh?
- Yeah.

00:55:25.457 --> 00:55:26.796
Lovely.

00:55:26.896 --> 00:55:28.636
Thank you.

00:55:28.736 --> 00:55:30.722
- Be careful.
- We will.

00:56:04.973 --> 00:56:08.329
It was gonna be nice, wasn't it?

00:56:10.293 --> 00:56:14.525
Stop it, honey.
Come on, now, cut it out. Come on.

00:56:23.734 --> 00:56:25.334
Come in.

00:56:26.414 --> 00:56:29.682
- I hope I'm not intruding?
- No, sir, I was just coming to see you.

00:56:29.782 --> 00:56:31.839
We stopped to look at the office...

00:56:31.939 --> 00:56:34.281
- So I see. I hope you like it.
- It's beautiful.

00:56:34.381 --> 00:56:38.644
It isn't every young man who gets his own
office and a private secretary at your age.

00:56:38.744 --> 00:56:42.279
With many of them
I'd be afraid it would go to their heads

00:56:42.379 --> 00:56:45.840
- but you have your feet on the ground.
- Thank you, sir.

00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:51.204
I mean it sincerely. Mr Jenkins and I
discussed our little meeting after you left

00:56:51.304 --> 00:56:55.761
and I want you to know that we were
genuinely impressed - genuinely so.

00:56:55.861 --> 00:56:59.842
- That's nice to hear...
- The more we thought about your ideas

00:56:59.942 --> 00:57:04.960
the more aware we became of their
pungency, their brevity, their crispness.

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:09.282
- Thank you, sir, it's...
- You have a genuine talent for slogans.

00:57:09.382 --> 00:57:11.841
It must be like having an ear for music.

00:57:11.941 --> 00:57:16.206
Take me, I sing flat. You, on the other hand,
are a born sloganeer.

00:57:16.306 --> 00:57:19.645
"It's bred in the bean." Hot ziggety!

00:57:19.745 --> 00:57:25.682
Well, it's certainly wonderful to hear, Mr
Baxter. You've made me feel a lot better.

00:57:25.782 --> 00:57:28.923
They're still the same ideas, aren't they?

00:57:29.023 --> 00:57:33.606
If they were good this afternoon
they're still good. They're the same.

00:57:33.706 --> 00:57:35.806
- Of course they are.
- Of course they are.

00:57:35.906 --> 00:57:41.646
- I'm not quite sure I have your thought.
- You still think they're good, don't you?

00:57:41.746 --> 00:57:44.122
Well, of course I do. Why?

00:57:44.222 --> 00:57:49.083
Since they were good and they're still good
they have to be good.

00:57:49.183 --> 00:57:54.725
And then it wouldn't make any difference
if I hadn't won the Maxford House contest.

00:57:54.825 --> 00:57:56.927
- Would it?
- Of course it would.

00:57:57.027 --> 00:57:59.526
- Oh, it would.
- Certainly it would.

00:57:59.626 --> 00:58:01.684
- Why?
- I'm no genius,

00:58:01.784 --> 00:58:05.564
I didn't keep my father's money
by backing my own judgment.

00:58:05.664 --> 00:58:10.807
I make mistakes every day -
I've got a whole warehouse full of mistakes.

00:58:10.907 --> 00:58:13.726
I should say it would make a difference.

00:58:13.826 --> 00:58:18.089
You see, I think your ideas are good
because they sound good to me

00:58:18.189 --> 00:58:23.886
but I know your ideas are good because you
won this contest over millions of aspirants.

00:58:23.986 --> 00:58:27.286
- But Mr Baxter...
- Call it commercial insurance.

00:58:27.386 --> 00:58:30.766
When a horse wins the derby
you back him for the breaker.

00:58:30.866 --> 00:58:32.969
- I didn't win it.
- The breaker?

00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:35.211
The contest. It was a joke.

00:58:36.021 --> 00:58:38.811
- A joke?
- That's what they meant it to be.

00:58:38.911 --> 00:58:41.010
- Who did?
- Some of the fellas.

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:44.407
They wanted to see how I'd look
when I got the news.

00:58:44.507 --> 00:58:48.568
Tell me their names and we'll see
how they look when I give them some news!

00:58:48.668 --> 00:58:52.206
I wouldn't care to do that, I...
Oh, it doesn't matter.

00:58:52.306 --> 00:58:54.208
It doesn't matter?

00:58:54.308 --> 00:58:58.492
After I spent a whole afternoon
listening to a lot of... baloney?

00:58:58.592 --> 00:59:03.527
Entirely predicated on the winning of
this contest? And giving you this office?

00:59:03.627 --> 00:59:07.572
- But what about my slogan?
- I don't know, what about it?

00:59:07.672 --> 00:59:11.288
We'll find that out!
There'll be plenty of time for that.

00:59:11.388 --> 00:59:17.052
But I won't made a fool of. I can't go around
giving out private offices and secretaries

00:59:17.152 --> 00:59:21.689
on the strength of a prank
that personally I consider far from funny!

00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:23.929
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:28.810
It's gonna be hard to face that gang
tomorrow if I'm back at that desk.

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:34.371
It would be just as hard to face them
from in here if you didn't belong here.

00:59:34.471 --> 00:59:38.052
- He does belong in here.
- What is the joke this time?

00:59:38.152 --> 00:59:41.131
He belongs in here
because he thinks he does.

00:59:41.231 --> 00:59:44.690
That's very high-falutin'
but from a practical...

00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:49.134
It is practical, Mr Baxter.
The most practical idea you ever had.

00:59:49.234 --> 00:59:52.531
He belongs in here
because he thinks he has ideas.

00:59:52.631 --> 00:59:56.011
He belongs in here
until he proves himself or fails

00:59:56.111 --> 00:59:59.810
and then somebody else
until he proves himself or fails

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:02.056
and so on and so on for always.

01:00:02.947 --> 01:00:06.896
I don't know how to put it into words
like Jimmy could but...

01:00:06.996 --> 01:00:11.532
all he wants, all any of them want,
is a... is a chance to show...

01:00:11.632 --> 01:00:15.092
To find out what they've got
while they're still young

01:00:15.192 --> 01:00:19.100
and... and burning like
a short cut or a stepping stone.

01:00:20.908 --> 01:00:25.054
I know they're not gonna succeed,
at least most of them aren't.

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:28.416
Most of them will be
like Mr Waterbury soon enough.

01:00:28.516 --> 01:00:33.255
But they won't mind it, they'll be happy
because they had their chance.

01:00:33.355 --> 01:00:37.335
Because it's one thing
to muff a chance when you get it but...

01:00:37.435 --> 01:00:40.501
it's another thing
never to have had a chance.

01:00:42.429 --> 01:00:44.738
And his name's already on the door.

01:00:46.469 --> 01:00:50.296
Well, if anything decided me
that would be it.

01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:53.216
- Oh, Mr Baxter...
- You've talked enough.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:58.057
The desks have already been moved
and the name is painted on, as you said.

01:00:58.157 --> 01:01:02.738
So we'll try it for a very short time,
at no advance in salary, you understand.

01:01:02.838 --> 01:01:04.938
- Yes, sir.
- And for a very short time.

01:01:05.038 --> 01:01:09.059
- Yes, sir.
- This is a business, not a cultural project.

01:01:09.159 --> 01:01:13.260
- You'll never be sorry.
- I'm sorry already, so let it go at that.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.343
Good night and try to be on time
in the morning.

01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:19.861
Oh... pshaw!

01:01:22.351 --> 01:01:25.779
- Isn't it wonderful?
- You were wonderful.

01:01:25.879 --> 01:01:29.619
- But I'm a bit leery about me.
- Don't talk like a fathead.

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:34.257
This is the chance of a lifetime
and you know you've got what it takes.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:38.461
I didn't until I got that telegram
and now I don't know any more.

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:41.458
I'm like Mr Baxter, that's why I didn't speak.

01:01:41.558 --> 01:01:44.981
Well, it brought us together
and that's something.

01:01:45.081 --> 01:01:49.351
I got the ring to prove it,
and you can't back out now or I'd sue you.

01:01:52.193 --> 01:01:54.343
Oh, you poor kid.

01:01:56.673 --> 01:01:59.710
You'll see we have plenty to be thankful for.

01:02:03.394 --> 01:02:04.394
Sure.

01:02:12.634 --> 01:02:15.990
- There's that cat again.
- Hello.

01:02:30.155 --> 01:02:32.350
- Good night!
- Good night, Sam.

01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:55.262
- Look.
- Yeah.

01:02:55.362 --> 01:02:59.822
- Sure looked funny this afternoon.
- Ah, the old buzzard.

01:02:59.922 --> 01:03:03.222
- Were you to a fish fry, Dr Maxford?
- No, I wasn't.

01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:06.824
- Smells like a seven-course banquet.
- I wasn't to a banquet!

01:03:06.924 --> 01:03:09.184
- Dr Maxford!
- What do you want?

01:03:09.284 --> 01:03:13.706
I got some good news. It took some doing
but I won those clerks over.

01:03:13.806 --> 01:03:17.747
The way I feel, Bildocker,
it just doesn't matter any more.

01:03:17.847 --> 01:03:21.026
This is the stupidest, the most asinine...!

01:03:21.126 --> 01:03:24.822
- Listen to the slogan!
- I don't wish to hear the slogan!

01:03:24.922 --> 01:03:27.628
I don't wish to hear any more
about the whole mess!

01:03:27.728 --> 01:03:31.423
Pick your winner, send him a cheque
and tell him to go...

01:03:31.523 --> 01:03:34.787
Listen to this, will ya? Is this good!

01:03:34.887 --> 01:03:39.786
"If you don't sleep at night,
it isn't the coffee, it's the bunk."

01:03:39.886 --> 01:03:43.713
Is that a slogan? It's what you call a pun.
Believe me, it's some pun!

01:03:43.868 --> 01:03:47.731
We just sent the winner a telegram,
a guy called James MacDon...
