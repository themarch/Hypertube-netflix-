00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.077
It was an unbearably hot day.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.921
Someone stole your gun?

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.458
Yes, I have no excuse.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.459
POLlCE HEADQUARTERS
HOMlClDE

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:16.125
The pistol had been lifted off of
Murakami, a rookie in Homicide.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.230
How many bullets were in the gun?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.873
All seven, sir.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.099
A Colt?

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.170
The stolen piece was
a compact Colt revolver,

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.142
pinched right after firing practice.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.046
How'd you do?

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.711
No good. I was up
all night on a stakeout.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.917
- Missed every shot?
- No, one bull's-eye in a stump.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.161
Get home and rest
those bloodshot eyes.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.856
Actually, everything looks yellow.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.728
- I'm off, then.
- Right, bye.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.709
Murakami was beat.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:00.505
And then there was
that awul heat.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.684
On the bus, the air was so thick,
he felt woozy.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.627
A wailing infant shook with tears,

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:24.496
and the woman beside him reeked
with the stink of cheap perfume.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:55.652
Sir, I 'll accept any punishment
you give me.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.059
Sir...

00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:01.256
Will you cut all that "sir" crap?
This isn't the army.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:05.838
Yes. Lieutenant, sir,
what am I supposed to do?

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:10.738
Supposed to do? Well, you can't just
stand there while we decide.

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:18.473
I'd check with the pickpocket experts.
Might as well go to the source.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.811
LARCENY

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:26.023
Well, that was rotten luck.

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:29.286
So, they gonna sack you?

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.488
Yes, probably.

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:33.490
You're under...

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:34.894
Lt. Nakajima.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:40.097
Oh, man. He must've raked you
over the coals.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:46.339
He looks like he'll rip you apart,
but he's cooler than you'd think.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:50.972
He's not enough of a stickler
to dump you.

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:53.415
Take a seat.

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:58.850
So I hear you got a look
at the pickpocket's face?

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:05.089
Go over to Evidence, where they got mugs
on everyone with a record.

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.754
Give 'em an age range

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:11.862
and tell 'em he's "a rider,"
vehicles are his stock in trade.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.199
What else?

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:23.709
We break 'em down by age, sex, methods,
type of goods - that's about it.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.550
Any luck?

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.955
He's not so bad,

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:37.927
your lieutenant. Called me
and asked me to look out for you.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:44.065
What's the problem?

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.435
I don't see him here.

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.040
But you know,

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:52.372
pickpockets sometimes
work in pairs,

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:55.447
passing the goods
off to a partner.

00:06:55.615 --> 00:07:00.416
Remember any other suspicious
characters on the bus?

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.748
Well, there was a middle-aged lady
in a dress next to me.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.622
On which side of you?
This side?

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:13.857
Yes, my right. On the side
where I carry my pistol.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:16.193
Sounds fishy to me.

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:19.303
We got some famous
light-fingered ladies, too.

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:22.868
Say, show me the women's file.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:56.006
Boy, do these faces
ever bring back memories.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:01.504
Say, this train pickpocket
just kicked the bucket.

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.478
Is that so?

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:10.788
Hey. This is the one.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.181
You mean her?

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:13.916
It was definitely her.

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.718
But you said
she had on a dress.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:21.489
That's strange. Ogin's always been
known by her kimonos.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.464
And way off her turf.

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:27.061
I'm sure. She had a perm
and stank of perfume.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.403
A perm, Ogin?
Times sure have changed.

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.510
Get me her record.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:36.944
No need. I know her
down to the moles on her back.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:43.383
But she's always gone after cash.
Why'd she want a piece?

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.915
Must've hit the skids.

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.389
Where is she?

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.052
I know her haunts,
but she'll never confess.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.288
I'll manage.

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:53.556
Manage, huh?

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:54.825
Let me see her.

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:56.264
See her, huh?

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:27.265
The boss must be out flat
in this heat.

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:33.469
After all, he's 78 years old.

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:37.973
Will she come?

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:42.103
Ogin? Oh, yeah, shows up
every day like clockwork.

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:46.912
She's the type that's conscientious
about petty stuff.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.154
She's been a regular here
since the boom years.

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:13.968
What's wrong?

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:16.774
A story on a stolen pistol.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:20.817
A homicide detective shocked
by a stolen gun?

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:26.049
No, I just wondered
if it might be mine.

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.327
Hey, long time no see.

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:39.297
Oh, it's you, lchikawa-san.
I figured you'd kicked the bucket.

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:43.771
That's a helluva welcome.

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.240
Better than some.

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:47.678
What's better?

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:51.980
The way you look in a dress.
My associate here said

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:56.019
you'd taken up dresses,
so I had to see for myself.

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.585
You know this guy, don't you?

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:04.725
Who knows? At my age, I've stopped
noticing handsome young men.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.930
You're slippery as the eels
on the menu here.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:11.696
Why say that?
I've got nothing to hide.

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:16.365
You sure? Didn't you pull
a terrible misdeed on the bus?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.310
Give me back my pistol.
I'll leave you out of the rest.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.847
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't go accusing me.

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.884
Please, I just need
to get it back.

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:30.079
Just give me a clue.

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:34.692
Help him out.
The guy's just a greenhorn.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.160
Listen, mess with a rookie
and you'll be sorry later.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:42.664
I don't know.
You're violating my civil rights.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.860
Awful stylish language, there.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:48.063
- I can do better than that.
- Like what?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.673
Bye-bye.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:57.905
She's a dead end.

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:00.174
No, she's not.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:01.877
But...

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:05.080
Then I'll tail her
until she comes clean.

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:06.781
Thank you so much.

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:12.721
Watch the buildings with two exits.

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:37.502
Man, you're a pain.
Give it a rest.

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:38.938
Not until you talk.

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:40.406
And my civil rights?

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:41.910
I'm just on a stroll.

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:43.480
Suit yourself, then.

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:46.517
Please, just give me a hint.

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:26.984
What time is it?

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:30.923
That was the 1 1 :30 train.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.997
That kid still hanging around?

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:35.723
Sure is.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:42.605
I told him to come in,
or the mosquitoes would get him.

00:15:43.742 --> 00:15:47.234
He said he's not drinking,
so he'd stay outside.

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:50.143
It's rare
for a young man these days.

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:57.585
I don't know what's up,
but why don't you go talk to him?

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.987
Gimme a beer.

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:05.128
Haven't you had enough?

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:07.322
It's not for me.

00:16:19.244 --> 00:16:23.476
Come and get this.
You must be starving. Eat up.

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:26.583
Come and get it.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:45.034
So, you win.

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:49.169
Eat up.
The beer's nice and cold, too.

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.309
- That's not what l...
- I know.

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:54.275
I told you, you win.

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:58.413
We're not playing "What's My Line?"
Just a hint, okay?

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:03.345
- Check the pistol dealers.
- Pistol dealers?

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.685
Man, are you green.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.561
Places that unload guns.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.030
They buy, sell and even rent 'em.
Nasty business.

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:17.293
Where are they?

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:19.233
Wouldn't know.

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:28.708
But I've heard if you wander
the alleys downtown looking desperate,

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:33.414
the scouts will come
and tug at your sleeves.

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:37.919
Isn't it time
you let me off the hook?

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:42.085
What an awful rotten day.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:46.721
No one from Homicide ever
tailed me before. Day and night.

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:49.692
I'm beat.

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:55.002
Look, how pretty that is.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.573
In the last 20 years,
I've completely forgotten

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:05.949
how wonderful the stars are.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.245
Can you take care of me?

00:26:58.483 --> 00:27:00.610
- Can you afford it?
- Sure.

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:02.643
It's loaded. It'll cost.

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.584
- How many rounds?
- Huh?

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:07.190
- How much?
- Short term...

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:09.188
You want a girl, right?

00:27:09.728 --> 00:27:10.660
No, this racket.

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:14.796
Not my game.

00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:17.432
Liar. My guys
told me about you.

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:21.129
Get out of here.
I'll sick the cops on you.

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:41.308
Too tired to get mad?

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.718
You're in pretty good shape
to be so down and out.

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:53.058
You need a piece?

00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:58.396
Don't act dumb.

00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:02.064
I'm asking you if you want a gun.

00:29:04.442 --> 00:29:05.932
How much?

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:09.212
You're broke, so drop the cool act.

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:11.006
Your rice card.

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:13.616
Rice card?
You mean my ration card?

00:29:14.285 --> 00:29:17.083
- If you don't even have that, no deal.
- I've got it.

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:25.426
Come to the Cafè Conga
on Suzuran Boulevard at 9:00.

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:28.498
Talk to the bitch
with the white flower.

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.074
Ration card.

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:51.276
Right.

00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:55.511
- What the hell!
- Police.

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:22.305
I'm from Headquarters.
Can I question her in the back?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.004
It's awful hot in there.

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:28.982
The roof's tin. Even at night,
it's like roasting in an oven.

00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:55.246
Is this the only kind of gun
you handle?

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.281
Any old pistol
works in this racket.

00:31:58.449 --> 00:32:00.576
Handled any Colts lately?

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:02.709
What's a Colt?

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:04.615
It's about this big.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.204
Like this.

00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:25.501
I loaned one out yesterday.

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:28.840
Where and when
are you supposed to get it back?

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:33.416
Shut up. I was supposed to get it back
tonight, where I met you.

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:37.952
I ran by him at the door
when you took off after me.

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.983
Boy, was he shocked.

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:54.769
Hey, that means you've still got
his ration card. Show me.

00:32:55.773 --> 00:32:58.674
Man, you're a real amateur.

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:02.572
We hit 'em up for our share
when they bring the gun back.

00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:07.711
This business is all about taking 'em
for everything we can.

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:11.582
After all, we're dealing with crooks.
Tough customers.

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:13.223
Hardly my game.

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:13.982
Meaning?

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:19.028
Remember the guy reading the paper
behind you? He's my lookout.

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:21.665
He holds on to the guy's ration card.

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:26.361
No use panicking.
They've all flown the coop by now.

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:44.086
Get it together, man.
Hurry up and take me in already.

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:49.450
It's so damned hot in here,
I'll roast to death.

00:33:57.635 --> 00:33:59.728
No big deal, anyway.

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:06.466
Why are you so desperate
to get your Colt back?

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:09.477
You should have tried to grab

00:34:09.647 --> 00:34:12.844
a pile of guns from that fence,
not just your Colt.

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:17.418
Shouldn't have brought her in.

00:34:17.588 --> 00:34:18.316
But, sir...

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:23.950
I know how you feel. But there's
no proof she ever even had your Colt.

00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:27.023
There's more than one Colt
in the world.

00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:32.936
There was an assault
and robbery last night.

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:36.804
They took a bullet
out of the victim's elbow.

00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:40.171
It's over in Evidence now.
It came from a Colt.

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:45.507
Cut it out.
No point imagining the worst.

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:49.141
Homicide detectives can't afford
to be so sensitive.

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:54.554
You look awful thin.
Been pounding the pavement?

00:34:57.161 --> 00:34:59.561
Well, better to suffer
while you're young.

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:02.427
It's official.
- What?

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:06.335
You'll work three months at half pay.

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:09.370
And how about taking the day off?

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.441
EVlDENCE - WEAPONS

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:39.027
Yes?

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:41.398
Who examined that Colt bullet?

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:43.369
Oh, I did.

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:47.841
There's no record
of a bullet from this Colt.

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:52.876
Unless there's a match,
bullets never help us crack cases.

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:58.144
Just like a fingerprint,
the spiral marks on the surface...

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.733
What is it?

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:13.193
I misfired over here once.

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:14.929
Hmm. So?

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:34.758
Same type of bullet.

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.052
Please compare it.

00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:37.717
Where'd you find it?

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:39.453
Please.

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:28.274
Congratulations.

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:32.774
It's from the same Colt.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.611
Excellent police work.

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:36.810
Have a look for yourself.

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.956
Thank you.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.064
LETTER OF RESlGNATlON

00:37:57.308 --> 00:37:59.276
You're taking responsibility?

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.739
There's no excuse.

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:12.150
Bad luck either makes a man
or destroys him.

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:16.620
Are you gonna let it destroy you?

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:21.061
Depending how you take it,
bad luck can be a big break.

00:38:22.566 --> 00:38:25.558
Why not get yourself
put on this case?

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:29.731
Officer Abe's representing
Homicide on this one.

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:31.738
Like to join him?
- Yes.

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:37.544
Sato's with the precinct.
Great cop. Used to be with Homicide.

00:38:38.182 --> 00:38:40.707
I'll call him
and get you on the team.

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:46.052
And before you go...
that pistol dealer's moll you brought in.

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:48.453
Why not talk to her again?

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:50.251
She may know something.

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:52.852
I'm on my way.

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:18.412
- Number 1 8, please.
- She's out.

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:22.286
- Out?
- A precinct cop took her in.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.792
- Precinct cop?
- Yes. Room 4.

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.589
Thank you.

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:43.813
Excuse me.

00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:47.216
I'm Murakami, Homicide.

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:51.316
That's the guy who booked me.

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:55.486
I'm Sato.

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:57.321
What? Oh, Sato-san.

00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:58.325
What is it?

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:01.329
They've put me
on that new case of yours.

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:04.593
I just got orders
to work with you.

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:06.759
I'll need your advice.

00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:08.802
Looking forward to it.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.119
About the Colt
this woman handled?

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:24.846
Yeah, Abe filled me in on it.

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:28.423
Besides, it's the rare thief
that packs a Colt.

00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:33.991
This guy you loaned the Colt to,
what's he like?

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:38.798
What's he like?
Let's see...

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:44.806
He had a winter jacket, even in this heat.
- Black?

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:49.240
- How did you know?
- He's also a lefty.

00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:51.847
Yeah? Is that right?

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:55.577
Well, you can think it over
while you're smoking.

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:39.928
Hey, I remember.
He lit a match with his left hand.

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:43.896
I remember he was shaking bad.

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:48.732
I said, "You're not gonna blow
your brains out with that pistol?"

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:51.306
What's the guy's name?

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:58.079
- How would I know?
- Liar. You saw his ration card.

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:04.752
Sure I did. But it was pretty hard
to make out the letters.

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:08.521
I always hated school.

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:11.389
And who's got the ration card?

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:13.189
His name?

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.230
- Dunno.
- It's Kimura, right?

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:16.764
No, it isn't.

00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:21.194
Who is it, then?

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:24.073
Guess you're protecting
your boyfriend.

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:25.936
- I am not.
- Liar.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.601
- I'm not lying!
- When they protect 'em like this,

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:31.907
you can be sure
they're an item.

00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:38.748
- Name's Honda.
- Okay, spill it all while you're at it.

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:45.623
I'll help myself to another one.

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:48.692
Honda's digs?

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.696
I wouldn't know.

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:54.334
I really don't know.

00:42:57.575 --> 00:43:00.840
He's just stringing me along.
He'd never tell me.

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:03.002
Where's he hang out, then?

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.576
I don't know.

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:10.615
I remember.

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:16.625
I've heard he's keen on baseball.
I bet he goes to the stadium.

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:18.489
Does he have a record?

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:19.856
Yup.

00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:25.727
He was bragging how he did time
for half-killing a woman.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.461
- When was that?
- Who knows.

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:31.865
All right.

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:35.534
C'mon, wait till I've finished
my smoke.

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:39.205
Shoot. You get what you need
and you're gone.

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:44.284
Go see what you can
turn up on Honda.

00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:47.822
It may just be an alias,
but it'll get you started.

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:50.893
And where are you going?

00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:52.753
Well.

00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:56.498
What's the coolest place around?

00:43:59.069 --> 00:44:00.229
Sato-san.

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:06.009
I found it.
His real name's Tachibana.

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:16.713
Get a bunch of copies
of this photo. Then a warrant.

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:22.325
I don't know anything about
the location or the investigation.

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:26.589
Your arresting her was a big break.
We're nearly done.

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:32.725
We pick up Honda, get the ration card,
and put out an APB. It's got to be him.

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:40.703
A black winter jacket.

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.444
A Colt.

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:46.939
Which he clutched in his left hand.

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:49.210
A hand that was shaking

00:44:49.386 --> 00:44:50.751
Iike a leaf.

00:44:53.223 --> 00:44:56.488
'Cause he panicked
and shot it off for no reason.

00:44:57.294 --> 00:45:00.627
Just your typical case
of an amateur running amok,

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:04.427
although the consequences
for the victims are severe.

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:07.292
A young woman?

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:13.701
Yeah, he got 40,000 yen off of her.

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:16.938
Three years' worth of savings.
Her whole dowry.

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:19.639
Got to work
another three, four years.

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:22.183
By then, she won't be young anymore.

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:25.617
Groom's waited 1 0 years,
counting the war.

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:28.952
The injury's nothing.
Just wants her money back.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.290
That terrible gun.

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:44.836
What is it?

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.783
What's wrong?

00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:01.184
The Colt, it was mine.

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.851
Someone stole it from me.

00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:10.131
If only I hadn't screwed up.

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:17.706
If it wasn't a Colt,
it'd have been a Browning.

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:29.117
I have an awful feeling
something worse will happen.

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:29.608
We're all set.

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:32.574
The hawkers have his picture.

00:47:32.749 --> 00:47:34.080
Well done.

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:48.730
Quite a game, huh?

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:51.330
Not again.

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.969
It's just that
something's bothering me.

00:47:54.137 --> 00:47:55.661
What's that?

00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:04.339
What?

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:07.915
That night, the perp came back
to return the gun.

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:12.821
But there I was,
busting that woman.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.820
He must have thought
I got his card, too.

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:21.829
Maybe that's why he went out
and robbed and shot that girl.

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:26.029
Hey, there now.

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:30.164
Is the perpetrator
your responsibility?

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:34.800
No, but I checked. There were
no armed assaults the night before.

00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:40.006
I mean, he'd gotten hold of the gun,
then had second thoughts.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.784
And he wanted to return it,
but then...

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:44.682
So what?

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:48.620
Instead of brooding,
prevent the next incident.

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:53.491
He stole 40,000 yen. He's bound
to run through it pretty fast.

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:56.633
And what happens
when he runs out of dough?

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.703
He'll rob again. Once does not a habit
make, but the second time,

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:05.273
a stray becomes a rabid dog.
Am I wrong?

00:49:05.409 --> 00:49:05.932
No.

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:09.341
We'll put everything we've got
into grabbing Honda.

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:13.973
He'll turn up today.
No baseball fan would miss this game.

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.851
Thank you for your patience.

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:21.149
The Giants vs. the Hawks.

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:23.020
And the lineup is...

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:25.222
How many people we got here?

00:49:25.395 --> 00:49:28.387
- 50,000 they say.
- One of 50,000, huh?

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:31.691
How 'bout some ice pops?
Sweet popsicles.

00:49:31.868 --> 00:49:33.995
Popsicles here.

00:49:34.171 --> 00:49:35.570
We'll take two.

00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:37.100
Twenty yen, please.

00:49:58.462 --> 00:49:59.793
Play ball!

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:41.997
Popsicles.
Anyone want a popsicle?

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:43.826
Gimme a popsicle.

00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:47.595
Hey, hey.

00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:51.067
Sorry, I'm all out.

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:53.837
Then why push 'em?

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.197
- Now, the hard part.
- I'll get him.

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:21.633
Don't you see anything but Honda?

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:24.966
We can't put this crowd at risk.

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:31.171
We have to assume he's armed.
And a bullet's nothing like a foul ball.

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.979
Got to get him away from the crowd.

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:35.583
But how?

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:38.448
We mull it over.
We've got five innings to go.

00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:13.650
Kawakami's coming up to bat.

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:52.450
Time for the seventh-inning stretch.

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:01.801
Only three innings to go.

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.030
Right.

00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:07.836
We have a lost child to report.

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:11.345
Calling the father
of Hiroshi Yamamoto.

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:15.006
Your son climbed onto the roof
of the announcer's booth.

00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:17.517
Please retrieve him immediately.

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:39.036
Let's give that a try.

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:41.404
Call Honda over the PA system.

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:42.636
I get it.

00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:47.539
Honda-san of Ueno.

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:50.413
Honda-san of Ueno.

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:54.023
Please come
to the main gate immediately.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:57.182
Your party will meet you there.

00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:03.062
Maybe it's pointless.

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:04.097
Let's try again.

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:07.031
Right, this time
use his real name.

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:13.471
Tachibana-san of Ueno.

00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:16.241
Tachibana-san of Ueno.

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:21.282
Please meet your party
at the main gate now.

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:22.403
Put 'em up!

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:55.567
RlCE RATlON CARD
SHlNJlRO YUSA

00:56:57.914 --> 00:57:02.180
We're lucky
Honda hadn't torn this to pieces.

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:05.719
He couldn't stand someone
having stolen his Colt.

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:07.914
He was planning his revenge.

00:57:08.124 --> 00:57:10.558
Once a thief, always a thief.

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:15.588
Good work. Now we'll go after Yusa
with everything we've got.

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:20.329
We'll track him step by step.
Who knows how long it'll take.

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:23.563
A little rain would sure help.

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:26.935
This heat dulls your instincts.

00:57:27.143 --> 00:57:31.170
I'm putting Sato-san
and Murakami on this investigation.

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:38.179
So Shinjiro Yusa is
your younger brother?

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:41.551
Yes. Has he done something?

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:44.522
He hasn't been home
for a week now.

00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:46.628
Oh, it's no big deal, really.

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:51.758
Ever since he got home from the war,
he's like a stranger.

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:54.092
The poor boy.

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:58.434
His knapsack and everything he owned
was stolen from him on the train ride home.

00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:00.074
He turned bitter.

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:02.040
You're just indulging him.

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:05.113
I can't be as hard on him
as you are.

00:58:05.281 --> 00:58:07.909
He's always blaming
the world, the war.

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:12.987
Like he's carrying all Japan's problems,
but he never lifts a finger.

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:15.724
I blame those horrible friends of his.

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:16.781
Friends?

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:21.593
There's a yakuza
who comes by sometimes.

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:27.633
You know the Regent cut?
That's how he wears his hair.

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:30.329
It's all his fault.
- What's his name?

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:33.640
He always calls him "Sei-san."

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.744
They were in the army together.

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:37.937
Do you know where he lives?

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:39.604
I wonder.

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:42.341
May we look at
your brother's things?

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:45.783
There's almost nothing to speak of.

00:58:46.089 --> 00:58:48.956
Just some junk in that box.

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:50.649
Excuse us.

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:04.304
He's a sweet, gentle kid,
but he's really too shy.

00:59:07.043 --> 00:59:08.772
Go play outside.

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:20.654
Is this where he sleeps?

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:24.020
No, he sleeps out back...

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.188
More out back?

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:30.992
No, he just bought some wood
and made it himself.

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:32.725
May we see his room?

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:37.066
I'd hardly call it a room,
it's so makeshift.

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:04.097
I wanted to look after him,
but with so many kids...

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.434
How was he
when you last saw him?

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:15.102
Let me see...

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:19.907
I remember.
It must have been the day he left.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.941
He didn't come
when dinner was ready.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:27.681
I found him sitting here
in the dark, crying,

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.552
his head in his hands.

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:33.161
He kind of scared me.

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.160
Right.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.340
Another sleepless night.

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:26.415
I hear that alley cat
crying over the rain.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.676
The one who followed me
through the storm.

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:33.185
It's only going to suffer and die.

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:37.888
Better to kill it
once and for all.

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:41.497
I still remember

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:45.464
how it felt
when I crushed it with my foot.

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:47.963
I'm a coward.

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:53.769
Just like that rain-drenched cat.

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:57.037
What's the point...

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.985
Is this your brother's writing?

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.426
And this Sakura Hotel?

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:13.721
That's right. He mentioned
his yakuza friend

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:17.594
manages that hotel,
or something like that.

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.997
I'm sure that can't be so.

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:21.363
Thank you.

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:56.696
Welcome.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.007
The manager?

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:01.575
- That's me.
- Know a man named Sei-san?

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:05.578
Sei-san's one of our bellboys.
What did he do now?

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:08.512
So, he's always up to something?

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.311
He does like his women.

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:12.784
We'd like to meet this ladies' man.

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:15.447
- Right away.
- We'll go this way.

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.696
Hey, the police are here.

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:31.204
Oh, Midori must have gone
whining to you.

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:36.204
I want you to know she knew
the score when she lent me the dough.

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:39.212
This isn't about Midori.

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:41.740
Is it about Kaori, then?

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.820
But, Officer...

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:48.956
We're not here over
your Midori or Kaori.

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:53.753
We want to know about Yusa.
Your war buddy.

01:03:56.899 --> 01:04:01.632
So they beat you up in the army.
We aren't like that.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.969
Isn't it about time
you turned off the faucet?

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:08.609
Where were we?

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:13.507
When did you last see Yusa?

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:17.585
It was Saturday night, the 1 1 th.
He turned up, loaded.

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:20.381
- Pockets full too?
- Yeah, new clothes.

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:23.252
- What kind?
- A white linen suit.

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:26.418
White linen?
Was he by himself?

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.287
He's shy around women.

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:30.898
Not everyone can be like you.

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.430
He spent the night?
- Yes.

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:35.867
- How'd he seem?
- Who knows.

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:39.338
He was broke, but suddenly
he's loaded. Isn't that odd?

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:42.972
Didn't you ask him why?
What'd he say?

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:47.878
He didn't explain anything.
He just stared ahead, looking pale.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.878
Did he pull something?

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:55.115
I hear you're the one
who led him astray.

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:58.783
But that's... Who told you that?
I just...

01:04:58.961 --> 01:05:00.656
You just what?

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:03.094
I just hung around with him some.

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:05.996
What do you get
out of a penniless vet?

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.659
- I just... We're just friends.
- Liar.

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:12.274
I'm sure all your other friends
are good for dough.

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:15.802
What do you get
out of being pals with him?

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:21.381
He's got some pull backstage
at the Bluebird. That's why.

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:24.042
Right. Women again.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.912
So you're telling me

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:32.824
you used him like a pass
to get close to those chorus girls?

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:34.796
Yes.

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:38.192
But why him?
He was broke.

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:43.135
One of the girls, Harumi Namiki,
was an old friend of his.

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:53.379
Do you have
any more questions for me?

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:59.049
We'll send a juvenile officer around.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:47.234
Which one is Harumi Namiki?

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:48.597
Second from the left.

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:28.133
Harumi.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.696
Why were you out yesterday?

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:33.835
I felt bad.

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:37.968
In this heat,
everybody feels like crap.

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:43.816
And you've got visitors.
They're police.

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:49.821
You act so innocent.
God knows what you're up to.

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.785
You're Namiki?

01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:39.664
You know

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:41.536
a guy named Yusa?

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:44.573
Yes.

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:47.178
I hear you go way back.

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:49.248
Way back?

01:09:49.418 --> 01:09:52.012
Weren't you childhood friends?

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:55.652
Friends?

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:58.726
We sat next to each other
one year at school.

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:01.362
I want the truth from you.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.464
I'm not lying.

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:26.352
Forget it. So, what's the deal
with you two these days?

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.623
The deal?

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:31.225
I mean, are you his girl?

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:33.258
It's not like that.

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:36.627
So he's just another fan?

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.059
Not that either.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:43.695
What is it, then? I hear he comes
to see you every day.

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:47.805
I can't just pack him off.
I do know him.

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.775
That's not what I'm talking about.

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:58.719
When was the last time
you saw him?

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.390
Answer.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:04.824
I'm thinking.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:07.326
You're thinking?

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:12.257
What's wrong?
Answer.

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:18.201
I haven't... done anything bad.

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:52.106
I filed a report with Headquarters.

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:59.637
We're beat.
Tomorrow's another day.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:03.680
I'll excuse myself, then.

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:06.377
I'd like you to make
one last stop with me.

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:13.592
Why do you think
that woman burst into tears?

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:18.563
Well, she's exhausted.
And so are we.

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:22.465
I shouldn't have done that.

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:26.199
When you're tired,
you run out of patience.

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:31.869
Questioning's a tricky business.

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:36.076
If you try to strong-arm 'em,
you lose. Just like Sumo.

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:39.584
I think we should give her
another try tomorrow.

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:42.189
Sure, that's fine.

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:46.250
But she's not going
to give us much.

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:51.092
That kind of high-strung girl
is as stubborn as they come.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.198
Make 'em mad
and they clam right up.

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:58.099
By the way, where are we going?

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:05.376
Hey.

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.447
Welcome home.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:10.942
You're all so hot.

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.551
How 'bout welcoming our guest?

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:15.246
Welcome.

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:17.119
I was expecting more work.

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.987
Make yourself at home.

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:20.853
Welcome home.

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:22.224
Murakami from HQ.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.229
- Pleasure's mine.
- No, mine.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.891
I apologize for the decor.

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:30.098
Go on and play in the other room.

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:33.205
Please.

01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:36.636
I remembered

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.803
we still have some rationed beer.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.672
Please.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.309
Impressive.

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:47.444
What? Those are just from
walking the beat every day.

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:51.486
Twenty-five years now
since I took home my first 1 3.5 yen.

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.821
How many shoes did I wear out?

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.987
Each citation must have a story.

01:13:56.165 --> 01:14:01.159
That's right. In a word,
I've lived through it all.

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:11.139
I invited you on a whim,
so it's slim pickings.

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:13.008
Will squash do?
- Sure.

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:32.631
As you see, my house
is just a glorified shack,

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:35.859
but Yusa's place was pretty awful.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.936
Not fit for human habitation.

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:43.737
Like they say,
"Maggots prefer filth."

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:50.644
They say there's no such thing
as a bad man.

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:53.480
Only bad situations.

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:57.887
Come to think of it,
you have to feel sorry for Yusa.

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:04.196
Oh, no. Thinking like that
won't get you anywhere as a cop.

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:09.163
It's easy to develop delusions,
chasing criminals all day.

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:14.239
We can't forget the many sheep
a lone wolf leaves wounded.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:18.011
Half those citations
were capital cases.

01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:23.742
There's no help for a cop who doesn't
believe he's protecting the masses.

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:29.888
I say leave psychoanalysis
to the detective novels.

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:34.119
I just hate them, that's all.
The bad guys are bad.

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:37.992
I just can't bring myself
to think that way yet.

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:42.028
All those years in the war,
so many men became beasts

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.196
at the slightest provocation,
over and over.

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:49.202
Right. Must be our age difference.

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:52.545
Or maybe it's the times.

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:55.076
What do they call it?

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:58.447
Ap... Aple...
- You mean après-guerre?

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:03.489
That's it. You're part of that postwar
generation. Maybe Yusa is, too.

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:06.558
You identify with Yusa too much.

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:09.058
Maybe you're right.

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:12.956
My knapsack was stolen
on my train ride home too.

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.067
I see.

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:17.399
I was half out of my mind
with rage.

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:21.142
I could have pulled off
a robbery back then.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.379
But I realized I'd hit
a dangerous crossroads,

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:28.415
deliberately chose another way,
and got myself this job.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:31.075
Hmm. Right, I see.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:36.289
It's just, in other words, aa...

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.392
Ap, aple...
- Après-guerre.

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:43.089
There are two après-guerre types:
like you or like Yusa.

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.823
You're the real thing.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.527
Yusa's an ap... ap...

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:50.466
après-nothing.

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:52.539
I'm all après-ed out.

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:01.009
And tomorrow?

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.576
What's the hurry?

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:07.279
I can't help it when I think of Yusa
running through all that cash.

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:10.453
He blew half
upgrading his duds.

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:13.090
It's been over a week now.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:19.195
That's 6,000 yen a day.
We could live on that for a month.

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:32.002
I'll be going.

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:34.972
You sure?

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.276
Tomi.

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:41.814
Our guest's leaving. Hey, Tomi.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.188
They all just fell asleep.

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:48.522
Oh, they fell asleep?

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:59.834
Take a look.

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.989
Looks like a pumpkin field.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.541
It was armed robbery?

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:16.240
Yes. The wife was known

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:18.749
as quite a beauty
around the neighborhood.

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:22.213
They were so lovey-dovey
the maids all quit.

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:26.520
The husband was out of town.
Came back this morning to this.

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:29.357
You never know

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.564
what life has in store.

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:36.332
See, it's that house
with the crape myrtle bush.

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:39.439
Crape myrtle always brings bad luck.

01:19:56.992 --> 01:20:01.292
It's really a problem.
Was it you who moved the body?

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:09.227
I was her doctor and she didn't
even like me to see her naked flesh.

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:16.103
I'm sure she wouldn't have
wanted anyone to see her that way.

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:20.109
I've known her
since she was this high.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.848
Sato-san, do you think
it was my Colt again?

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:28.854
What the hell
does it matter if it was?

01:20:58.186 --> 01:20:59.949
What's wrong?

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:07.586
My wife...
planted these tomatoes.

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:12.221
The day I left town,
they were still green.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.369
But now that I'm back,

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:19.064
they've all ripened and turned red,

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:21.937
even though my wife is dead.

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:27.545
What's the point, Officer?

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:30.977
All for a measly 50,000 yen.

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:45.924
How can I even stand
to look at them?

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:20.894
The way I imagine it...

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:24.998
Imagining only complicates
an investigation. Stick to the facts.

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:44.177
Yes, hello? Nakajima here.

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:46.877
Is this Evidence?

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.754
Right, thanks.

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:55.123
So it was one of my bullets?

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:57.457
No, it was one of Yusa's.

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:19.543
Let's go.

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:22.583
No time for despair.

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:25.885
The only way to stop this
is to arrest Yusa.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:28.552
There are five bullets
left in that gun.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.904
- A new lead?
- Where to?

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.236
Where to?
Home for beer and a nap.

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:46.244
But you're awful sneaky.
You'd never go home together.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:48.473
Just let me through.
It's so hot.

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.914
- The mark?
- I don't see a mark.

01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:52.644
Always joking.

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.091
Headed this way, I bet.

01:24:58.259 --> 01:25:01.092
- Who's headed this way?
- Who?

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:03.829
I was talking about the rain.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.801
You can't be this tense all the time
if you want to be a cop.

01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:13.065
I'm ready to collapse from anxiety.

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:16.609
The way you're talking,
you already have.

01:25:23.985 --> 01:25:27.079
This is the make-or-break point.

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:31.283
He's killed someone.
A killer's like a mad dog.

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:35.327
Do you know how a mad dog walks?

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:40.161
There's an old ditty
that's disturbingly close to home.

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:43.499
"A mad dog only sees straight paths."

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:47.100
Yusa only knows straight paths now.

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:51.576
He's in love with Harumi Namiki.
She's the only thing he sees.

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:53.974
I know he'll go to her.

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:39.051
The manager's out.

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:41.422
Can I help you?

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.504
We want to see Namiki.

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:58.704
Harumi's out today.

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:03.713
She's a real problem, that one.

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:08.215
One little comment
and she takes the day off.

01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:13.585
She's quiet all right,
but the quiet ones are always

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.320
the most stubborn.

01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:23.466
And she's sick right now.

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:25.169
She's sick?

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:29.171
With her monthlies, you know.

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:35.346
They're always impossible then.

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.852
Know her address?

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:43.014
Sure.

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:48.428
I think she lives over in Koenji.

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.995
She's a mama's girl.

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.415
We want to see your daughter.

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:25.128
- Come in.
- Thank you.

01:28:34.275 --> 01:28:36.106
We're fine here.

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:43.916
Harumi.

01:28:59.734 --> 01:29:01.599
Please don't trouble yourself.

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:35.332
I'll take a match.

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:50.383
We can definitely expect
a downpour.

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:59.185
Harumi, we'd like
to ask you something.

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:04.996
I don't know a damn thing about Yusa.
I hate cops. They're so pushy.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.592
Don't.

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:08.726
She's impossible.

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:10.831
Can it, Mom.

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:13.906
We don't have to say a thing
if we don't want to.

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:19.171
Even if you're covering up
for an armed-robbery suspect?

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:25.218
I still don't know.

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:28.480
Don't lie.
He was just here.

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:32.348
Yusa left this box of matches?

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:34.757
That's exactly right.

01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:39.494
You were just complaining
that he follows you around.

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:42.725
Do you happen to know
where he went?

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:45.395
Tell them.
I'm ordering you, tell them.

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:49.240
Harumi, you must tell them
everything you know.

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:53.039
- I don't know what I don't know.
- You really don't?

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:56.240
- I really don't know.
- You'd better not be lying about this.

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:58.408
Harumi.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.653
Listen, Harumi.

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:05.053
Why won't you tell them?
Tell them. Tell them.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.951
Harumi, listen, Harumi.

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:25.002
We're closing in.

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:27.773
I've had enough of her lip for now.

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:31.309
I'll check the hotel
these matches came from.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:32.111
And me?

01:31:32.286 --> 01:31:34.948
See if you can tough it out
in there.

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:38.558
That mother's born
to prosecute her daughter.

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:42.088
Phone downstairs?
I'll call you.

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:45.157
Say, do you have a gun?
- Yes.

01:31:45.566 --> 01:31:48.501
Afraid I left mine at home.
No holster.

01:31:54.442 --> 01:31:58.503
Yusa just left. I doubt
he'll turn up here again tonight.

01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:17.260
No more questions. Do whatever you want,
if you won't do as Mother says.

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:20.658
It's all my fault.

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:24.202
I spoiled you because
you never knew your father.

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:28.540
Go ahead.
Make a fool out of me.

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:49.660
He's in his late 20s,
wearing a white linen suit.

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:51.398
Got me.

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:03.510
They never register
under their real names.

01:33:10.384 --> 01:33:12.648
Haruo Namiki. I get it.

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:16.017
That's him, ma'am.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.927
Oh, that guy.

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:29.067
He spent two nights here,
drunk out of his mind.

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:34.471
No one ever came and met him.
Pretty gloomy, even for a drunk.

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:40.904
It was last night. He suddenly announced
he was going and called a cab.

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:42.481
Know which company?

01:33:42.683 --> 01:33:45.413
Peace Taxi,
over by the train tracks.

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:49.215
I think the driver was Matsu-san.

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:50.914
Thanks a lot.

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:54.027
- Who is he anyway?
- A mad dog.

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:16.140
Officer,

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:18.944
how long are you planning
to torment us?

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:21.614
- You're the tormentor.
- No, I'm not.

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:26.883
I don't know what that Yusa did,

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:29.824
but he's never done
anything bad to me.

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:37.303
He'd stop by backstage sometimes
and watch me mournfully.

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:42.002
I can't have any part
in arresting someone like that.

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:45.542
So you know where he is,
but you won't tell me?

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:49.008
Maybe so.

01:34:50.384 --> 01:34:54.013
Go ahead and arrest him on your own.
I won't help you.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:22.477
I'll return this, so beat it.

01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:26.748
Armed robbery, huh?

01:35:27.488 --> 01:35:30.480
No wonder he was such a big tipper.

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:32.489
Where did you take him?

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:34.958
To a geisha joint called Kogetsu.

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:36.424
Excuse me.

01:35:56.383 --> 01:36:00.114
Where would you ever get
such a dress?

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.622
He gave it to me.

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:16.731
I saw it in a shop window
when we were taking a walk.

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:25.873
I said I wished I could have
a dress that pretty just once.

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:34.420
He stared at me
with the saddest expression.

01:36:35.422 --> 01:36:38.482
A week later he brought it
to me backstage.

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:41.987
You mean, Harumi...

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:44.430
That's right.

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:48.432
He committed a crime for me.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:53.129
But I would've stolen it myself
if I'd had the guts.

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:56.371
They deserve it
for flaunting these things.

01:36:56.577 --> 01:37:01.344
We have to do worse than steal
if we want things like this.

01:37:01.682 --> 01:37:02.774
Harumi.

01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:18.730
It's the world's fault. A world
where people steal a vet's knapsack.

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:20.263
Yusa told you that?

01:37:24.038 --> 01:37:25.266
That's right.

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:28.068
But it didn't only happen to him.

01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:30.675
Me too.

01:37:37.718 --> 01:37:41.085
And, yes, I think
the world's not right.

01:37:41.288 --> 01:37:44.689
But it's worse to take it out
on the world.

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:50.422
The bad guys eat and wear anything
they want. Might as well steal.

01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:54.567
Do you really believe that?
Then why don't you steal?

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:57.635
Why don't you wear this dress?

01:37:57.771 --> 01:38:02.299
Go ahead, try it on.
Why don't you wear it?

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:10.172
- You have to work in such heat.
- No choice.

01:38:12.786 --> 01:38:14.219
Enjoy.

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:19.757
It's sake.

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:23.055
It's one way to beat the heat.

01:38:24.899 --> 01:38:26.332
Thanks.

01:38:27.268 --> 01:38:28.326
What'd he do?

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:31.563
He came late at night.

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:36.403
And he left ridiculously early
the next morning. Beyond that...

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:37.703
Who was his geisha?

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:42.713
Oh, that's right. Yes, she escorted him
as far as the street.

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:43.577
Her name?

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:47.278
Kintaro. She's one of
Wakehisamatsu's girls, right?

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:50.150
But when I called them,
she was out.

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:53.952
A popular girl.
The booker know where she went?

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:56.028
Kintaro's at a party.

01:38:56.163 --> 01:38:58.290
- Where?
- Musashiya.

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:03.229
This is wonderful.

01:39:05.472 --> 01:39:06.439
So wonderful.

01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:08.969
Like a beautiful dream.

01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:21.115
You fool.

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:27.755
Mother.

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:10.360
- You Kintaro-san?
- Yeah, that's me.

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:13.868
You'd probably look good with an ax.

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:18.845
I'm so soaked,
I'd better be funny.

01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:21.777
You had a customer
two nights ago.

01:40:21.982 --> 01:40:24.314
Two nights ago at Kogetsu?

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:27.915
Oh, I hate that kind of customer.

01:40:28.088 --> 01:40:28.884
Why?

01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:31.889
'Cause he was so damned gloomy.

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:35.354
He pull anything?
- Right.

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:38.060
You saw him off.

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:41.895
- You've done your homework.
- Where'd he go next?

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.263
Where to?

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.997
Get a hotel name or anything?

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:48.131
- Were you watching?
- Where is it?

01:40:48.675 --> 01:40:52.543
The Yayoi Hotel in Kanda.
A while ago...

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:02.880
You're a fool.

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:06.015
I'll make her talk right away.

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:11.697
I went too far.

01:41:14.068 --> 01:41:16.468
After all, this case

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:23.942
involves a pistol Yusa's carrying,

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:26.443
which someone stole from me.

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:28.578
That's why...

01:41:33.654 --> 01:41:36.646
My gun has already injured
two people.

01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:38.982
One of them's dead.

01:41:41.595 --> 01:41:46.396
And I have a terrible feeling
something else will happen tonight.

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:03.809
Welcome. You're soaked.

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:09.088
I'm with the police.
You've got a guest, Namiki?

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:12.522
Yes. Room 6, second floor.

01:42:16.897 --> 01:42:17.886
Your phone?

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:19.793
Yes, this way.

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:26.370
Please.

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:39.881
Don't tell anyone I'm a cop.

01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:45.180
Other entrances?

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:47.327
There's another around back.

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:48.256
Locked?

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:50.862
- Not yet.
- Then lock it up.

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:03.468
His wailing's driving me nuts.

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:04.577
But...

01:43:04.745 --> 01:43:08.181
Shit. Our only high roller
is a wanted man.

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:21.728
Can't you stop crying?
You're a boy.

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:27.057
That fat guy over there's a cop.

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:31.971
You don't listen to me,
he'll throw you in jail.

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:40.179
Yes, yes.

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:45.049
Send an All Points Bulletin
immediately. Okay, then.

01:44:16.483 --> 01:44:17.313
Yes?

01:44:18.785 --> 01:44:19.809
What?

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:23.086
What? That's right.

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:27.093
Murakami. What?

01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:31.689
Murakami.

01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:35.090
Can't you hear? Murakami.

01:44:35.502 --> 01:44:37.697
In Harumi Namiki's room.

01:44:38.138 --> 01:44:41.596
Oh, Harumi Namiki?

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.275
Right, right.

01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:47.477
Hello, hello.

01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:49.339
Not Namiki.
Murakami.

01:44:49.816 --> 01:44:51.909
Hello?
Not Namiki. Murakami.

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:55.011
Harumi-san, telephone.

01:45:13.307 --> 01:45:15.275
Hey, if that's Yusa...

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:17.536
Dear, if that's him...

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:19.406
What shall I say if it is?

01:45:20.747 --> 01:45:22.044
Hello!

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:36.888
Hello.

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:38.547
This is Harumi.

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:41.623
What? Sato-san?

01:46:41.795 --> 01:46:42.693
Sato-san?

01:46:42.963 --> 01:46:44.931
Hello. Murakami, please.

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:50.960
Sato-san!

01:46:51.138 --> 01:46:53.902
Hello, Sato-san!

01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:05.847
Yusa's hotel?

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:47.022
- You must get some rest.
- Leave me alone.

01:48:14.688 --> 01:48:16.383
How much blood did you give?

01:48:16.823 --> 01:48:18.256
I don't know.

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:25.562
Please, sir, tell me.

01:48:25.899 --> 01:48:29.232
Was it another bullet
from my gun?

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:40.611
Abe-san, please tell me.

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:45.383
Iwase-san.

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:13.077
Sato-san, please don't die.
I'm begging you.

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:15.373
Sato-san.

01:49:17.517 --> 01:49:19.542
Don't die.

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:23.413
Sato-san, I'm begging you.
Please live.

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:27.121
Sato-san, please live.

01:49:27.294 --> 01:49:28.625
Don't die.

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:54.617
You're still here?

01:49:54.788 --> 01:49:58.554
He's over the worst, you know.

01:50:08.101 --> 01:50:09.295
Officer.

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:11.798
Officer.

01:51:01.521 --> 01:51:04.354
Yusa's going to meet me
at 6:00 a. m. at Ohara.

01:51:04.524 --> 01:51:06.651
- What?
- He just called.

01:51:08.028 --> 01:51:09.052
I'll go too.

01:51:09.663 --> 01:51:12.655
No. He's got three bullets left.

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:08.183
Damn. Which one's Yusa?
Which one's Yusa?

01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:15.051
Don't panic.
Calm down.

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:21.324
Calm down, calm down.

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:24.130
Calm down.

01:52:26.206 --> 01:52:29.903
Twenty-eight years old.
White linen suit.

01:52:31.611 --> 01:52:35.377
Twenty-eight years old.
White linen suit.

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:51.761
What if he changed clothes?
Which means, a man in his late 20s.

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:57.732
A 28-year-old.

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:06.709
Don 't panic.

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:15.777
That's right. Yusa ran out
into the pouring rain last night.

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:19.959
Muddy shoes.

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:23.752
Muddy shoes.

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:28.959
Muddy pants, muddy pants.

01:54:23.456 --> 01:54:24.684
A lefty.

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:30.222
I gave my gun to Sato-san...

02:00:23.516 --> 02:00:27.612
Congratulations.
Hear you got a citation.

02:00:28.554 --> 02:00:29.851
Nakajima told me.

02:00:30.022 --> 02:00:32.013
Oh, no, I owe it all to you.

02:00:32.191 --> 02:00:33.180
No, no.

02:00:34.927 --> 02:00:37.487
How's it feel to get
your first citation?

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:38.756
Thank you.

02:00:39.498 --> 02:00:43.434
But it was all my fault
to begin with.

02:00:43.603 --> 02:00:46.094
You still obsessed with that Colt?

02:00:46.872 --> 02:00:49.705
But look at it this way.

02:00:50.042 --> 02:00:54.035
Your Colt netted more
than a dozen of Honda's guns.

02:00:54.213 --> 02:00:55.043
Yes.

02:00:56.415 --> 02:01:00.112
But I just can't get that Yusa
off my mind.

02:01:03.122 --> 02:01:05.989
I remember feeling that way myself.

02:01:07.526 --> 02:01:11.394
You'll always remember
your first arrest.

02:01:12.965 --> 02:01:18.801
But there's a lot more guys
like him than you realize.

02:01:19.805 --> 02:01:23.400
The more you arrest them,
the less sentimental you'll feel.

02:01:27.213 --> 02:01:30.546
That dancer.
What was her name?

02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:31.980
Harumi Namiki?

02:01:32.151 --> 02:01:33.448
That's right.

02:01:35.021 --> 02:01:37.990
I can understand her sentimentality.

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:45.094
But take a look out the window
at the world.

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:57.908
There'll be all sorts of cases
under those rooftops today.

02:01:59.111 --> 02:02:02.911
And a few good people

02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:05.847
will fall victim
to someone else like Yusa.

02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:13.984
Forget about Yusa.

02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:18.594
No, as soon as your arm heals,
you'll be busy again.

02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:22.862
You'll forget all about Yusa, naturally.

02:02:26.494 --> 02:02:32.494
THE END
