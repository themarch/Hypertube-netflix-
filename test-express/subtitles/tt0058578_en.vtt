WEBVTT

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:45.713
World in Action...

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.466
enters the struggling,

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:48.709
changing world...

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:50.531
of the seven year old.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.386
They're teddy bears,
they're not real.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.289
A Polar, look at those claws.

00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:05.743
This is no ordinary
outing to the zoo.

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:07.803
It's a very
special ocassion.

00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:11.633
We brought these twenty children
together for the very first time.

00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:16.137
They are like any
other children...

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:20.642
except that they come from
startlingly different backgrounds.

00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:24.721
No!
No feeding, it says.

00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:34.087
Stop it at once

00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:39.806
I know there's no feeding but it
doesn't really matter.

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:42.459
We brought these
children together...

00:01:43.148 --> 00:01:44.301
because we wanted a glimpse of...

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:47.506
England in the year 2000.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:54.809
The shop stewards and the executives of
the year 2000 are now seven years old.

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:58.436
Give me a child until he is seven...

00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:01.071
and I will give you the man.

00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:07.782
Let's get to know these children.

00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:11.823
Taking her little sister to school
on the London Council Estate,

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:13.891
Jackie.

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:24.904
From the Yorkshire Dales,

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:26.567
Nicholas.

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.250
He goes to a one
room village school...

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.825
four miles away from his home.

00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:40.695
From this Liverpool suburb...

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.192
We chose...

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:43.785
Neil.

00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.993
And this is Tony.

00:03:05.557 --> 00:03:08.267
His girl friend
calls him a monkey.

00:03:15.374 --> 00:03:16.804
He goes to one of
the oldest schools...

00:03:17.453 --> 00:03:19.206
in the East End of London.

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.741
Would everybody,
please sit round now?

00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:51.318
Get on with their work, I don't
want to see any backs to me.

00:03:52.593 --> 00:03:53.741
Shouldn't be anybody turning around...

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.594
Tony, do you hear as well?

00:03:57.142 --> 00:03:59.046
Next to Tony there
is his girl friend,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.277
Michelle.

00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:01.697
Tony!

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.198
Don't turn around again!

00:04:16.783 --> 00:04:19.000
In this class room,
Waltzing Matilda...

00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:21.770
is being rendered in Latin.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.713
This is an exclusive
pre-prep school...

00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:26.728
in Kensington.

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.352
I think the Beatles are mad...

00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:34.417
because they make too much noise...

00:04:34.966 --> 00:04:37.261
and their hair-style's so bad.

00:04:37.532 --> 00:04:38.884
If they composed

00:04:40.471 --> 00:04:41.935
softer music...

00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:44.397
I wouldn't mind so much.

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.357
I just loathe their hair-cuts

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.562
That was John.

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.208
If you loathe their hair-cut...

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.690
you wouldn't have liked
Henry the Fifths hair-cut.

00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:02.443
This is Charles.

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:08.489
And that is Andrew.

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:16.827
This dormetary is in
a children's home...

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:19.099
supported by charity.

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:25.701
This is Paul...

00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:31.610
and Simon.

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:37.206
I had a dream when all the
world was on top of me...

00:05:38.258 --> 00:05:42.399
and everything was on me,
and I just about got out

00:05:43.537 --> 00:05:45.368
and everything flew up in the air...

00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:48.486
and that all landed on my head.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.590
Go on Potter.

00:05:52.298 --> 00:05:53.447
If you don't now, don't go.

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:55.317
Now shoot!
- We're going to!

00:05:56.492 --> 00:06:02.159
My heart's desire is to see my daddy
who is six thousand miles away.

00:06:04.112 --> 00:06:06.076
Bruce doesn't live with
his parents either...

00:06:06.091 --> 00:06:07.323
but for a different reason.

00:06:07.832 --> 00:06:09.942
He goes to a private
boarding school in Surrey.

00:06:10.932 --> 00:06:13.282
Bruce wants to be a missionary.

00:06:13.552 --> 00:06:18.936
I think the most important thing in the
world is everyone should know about god.

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:23.174
I think we should give all... some...

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:26.045
most of our money to the poor people.

00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:35.504
In the head mistress' study...

00:06:35.775 --> 00:06:37.874
of a fashionable school for girls...

00:06:38.418 --> 00:06:40.545
we met Suzie.

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:45.768
We spoke to her "deep in the
chintz" of the staff room.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.131
Tell us, do you have
any boyfriend Suzie?

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.853
Ummm...

00:06:52.477 --> 00:06:54.721
yes!
-Tell me about him.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:07:00.451
He's up in Scotland
and I think he's thirteen.

00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:07.486
and I'm rather lonely up there
because he usually goes to school.

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:09.486
but we usually play till about...

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:13.559
half past six when he
comes home from school.

00:07:14.053 --> 00:07:15.569
Then we go in and then...

00:07:16.447 --> 00:07:18.505
he goes home to do his homework.

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:22.155
The world of the seven year old...

00:07:22.822 --> 00:07:25.130
can be primitive... even violent.

00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:01.106
What do the children themselves
think about fighting?

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:05.375
Is it important to fight? Yes!

00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:10.985
Well I feel like joining in
when there's already a fight.

00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:14.064
I always feel like that.

00:08:16.407 --> 00:08:19.401
I always feel like joining in
when there's already one.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.456
Neil from the Liverpool suburb.

00:08:23.672 --> 00:08:28.091
We don't do much fighting in school
because we think it's horrible and

00:08:28.498 --> 00:08:29.121
It hurts.

00:08:29.419 --> 00:08:34.298
Sometimes we play nice with the boys
and sometimes we argue with the boys.

00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:38.246
- Susan, Jackie's friend.
- Do you ever fight with them?
- No, just argue

00:08:38.324 --> 00:08:41.768
Most of the time we are all right.
But. one day when

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:44.296
I remember we were
all coming to school and

00:08:45.327 --> 00:08:49.750
at break time they started hitting us
and so we started to fight!

00:08:50.082 --> 00:08:53.342
so we said we're never gonna
play with you again.

00:08:53.648 --> 00:08:55.348
But we always do.

00:08:56.116 --> 00:09:03.210
If they fight me I think someone if
someone comes up and starts fighting...

00:09:03.616 --> 00:09:05.445
then I think it serves them right

00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:08.790
We play with Richard the
Lion Heart and William Tell.

00:09:09.705 --> 00:09:11.868
Well... we pretend we got swords...

00:09:12.404 --> 00:09:14.899
and then we make the
noises of the sword-fighting...

00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:18.352
and when somebody stabs us we'll go
....'aaaaaahh'!

00:09:18.985 --> 00:09:20.150
Nicholas from Yorkshire...

00:09:20.357 --> 00:09:21.361
seven this year.

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:25.098
I have quite a lot of
fun when I fight...

00:09:27.887 --> 00:09:32.644
I always like to wait till someone...
you better watch out for me...

00:09:33.034 --> 00:09:34.766
because as soon
as you're not looking...

00:09:35.135 --> 00:09:41.083
I like to dash up and put my hands
in front and hit them against your back.

00:09:41.828 --> 00:09:42.674
And on the grass...

00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:45.875
we... we play international wrestling.

00:09:46.364 --> 00:09:48.239
Yeah that's only in the
summer time though.

00:09:48.866 --> 00:09:50.725
yes summer we
can go on the grass.

00:09:50.987 --> 00:09:54.669
I just like fighting somehow.
- Yes, tell me about it.

00:09:54.882 --> 00:10:02.050
I just want to. He was in the
washroom and threw soap at me

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:06.487
I chased him in the
class and I hit him

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.177
When I was down in
the place at Kent...

00:10:09.905 --> 00:10:15.676
there was this little boy who I think
was younger than me... and...

00:10:16.938 --> 00:10:19.410
my Nanny was having
a game with him...

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:24.241
and he was a naughty boy because
he slapped me in the tummy.

00:10:25.067 --> 00:10:27.672
Some boys can be nice and
others can be horrible.

00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:30.930
And then he slapped Nanny...

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.690
and I didn't like
that kind of boys.

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:37.392
Jacqueline, what do you think
about boys fighting?

00:10:37.748 --> 00:10:40.655
Well... its really silly
to fight because...

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:45.906
if you fight and Miss comes in the
class-room then you only get told off

00:10:46.595 --> 00:10:48.954
I think discipline is fair enough.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.989
Farmer is the sergeant and he is quite
a good one, last term he wasn't...

00:10:54.665 --> 00:10:55.929
He had a cold

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.779
and he didn't want to wear his
voice out from shouting.

00:11:08.689 --> 00:11:12.604
And that's Farmer.
He gives me nightmares.

00:11:42.748 --> 00:11:45.373
The vast majority of the seven years
olds know little of discipline.

00:11:46.558 --> 00:11:48.359
But a few, from the
moment they are born...

00:11:48.814 --> 00:11:50.143
are trained to accept it.

00:11:52.147 --> 00:11:54.120
squad steady

00:11:55.345 --> 00:11:57.972
squad left foot
in one place

00:11:59.248 --> 00:12:01.374
squad breathe in

00:12:17.373 --> 00:12:20.112
Well I don't like

00:12:20.894 --> 00:12:23.906
the big boys
hitting us

00:12:24.249 --> 00:12:29.673
The prefects sending us
out for nothing. And they

00:12:30.067 --> 00:12:32.832
the staff in washroom
sends the nurse out

00:12:33.442 --> 00:12:37.065
where there is no talking, no
I wasn't talking today...

00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:39.533
and Brown set me up for nothing.

00:12:40.546 --> 00:12:43.498
I think the system
of having House Captains...

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.698
is rather good because when
somebody's naughty

00:12:48.324 --> 00:12:54.573
the House Captain asks him and...
and... and has a talk to him.

00:12:55.578 --> 00:12:58.422
Once I had a talk to Gravel
he was in my house...

00:13:00.097 --> 00:13:05.423
and...and I asked Sir he could put
him out of my house because...

00:13:05.523 --> 00:13:07.623
he was always getting minuses.

00:13:08.816 --> 00:13:10.095
What did the sir say?
-Yes.

00:13:10.375 --> 00:13:11.930
The sir said that he was...

00:13:12.394 --> 00:13:15.679
he... we would see
about it this term.

00:13:16.912 --> 00:13:18.907
Well... I think
it's a very good system.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.672
And you had to
speak to anyone?

00:13:20.772 --> 00:13:22.612
Just because you
are one, I suppose.

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:24.719
No, no,
I haven't.

00:13:25.283 --> 00:13:26.002
You're not
are you?

00:13:26.283 --> 00:13:30.523
But I am. Straull Meckanace.
got three minuses in a day.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.538
He is
a pest.

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:36.070
You think, House Captain should be
elected or appointed by sir?

00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:37.164
Appointed.

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:38.392
Appointed

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:40.479
I think its more
fair to have elected.

00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:43.626
Yes. So do I but I think it is best
to be appointed. -Because you didn't...

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:46.158
It saves lot of time.
-It doesn't!

00:13:46.585 --> 00:13:47.407
Appointed!

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:51.019
It is much easier because all
that you have to do is...

00:13:51.237 --> 00:13:53.888
count up the pluses and here
you are.  -Yes!

00:13:55.676 --> 00:13:56.473
At Suzie's
school...

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.579
the exercise
is classical ballet.

00:14:09.327 --> 00:14:10.421
For Neil and
his classmates...

00:14:10.845 --> 00:14:12.771
its free
movement to music.

00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:27.196
Michelle and her friends are
left to amuse themselves.

00:14:34.505 --> 00:14:40.361
This distinction between freedom and
discipline is the key to their whole future.

00:15:15.177 --> 00:15:16.488
What about after school?

00:15:17.547 --> 00:15:19.657
What do they do
in their spare time?

00:15:21.239 --> 00:15:23.250
When I've gone
home, I have tea.

00:15:23.898 --> 00:15:26.206
Then I practice my piano.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.494
And then I
practice my recorder.

00:15:30.604 --> 00:15:33.052
Then I start
watching television.

00:15:34.378 --> 00:15:35.643
What time do you go to bed?

00:15:36.074 --> 00:15:38.929
When I have my
bath at six o'clock...

00:15:40.258 --> 00:15:44.410
and then go to bed at seven and
read till half past seven.

00:15:45.022 --> 00:15:49.127
I usually go to bed at ten o'clock
or eleven o'clock.

00:15:50.386 --> 00:15:51.583
When I go home...

00:15:52.507 --> 00:15:53.933
I go and see my mother...

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:57.075
and I have tea
and watch t.v....

00:16:01.156 --> 00:16:06.664
and then I... I do my homework and
then I go and see my father.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.381
And then what
time do you go to bed?

00:16:13.121 --> 00:16:15.756
last night I didn't go
to bed until seven.

00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:18.759
When I go home, I come...

00:16:19.174 --> 00:16:21.904
I come in and mummy
gives me a cup of tea...

00:16:22.437 --> 00:16:23.924
and then I go
out and play.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.731
And when it
starts to get dark...

00:16:27.193 --> 00:16:29.733
I come in again and put on t.v.

00:17:08.016 --> 00:17:14.551
I am the only child in the village
except for my baby brother.

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:18.199
he was one last Friday...

00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:21.304
I mean the friday
before last Friday...

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:29.244
Neil from Liverpool,

00:17:29.568 --> 00:17:32.392
said he prefered
living in town.

00:17:33.054 --> 00:17:35.665
Because in the winter, if
you lived in the country...

00:17:36.244 --> 00:17:39.634
it would be just all be wet and there
wouldn't be anything for miles around

00:17:40.997 --> 00:17:46.387
And you get soaked if you try to go out
and there's no shelter anywhere...

00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:47.824
except in your own house.

00:17:48.088 --> 00:17:49.830
But in the town
you can go out on...

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.363
wet, wintery days because you
can always find somewhere to shelter...

00:17:53.593 --> 00:17:55.607
because there
are lots of places.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.127
They'd like to come out for a holiday
in the country when we like...

00:18:00.689 --> 00:18:03.763
when I like the
holiday in the town.

00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:17.767
In Tony and
Michelle's school...

00:18:18.154 --> 00:18:18.847
unlike others...

00:18:19.272 --> 00:18:21.368
boys and girls are brought
together in the class room.

00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:25.839
And they meet quite naturally in the
cinema queue on Saturday morning.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.269
Sometime on Saturday
mornings I go to the cinema

00:18:51.346 --> 00:18:54.207
Sometime with my friends
and sometimes with him.

00:18:55.242 --> 00:18:56.711
You don't!
- I do!

00:18:56.912 --> 00:18:58.633
she doesn't

00:18:59.168 --> 00:19:01.400
I don’t always see you

00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:05.874
you go to a different cinema

00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:10.008
last week i went to
the.....where you go

00:19:10.527 --> 00:19:11.724
yeah but i didn't go

00:19:13.551 --> 00:19:16.553
How much does mixing or
segregating the sexes matter?

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:20.791
What effect does it have on what
boys and girls think about each other?

00:19:21.432 --> 00:19:23.819
will it influence their chances
of love and marriage?

00:19:24.586 --> 00:19:27.233
We asked the children what they
thought about the opposite sex.

00:19:28.531 --> 00:19:30.292
Tell me do you
have any girlfriends?

00:19:30.895 --> 00:19:32.182
Well... not many.

00:19:32.869 --> 00:19:33.856
What do you think about girls?

00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:35.975
well not much.

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:37.824
I don’t think much of girls.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.087
Touch a boy, kiss a boy.

00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:42.793
Sometimes we get
our own back and say...

00:19:42.995 --> 00:19:44.613
catch a girl and kiss a girl.

00:19:45.263 --> 00:19:46.003
Yeah

00:19:46.653 --> 00:19:47.530
And what was that?

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.160
The girls are always screaming.
-Yeah

00:19:51.532 --> 00:19:52.969
When we catch them,

00:19:53.844 --> 00:19:55.571
we kiss them,
-Yes.

00:19:55.848 --> 00:19:59.567
And when its catch a boy, kiss a boy
when the girls catch us, they kiss us..

00:20:00.167 --> 00:20:01.589
they say 'aaaaah'...
-Yeah.

00:20:01.906 --> 00:20:03.173
but much louder though.

00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:06.448
If we did...
all love Jeffrey

00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:08.486
we all want to marry.
- Yeah.

00:20:08.751 --> 00:20:13.798
I think I know the one that
he likes best and that's her.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.283
Susan most of
all likes Lesley

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.731
She told me before.
-Do I?

00:20:18.831 --> 00:20:22.570
You said, she keeps
changing her mind though

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.461
Yeah! I don't know
which one really

00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:29.421
Well, my girlfriend
is in Africa...

00:20:29.663 --> 00:20:33.321
and  I don't think I have another
chance of seeing her again...

00:20:34.214 --> 00:20:39.341
and there were two in Switzerland which
I liked too in a hotel, Park Hotel.

00:20:40.714 --> 00:20:42.570
Well, I know he is hers...

00:20:43.133 --> 00:20:44.434
He loves her.

00:20:44.892 --> 00:20:46.521
I don't, I love him.

00:20:48.675 --> 00:20:49.622
And these two...

00:20:50.053 --> 00:20:51.290
I love you, I love Christopher

00:20:52.152 --> 00:20:55.145
See, he loves Suzan
because Suzan loves him.

00:20:55.853 --> 00:20:58.765
He loves Lindsay and Lindsay loves him.
-I don't love him

00:20:59.101 --> 00:21:02.082
once Caroline Tetford said

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.483
She loved me.
-And what happened after that?

00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:10.099
And I am going to marry...
I marry her when I grow up.

00:21:12.002 --> 00:21:15.182
I hate her. She's always getting
bad tempered and cross with me.

00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:16.218
Is she?

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:21.574
Yes! Neil Hughes! Move your desk forward
and sometimes... and sometimes...

00:21:22.861 --> 00:21:26.834
when...when she is supposed to have
the chair on the back of the desk...

00:21:26.934 --> 00:21:30.089
and when I take it...
when I put it back...

00:21:30.189 --> 00:21:32.564
she says, 'Neil Hughes!' take
your chair forward.

00:21:32.664 --> 00:21:36.058
And she just gets into a girly
cross with me like that.

00:21:36.539 --> 00:21:38.931
I'd like to get
married when I grow up.

00:21:40.688 --> 00:21:43.809
But I don't know what sort of
boy but I think one...

00:21:48.703 --> 00:21:51.406
thats not got
lot of money but is...

00:21:51.898 --> 00:21:55.083
has got some money.
Not a lot though!

00:21:55.578 --> 00:21:57.908
Would you like
to get married Paul?

00:21:58.008 --> 00:22:00.015
Tell me why not!

00:22:02.037 --> 00:22:06.878
I don't like it. Say... say
you had a wife...

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:12.157
Say... say you have to eat
what they cooked you

00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:16.205
And say I don't
like greens well I don't...

00:22:18.126 --> 00:22:23.321
And say... she says you have to eat
what you're given... so...

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:28.541
I don't like greens so if she gives
me greens then... then that's it

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.150
When I get married I don't
want to have any children...

00:22:32.675 --> 00:22:36.873
Because they are always
doing naughty things and...

00:22:37.353 --> 00:22:39.247
making the
whole house untidy.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.651
When I get married I will
like to have two children.

00:22:43.702 --> 00:22:47.294
You'll have Nanny to look after
but you won't look after them?

00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:54.615
No I want a
Nanny to look after them.

00:22:55.258 --> 00:23:00.118
If I could I would have two girls
and two boys.  -Yes so would I

00:23:00.576 --> 00:23:01.776
And what about you Jackie?

00:23:02.301 --> 00:23:05.668
My Mom because she got five
girls she had seven years bad luck

00:23:06.229 --> 00:23:09.522
and seven years is a bad luck
thats why she has got five girls.

00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:14.659
And so... when my baby was
supposed to be born...

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:17.447
and we all wished
it was a boy but...

00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:20.866
But we were all waiting in my nans
for my dad 'cause he visited her

00:23:21.874 --> 00:23:24.989
he came home and said
"it's another girl kids"

00:23:25.265 --> 00:23:27.140
we all said "awwwww!"

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.757
What do you think about
girl friends at your age?

00:23:30.859 --> 00:23:33.435
I've got one but I
don't think much of her.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.926
No but I said that when
boys go around with girls...

00:23:38.277 --> 00:23:40.499
they don't pay attention
to what they're doing.

00:23:40.935 --> 00:23:43.032
My Grand mother had
an accident because...

00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:47.315
a boy friend was kissing... his
girl friend in the street.

00:23:48.024 --> 00:23:52.609
The girls never... never... never
do what the boys want them.

00:23:53.025 --> 00:23:55.462
They always start
playing with dolls...

00:23:55.744 --> 00:23:59.490
when boys want to play rough and tumble.
-It's not true!

00:24:00.075 --> 00:24:04.582
They're rather boring you never get a
chance to play with them and things like

00:24:04.793 --> 00:24:05.669
rough and tumble...

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.574
And they always start
playing with their dolls.

00:24:09.123 --> 00:24:11.887
Yes... as soon as you start...
-and silly things like that...

00:24:12.172 --> 00:24:16.741
Only intelligent girls start playing with
you -and they always take you away...

00:24:16.841 --> 00:24:19.804
from whatever game
you are playing yourself.

00:24:19.904 --> 00:24:23.330
Yes! They say `I don't want to
play that game with you...'

00:24:23.682 --> 00:24:25.395
and they don't stop crying.
- Yes!

00:24:25.645 --> 00:24:26.877
Do you have a girl friend?

00:24:31.566 --> 00:24:33.686
I don't want to answer that.

00:24:34.204 --> 00:24:38.226
I don't want to answer
those kinds of questions.

00:24:39.397 --> 00:24:41.190
They Love.
-That's right!

00:24:41.472 --> 00:24:42.816
Back to love, 'amo'.

00:24:43.174 --> 00:24:46.418
Now let's have the
present tense of 'amo'.

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.108
Amos, amas, amant...

00:24:48.482 --> 00:24:50.016
anamus, amatis, amant.

00:24:50.295 --> 00:24:54.056
Yes, What's the last one?

00:24:55.283 --> 00:24:57.048
Amant!
-Amant.

00:24:57.639 --> 00:24:59.492
Fill up the gaps on
the board there

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.086
Have a little chalk?
-Yeah

00:25:02.027 --> 00:25:05.928
In your best writing please. All right!

00:25:12.569 --> 00:25:18.054
What's Major... what's
'amatis' mean?

00:25:20.857 --> 00:25:21.720
We love.

00:25:22.751 --> 00:25:26.380
No, Holden. Amatis?

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.671
You love.
-You love! Second person, isn't it?

00:25:30.394 --> 00:25:30.892
Yes sir.

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:33.465
That was silly wasn't it

00:25:34.548 --> 00:25:39.775
Now then Russell, let's hear
the present tense of 'porto'.

00:25:40.693 --> 00:25:42.724
Porto, portas, portat,

00:25:43.117 --> 00:25:46.726
portamus, portatis, portant.
-That's right!

00:25:47.263 --> 00:25:50.322
Holden, let's hear the
present tense of 'evasto'.

00:25:51.127 --> 00:25:55.535
Evasto, evastas... evastat,

00:25:56.133 --> 00:25:59.171
evastamus, evastatis. evastant.

00:25:59.688 --> 00:26:00.532
Yes, speak up.

00:26:00.782 --> 00:26:03.159
Now let's... what does `evasto' mean?

00:26:05.566 --> 00:26:06.539
I...

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.401
All right, let's...

00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:12.589
Well, got it?
- Lay waste.

00:26:12.689 --> 00:26:15.124
`Evasto'- to lay waste!

00:26:49.257 --> 00:26:50.008
All right.

00:26:51.637 --> 00:26:53.167
All right you can talk again.

00:27:08.072 --> 00:27:12.941
Are the children themselves aware of
differences between rich and poor?

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.006
have they learned prejudice.

00:27:16.499 --> 00:27:19.123
What do they think about money?

00:27:19.835 --> 00:27:22.552
I think it's not a bad idea
to pay for schools...

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.034
becasue if we didn't...

00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:27.160
schools would be so
nasty and crowded.

00:27:28.034 --> 00:27:29.632
Yes.
-So do I think so.

00:27:29.969 --> 00:27:30.290
Yes!

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:35.091
And... people in the schools wouldn't
-And poor people would come rushing in

00:27:35.485 --> 00:27:37.921
The man, in charge of the school...

00:27:38.372 --> 00:27:41.179
would get very angry
because he would...

00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:44.147
And he would get bankrupt.
-because he wouldn't...

00:27:44.398 --> 00:27:47.824
He wouldn't be able to pay all the
masters if he didn't get any money.

00:27:48.163 --> 00:27:50.790
Yes. I think he would get
bankrupt because paying all the...

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.434
What does bankrupt mean?

00:27:52.534 --> 00:27:54.482
Having no more money
and go to prison

00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.184
Why do you have to go
to prison? That's strong!

00:27:57.551 --> 00:28:01.172
Because that obviously means
you've been spending it too much.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.598
I've got twenty three three penny pieces...

00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:08.060
and I don't know how many
half penny pieces I've got now

00:28:08.544 --> 00:28:10.676
I read The Financial Times.

00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:13.911
I read Observer and The Times.

00:28:14.369 --> 00:28:15.883
What do you like about it?

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:17.521
Well, I like...

00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:20.165
I usually look at the
headlines then read...

00:28:21.018 --> 00:28:23.914
about them... about it.

00:28:25.425 --> 00:28:28.828
I like my newspaper because I
got shares in it

00:28:28.928 --> 00:28:33.402
and I know everyday what shares are
-The stuff misers like you like

00:28:33.621 --> 00:28:34.162
No. But...

00:28:34.262 --> 00:28:38.157
on Mondays they don't
move up so I don't look at it.

00:28:38.522 --> 00:28:42.677
What would you do if you have lots
of money, about say... two pounds?

00:28:42.777 --> 00:28:43.554
Me?

00:28:44.302 --> 00:28:45.929
I would help the poor.

00:28:46.298 --> 00:28:50.548
Yeah because the poor if you
don't help them they would die

00:28:50.964 --> 00:28:52.127
Wouldn't they?

00:28:52.892 --> 00:28:56.854
And everytime we've a harvest
festival, we send them food.

00:28:57.303 --> 00:29:04.720
Once these two, no Susan and Janet
went round giving food out

00:29:04.962 --> 00:29:07.197
What do you think about rich people?

00:29:07.761 --> 00:29:10.659
Well... not much.

00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.895
Tell me about them

00:29:13.122 --> 00:29:14.902
Well, they think they
can do everything...

00:29:15.002 --> 00:29:18.859
without you doing it as well and
they think just because they're rich...

00:29:18.959 --> 00:29:21.151
and they have to have people

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:24.965
like they have to do
all their work and stuff.

00:29:25.449 --> 00:29:26.971
I don't think much of the accents.

00:29:27.473 --> 00:29:29.631
Neither do I.
-Neither do I.

00:29:29.866 --> 00:29:32.606
That doesn't prevent me liking them.

00:29:32.706 --> 00:29:36.259
Poor children, they boast
about themselves. - No they don't.

00:29:36.604 --> 00:29:41.604
Rich children boast about themselves and
say how clever I am and things like that

00:29:41.704 --> 00:29:46.191
Yes, and rich children always
make fun of poor children, I hate.

00:29:46.418 --> 00:29:51.396
Yes. -Yes they say, look at that lovely
little sissy and they laugh at them.

00:29:51.496 --> 00:29:53.163
Yes, and they throw things at them.

00:29:53.263 --> 00:29:54.104
Yes.

00:29:54.204 --> 00:29:56.182
And poor child gets scared to death.

00:29:56.499 --> 00:29:57.250
The posh ones

00:29:57.638 --> 00:29:59.940
Oh Yes. Oh yes. Oh Yes.

00:30:01.037 --> 00:30:02.523
They're nuts!

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:04.341
you just have to touch them

00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:09.269
Jacqueline, what do you
think about coloured people?

00:30:09.622 --> 00:30:15.157
You said to me once that you like them
but what do you really think about them?

00:30:15.257 --> 00:30:19.114
Well, they're nice and its
as same as us really...

00:30:19.214 --> 00:30:20.843
but one thing...

00:30:21.441 --> 00:30:25.373
it's only because their skin is
brown and we're white...

00:30:25.581 --> 00:30:26.926
sort of pinkish we're.

00:30:27.637 --> 00:30:30.588
Some people from Africa come here...

00:30:30.688 --> 00:30:34.795
but when they go, they
put their clothes on

00:30:35.157 --> 00:30:39.947
I've only seen them on
television and places like that.

00:30:40.198 --> 00:30:43.241
I don't... I don't know
anybody who is coloured.

00:30:44.872 --> 00:30:49.402
I don't want to know anybody who is
coloured. Thank you very much!

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.852
Coloured people. I don't
like them very much.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.055
No... it sounds like
ghostly coloured people.

00:30:57.155 --> 00:30:59.576
Do you think of a purple person...

00:30:59.676 --> 00:31:00.909
with red eyes,

00:31:01.189 --> 00:31:02.053
yellow feet and...

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:07.047
I can't really think of
what they really look like.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.913
They are just same as me, aren't they?

00:31:24.137 --> 00:31:26.158
What do they think
about each other?

00:31:26.258 --> 00:31:28.256
And how'll they act together?

00:31:28.807 --> 00:31:31.278
To find out, we invited
them all to one big party...

00:31:31.568 --> 00:31:32.979
and joined in

00:32:17.744 --> 00:32:20.665
Tell me what did you
three think about...

00:32:20.868 --> 00:32:22.751
the other children
that you met today...

00:32:22.851 --> 00:32:24.680
and all that, there were
quite varieties?

00:32:24.888 --> 00:32:28.217
Yes but they were bit
too tough for my liking.

00:32:28.624 --> 00:32:32.241
Some hit me right in the back and
I 've still got some pain there.

00:32:32.645 --> 00:32:37.284
And well, some of them
were rather dirty.

00:32:37.977 --> 00:32:41.861
what did you think about them?
-I played with them quiet naturally.

00:32:42.282 --> 00:32:44.764
I think they were rather nice, really.

00:32:45.249 --> 00:32:46.569
I don't like the boys.

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:50.895
Those three,  I don’t like
all of them. None of them.

00:32:50.995 --> 00:32:52.086
What about the girls?

00:32:52.558 --> 00:32:54.763
Yeah, I liked that girl...

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.423
but not the boys.

00:32:58.523 --> 00:32:59.325
Why?

00:33:00.043 --> 00:33:05.960
Because once I pulled his scarf he said,
'Don't you pull my scarf' and I hate him

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.181
And when we were at that park...

00:33:08.281 --> 00:33:10.800
he went round punching everybody.

00:33:12.575 --> 00:33:15.566
If some of our children didn't
get on with each other...

00:33:15.843 --> 00:33:17.696
does it really matter?

00:33:17.925 --> 00:33:18.704
After all...

00:33:18.804 --> 00:33:20.869
they're not likely to meet
in the same class room.

00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:23.534
At the Kensington school...

00:33:23.846 --> 00:33:27.893
all the boys are being prepared for
public school places and universities...

00:33:29.679 --> 00:33:32.924
whereas of these thirty children
getting their milk from Tony.

00:33:33.353 --> 00:33:36.849
Only, three are likely to win a
place at a grammer school.

00:33:37.545 --> 00:33:40.129
Indeed, the vast
majority will leave school...

00:33:40.748 --> 00:33:43.125
and start work at fifteen.

00:33:53.526 --> 00:33:56.216
What plans do the
children themselves have?

00:33:56.752 --> 00:34:02.039
When I leave the school, I'm
going to College Court...

00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:09.290
and then I would be going to Westminster
Boarding School if I pass the exam.

00:34:10.192 --> 00:34:15.501
Then we think, I am going
to Cambridge and Trinity Hall.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:17.849
What does university mean?

00:34:19.728 --> 00:34:20.577
Well...

00:34:21.531 --> 00:34:24.992
before I'm old enough to get a job

00:34:25.783 --> 00:34:29.845
I'll just walk around
and see what I can find.

00:34:30.496 --> 00:34:35.996
When I leave the school, I go
to Broadstairs, St. Peter's Court.

00:34:36.243 --> 00:34:40.361
And after that I'm
going to Charter House.

00:34:41.047 --> 00:34:46.815
And after that Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

00:34:47.266 --> 00:34:49.412
I like to be like Kathy Kirby

00:34:49.709 --> 00:34:53.407
I want to be a jockey when I grow up. Ya
I want to be a jockey when I grow up.

00:34:54.035 --> 00:34:55.251
When I leave school...

00:34:55.705 --> 00:34:57.957
I'm going to the Dragon School...

00:34:58.333 --> 00:34:59.235
I might.

00:35:00.954 --> 00:35:05.376
I might go to Charles
House, Marlborough

00:35:06.284 --> 00:35:07.044
And...

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:14.018
I can't.... remember
all other places...

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.919
because mummy has got so many
places... and those're some of them.

00:35:18.135 --> 00:35:19.729
What about university Charles?

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.007
I might go to Oxford.

00:35:22.896 --> 00:35:23.669
Well...

00:35:24.897 --> 00:35:28.774
I don't think I need to go to university
'cause  I'm not gonna be a teacher.

00:35:29.181 --> 00:35:33.124
I don't think you want to go to
university if you want to be an astronaut

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.186
When I grow up, I want
to be an astronaut but...

00:35:36.456 --> 00:35:40.712
if I can't be an astonaut
I think I'll be a coach driver.

00:35:40.939 --> 00:35:42.449
Tell me about the coach driver.

00:35:42.549 --> 00:35:44.627
Well, I'm going to take
people to the country...

00:35:45.423 --> 00:35:47.686
and sometimes take them
to the sea-side and...

00:35:48.942 --> 00:35:53.786
And I'll have a big loud speaker on the
coach and tell them where about we're...

00:35:54.101 --> 00:35:55.819
and what we're going to do.

00:35:56.795 --> 00:35:58.400
And what's the name of the road is.

00:35:59.198 --> 00:36:00.455
All about that.

00:36:00.933 --> 00:36:03.361
When... if I can't be an astonaut
I would like to be a...

00:36:04.543 --> 00:36:07.017
a bridal sergeant
in the police force...

00:36:07.317 --> 00:36:08.360
like my dad is.

00:36:08.661 --> 00:36:10.210
I was gonna be a policeman but...

00:36:10.787 --> 00:36:14.183
how thought how hard
it would be to join in.

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:16.034
When I leave the school,

00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:21.832
I'm down for Heathfield and
Southfield Manor and then maybe,

00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:25.189
I may want to go to a university...

00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:26.798
but I don't know which one yet.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:31.030
I'll buy myself a nice new
made house you know.

00:36:31.712 --> 00:36:34.188
one that’s all nice and comfy.

00:36:34.808 --> 00:36:36.765
I am going to work in Woolworths

00:36:37.312 --> 00:36:43.331
When I grow up I like to find out
all about the moon and all that.

00:36:43.658 --> 00:36:45.705
Well, going to Africa...

00:36:46.446 --> 00:36:48.457
and try and teach people...

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:50.946
who are not civilized...

00:36:51.191 --> 00:36:54.244
to be more or less good.

00:37:05.205 --> 00:37:08.103
At the end of their very
special day in London...

00:37:08.341 --> 00:37:10.863
after their trip to the
zoo and the party...

00:37:11.404 --> 00:37:14.345
we took our children to
an adventure play ground...

00:37:14.445 --> 00:37:17.305
where they could do
just what they like.

00:37:19.082 --> 00:37:23.279
There's from a children's home
set about building a house.

00:37:38.323 --> 00:37:40.082
That's Nicholas.

00:37:41.463 --> 00:37:43.367
And Tony.

00:38:09.701 --> 00:38:11.502
Andrew.

00:38:11.721 --> 00:38:13.440
And Bruce.

00:38:23.811 --> 00:38:25.469
John.

00:38:29.178 --> 00:38:30.932
Suzie.

00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:34.344
Jackie and her friends.

00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:43.250
Give me a child until he is seven...

00:38:43.495 --> 00:38:45.255
and I will give you the man.

00:38:54.469 --> 00:38:57.921
This has been a glimpse
of Britain's future.
