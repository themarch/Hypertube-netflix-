00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:04.090
Previously on Teen Wolf.

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:05.258
It was too dark to see much,

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.347
but I'm pretty sure it was a wolf.

00:00:06.348 --> 00:00:07.810
Is this a party or a date?

00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:08.692
Maybe both.

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:09.525
And her name is?

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:10.525
Allison.

00:00:10.526 --> 00:00:12.239
Everything in my life is somehow perfect.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.509
Why are you trying to ruin it?

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.658
You're cursed, Scott.

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.425
You want to be a little
high school amateur?

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:19.740
Or do you want to go pro?

00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:23.482
A wolf could chase down its prey,

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:25.957
hobbling it by tearing at the ankles.

00:00:27.692 --> 00:00:29.692
You know, you've got everyone
thinking everything's fine and

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:31.725
normal about you, but don't
think for a second I've given

00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:33.725
up on finding out what
your little secret is.

00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:36.290
Jackson, if you need to
leave early for any reason,

00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:37.325
you let me know.

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:40.157
You think he's the Alpha?

00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:41.358
We're about to find out.

00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:49.686
Lock it, lock it!

00:00:49.687 --> 00:00:50.867
Do I look like I have a key?

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:51.737
Grab something!

00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:52.866
- What?
- Anything!

00:01:02.158 --> 00:01:03.602
- No.
- Yes.

00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:05.075
Stiles, no, don't.

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:23.139
Come back, come back!

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.213
Stiles!

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.599
Where is it?

00:01:43.796 --> 00:01:45.243
Where'd it go?

00:01:57.796 --> 00:02:00.161
That won't hold, will it?

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:01.796
Probably not.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.828
The desk.

00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:17.495
Shh, stop, stop.

00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:19.850
The door's not gonna keep it out.

00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:21.041
- I know.
- I hate your boss.

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:21.651
What?

00:02:21.652 --> 00:02:22.651
Deaton, the Alpha?

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:23.551
Your boss.

00:02:23.552 --> 00:02:26.362
- No.
- Yes, murdering psycho werewolf.

00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:27.117
They can't be.

00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:28.117
Oh, come on.

00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:30.284
He disappears, and that thing
shows up ten seconds later to

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:32.184
toss Derek 20 feet through the air?

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.577
That's not convenient timing?

00:02:33.578 --> 00:02:34.212
It's not him.

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:35.178
He killed Derek.

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.115
No, Derek's not dead.

00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:37.001
He can't be dead.

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:38.723
Blood spurted out of his mouth, okay?

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:41.016
That doesn't exactly
qualify as a minor injury.

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:42.017
He's dead, and we're next.

00:02:42.018 --> 00:02:44.049
Okay, just...

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.250
What do we do?

00:02:47.017 --> 00:02:49.299
We get to my jeep, we get out of here,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.791
you seriously think about
quitting your job, good?

00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:58.716
No, they don't open.
The school's climate-controlled.

00:02:58.717 --> 00:02:59.584
Then we break it.

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.783
Which will make a lot of noise.

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:05.826
Then we run really fast.

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:12.749
Really fast.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.750
Stiles, what's wrong with the

00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:14.584
hood of your jeep?

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:15.417
What do you mean?

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:16.250
Nothing's wrong.

00:03:16.251 --> 00:03:17.425
It's bent.

00:03:18.116 --> 00:03:18.985
Dented?

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.183
No, I mean bent.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.128
What the hell ha--

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:42.316
That's my battery.

00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:44.149
Don't. We have to move.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.324
He could be right outside.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.715
He is right outside.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.725
Just let me take a look.

00:04:01.028 --> 00:04:02.323
Anything?
No.

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:05.519
Move now?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.495
Move now.

00:04:13.228 --> 00:04:14.128
This way.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.219
- No, no, no, no.
- What?

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.339
Somewhere without windows.

00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:18.700
Every single room in this
building has windows.

00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:20.079
Or somewhere with less windows.

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.476
The locker room.

00:04:23.632 --> 00:04:24.850
Yeah. Okay.

00:04:31.232 --> 00:04:32.464
Call your dad.

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:33.371
And tell him what?

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:34.720
I don't know, anything.

00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:37.164
Gas leak, a fire, whatever.

00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:38.033
If that thing sees the parking

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:39.563
lot filled with cop cars, it'll take off.

00:04:39.564 --> 00:04:40.621
What if it doesn't?

00:04:40.622 --> 00:04:43.054
What if it goes completely terminator
and kills every cop in sight,

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:44.195
including my dad?

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:45.702
They have guns.

00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:47.462
Yeah, and Derek had to be
shot with a wolfsbane-laced

00:04:47.463 --> 00:04:50.234
bullet to even slow him
down, you remember that?

00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:53.334
Then we...We have to...

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.103
We have to find a way out
and just run for it.

00:04:55.104 --> 00:04:56.684
There's nothing near the
school for at least a mile.

00:04:56.685 --> 00:04:58.397
What about Derek's car?

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:00.211
That could work.

00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:02.384
We go outside, we get
the keys off his body,

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.284
ugh, and then we take his car.

00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:05.812
And him.

00:05:05.813 --> 00:05:07.552
Fine. Whatever.

00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:16.769
I think I heard something.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.602
Like what?

00:05:17.603 --> 00:05:21.135
Shh, quiet.

00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:30.175
Hide.

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:35.032
No, no, Stiles. No.

00:06:06.268 --> 00:06:07.468
Ah! Oh!

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:08.301
Shh.

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:09.569
- Son of a bitch!
- Quiet!

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.541
Quiet my ass, what the hell

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:11.698
are you trying to do, kill me?

00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:12.699
Both of you get out.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.637
Just listen for half a second, okay?

00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:15.446
Not okay.

00:06:15.447 --> 00:06:16.866
Get the hell out of here right now.

00:06:18.974 --> 00:06:20.425
God, just one second to explain.

00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:21.566
Just shut up and go.

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:22.531
Ah!

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:32.003
No, no.

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.105
Lydia says we're coming to get you.

00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:47.002
Please don't.

00:06:47.003 --> 00:06:48.337
I'm sure he's on his way.

00:06:48.338 --> 00:06:52.169
He's only...26 minutes late.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.269
You here that?

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.638
First it's "He's only 26 minutes late,"

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.859
a month later it's "He only
hits me when he's drunk."

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.111
Slippery slope, Allison.

00:06:59.112 --> 00:06:59.832
Slippery slope.

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:00.532
We're picking you up.

00:07:00.533 --> 00:07:01.482
No.

00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:02.535
Too late.

00:07:11.402 --> 00:07:13.969
Lydia gets what Lydia wants.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.715
Come on, get in.

00:07:14.716 --> 00:07:16.233
We can stop by his place
and see if he's there.

00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:20.550
Hmm, is that him with the
best explanation ever of why

00:07:20.551 --> 00:07:22.331
he's half a freaking hour late?

00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:24.033
Not exactly.

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:33.195
What the hell?

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:36.135
It's a dumpster.

00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:38.656
He pushed it in front of the door.

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:39.631
To block us in.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:41.734
Come on, help me.

00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:43.063
Ugh, stop!

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.209
I'm not dying here.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.301
I'm not dying at school.

00:07:47.302 --> 00:07:48.327
We're not going to die.

00:07:49.473 --> 00:07:50.437
God, what is he doing?

00:07:50.438 --> 00:07:51.271
What does he want?

00:07:51.272 --> 00:07:52.118
Me.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.282
Derek says it's stronger with a pack.

00:07:54.283 --> 00:07:55.701
Yeah, great.

00:07:55.836 --> 00:07:57.745
A psychotic werewolf who's into teen wolf.

00:07:57.746 --> 00:07:59.392
That's--that's beautiful.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.466
What're we doing here anyway?

00:08:31.232 --> 00:08:32.479
All I got was this.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.661
They lock the doors at night, you know?

00:08:36.546 --> 00:08:37.527
That one's open.

00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:44.068
You don't need me to state
the obvious, right?

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:46.499
That it looks like they
broke into the school?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.143
No, pretty obvious.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.538
Do you want me to come with you?

00:08:52.618 --> 00:08:53.682
Mm, it's okay.

00:08:54.052 --> 00:08:54.938
Hey, Allison...

00:08:59.757 --> 00:09:02.013
You have this look like you're
about to say "be careful."

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:05.151
I am.

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:09.069
What?

00:09:11.154 --> 00:09:12.085
That concerned look on you,

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:12.902
I've never seen it before.

00:09:12.903 --> 00:09:14.184
Well, I am concerned.

00:09:15.603 --> 00:09:17.636
Well, that's a good look on you.

00:09:18.903 --> 00:09:20.635
Don't worry.

00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:21.696
I'll be right back.

00:09:22.293 --> 00:09:23.217
Okay.

00:10:19.015 --> 00:10:19.977
All right, we have to do something.

00:10:19.978 --> 00:10:20.547
Like what?

00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:21.239
I don't know.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.093
Kill it, hurt it, inflict mental
anguish on it--something.

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:44.306
Wait a minute, no--

00:10:44.307 --> 00:10:46.597
Shh, shh, shh.

00:10:57.681 --> 00:10:59.027
The desk. Come on, the desk.

00:11:06.317 --> 00:11:07.301
He can't...

00:11:12.034 --> 00:11:13.468
All right.

00:11:22.355 --> 00:11:23.355
Do you see that?

00:11:23.356 --> 00:11:24.225
See what?

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:29.159
The hood on that piece of crap
jeep looks crappier than usual.

00:11:31.623 --> 00:11:32.422
Where are you going?

00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:34.523
To take a look, stay here.

00:11:34.524 --> 00:11:35.619
I'm not staying in the car.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.721
Just stay in the damn--

00:11:36.722 --> 00:11:38.587
Do not leave me alone in the car.

00:11:39.895 --> 00:11:41.321
Fine.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:44.967
God, don't have a meltdown.

00:12:10.866 --> 00:12:12.076
Look at that.

00:12:12.077 --> 00:12:13.679
It is indeed a piece of crap.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.984
Can we get Allison and leave now?

00:12:22.101 --> 00:12:25.066
What are you doing?

00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:26.899
Are you getting Allison?

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.266
Jackson!

00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:30.799
Oh!

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.734
Come on, get across.

00:12:31.735 --> 00:12:32.799
Come on!

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.170
What?

00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:42.944
What are you doing?

00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:44.391
I just wanna get a look at it.

00:12:44.524 --> 00:12:45.411
Are you crazy?

00:12:45.412 --> 00:12:47.066
Look, it's trapped, okay?

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.498
It's not gonna get out.

00:12:58.166 --> 00:13:00.000
Yeah, that's right, we got you--

00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:00.934
Will you shut up!

00:13:00.935 --> 00:13:02.300
I'm not scared of this thing.

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:07.400
I'm not scared of you.

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:09.520
Right, 'cause you're in there,

00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:10.477
and we're out here.

00:13:11.278 --> 00:13:12.908
You're not going any--

00:13:32.967 --> 00:13:34.133
Scott?

00:14:00.565 --> 00:14:01.729
Scott?

00:14:06.486 --> 00:14:07.585
Scott?

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.093
Scott?

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:17.530
Scott?

00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:21.647
There's one right here.

00:14:21.648 --> 00:14:22.851
Are you kidding me?

00:14:22.852 --> 00:14:24.038
You have to use the bathroom now?

00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:24.916
Yes now.

00:14:24.917 --> 00:14:27.602
You have a problem with my showing
a basic biological function?

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:30.797
You know, I'm starting to have a
problem with all of your functions.

00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:43.688
McCall.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.830
Scott?

00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:54.535
Derek?

00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:04.444
Did you find them?

00:15:13.403 --> 00:15:15.690
No, no.

00:15:39.894 --> 00:15:40.736
Wait.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.742
Do you hear that?

00:15:41.743 --> 00:15:42.558
Hear what?

00:15:42.974 --> 00:15:44.171
It sounds like a phone ringing.

00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:45.223
What?

00:15:45.407 --> 00:15:46.479
I know that ring.

00:15:47.474 --> 00:15:48.586
It's Allison's phone.

00:15:53.284 --> 00:15:55.217
Hey.

00:15:55.218 --> 00:15:56.950
I can't seem to find them.

00:15:56.951 --> 00:15:59.218
Okay, give me a second
and I'll be right there.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.251
Stiles?

00:16:06.252 --> 00:16:07.304
It's me, where are you?

00:16:07.305 --> 00:16:09.498
I'm in the school looking for you,
why weren't you at my place?

00:16:09.499 --> 00:16:10.434
Where are you right now?

00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:11.532
On the first floor.

00:16:13.018 --> 00:16:14.742
Where? Where are you exactly?

00:16:14.743 --> 00:16:16.389
The swimming pools.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.538
Get to the lobby.

00:16:17.539 --> 00:16:18.458
Go now.

00:16:19.351 --> 00:16:20.736
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

00:16:26.084 --> 00:16:27.056
Why did you come?

00:16:27.057 --> 00:16:28.052
What are you doing here?

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:29.162
Because you asked me to.

00:16:29.163 --> 00:16:30.382
I asked you to?

00:16:35.976 --> 00:16:38.176
Why do I get the feeling you
didn't send this message?

00:16:38.177 --> 00:16:39.076
Because I didn't.

00:16:39.077 --> 00:16:39.810
Did you drive here?

00:16:39.811 --> 00:16:40.842
Jackson did.

00:16:40.843 --> 00:16:42.586
Jackson's here too?
And Lydia, what's going on?

00:16:42.587 --> 00:16:43.869
Who sent this text?

00:16:44.977 --> 00:16:45.954
Where are you?

00:16:49.386 --> 00:16:50.429
Finally.

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:52.060
Can we go now?

00:17:01.305 --> 00:17:02.254
Run!

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.039
Help me get this in front of the door.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.248
Scott, wait, not here.

00:17:32.249 --> 00:17:33.215
What was that?

00:17:33.216 --> 00:17:34.760
Scott, what was that?

00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:35.661
What came out of the ceiling?

00:17:35.662 --> 00:17:36.928
Will you just help me?

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:38.593
The chairs, stack the chairs.

00:17:38.594 --> 00:17:39.760
Guys...

00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:40.828
Can we just wait a second?

00:17:40.829 --> 00:17:43.293
You guys, listen to me, w--

00:17:43.294 --> 00:17:44.814
Can we wait a second?

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:48.580
Guys?

00:17:50.227 --> 00:17:51.993
Stiles talking.

00:17:51.994 --> 00:17:56.127
Can we hang on one second, please?

00:17:56.128 --> 00:17:58.626
Hello!

00:17:58.627 --> 00:18:00.993
Okay, nice work.

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:02.960
Really beautiful job, everyone.

00:18:02.961 --> 00:18:06.141
Now...What should we do about
the 20 foot wall of windows?

00:18:10.161 --> 00:18:11.924
Can somebody please explain
to me what's going on,

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.564
because I'm freaking out here.

00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:15.937
And I would like to know why.

00:18:18.095 --> 00:18:18.982
Scott?

00:18:29.095 --> 00:18:30.893
Somebody killed the janitor.

00:18:30.894 --> 00:18:31.558
What?

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:33.205
Yeah, the janitor's dead.

00:18:35.184 --> 00:18:36.104
What's he talking about?

00:18:36.105 --> 00:18:37.088
Is this a joke?

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:39.074
What, who killed him?

00:18:41.043 --> 00:18:42.174
No, no, no, no.

00:18:42.438 --> 00:18:43.752
This was supposed to be over.

00:18:43.753 --> 00:18:44.546
The mountain lion killed--

00:18:44.547 --> 00:18:45.626
No, don't you get it?

00:18:45.627 --> 00:18:46.685
There wasn't a mountain lion.

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:47.785
Who was it?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.852
What does he want?

00:18:51.686 --> 00:18:52.782
What's happening?

00:18:54.594 --> 00:18:55.804
Scott!

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.652
I-I don't know.

00:18:58.406 --> 00:18:59.734
I-I just...

00:19:00.517 --> 00:19:02.128
If we go out there, he's gonna kill us.

00:19:02.129 --> 00:19:02.776
Us?

00:19:02.777 --> 00:19:03.892
He's gonna kill us?

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.727
Who?

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.708
Who is it?

00:19:14.099 --> 00:19:14.981
It's Derek.

00:19:14.982 --> 00:19:15.907
It's Derek Hale.

00:19:16.721 --> 00:19:18.090
Derek killed the janitor?

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.282
Are you sure?

00:19:20.283 --> 00:19:21.268
I saw him.

00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:23.132
- The mountain li--
- No, Derek killed them.

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:24.376
All of them?

00:19:24.377 --> 00:19:25.862
Yeah, starting with his own sister.

00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:26.794
The bus driver?

00:19:26.795 --> 00:19:29.760
And the guy in the video store--it's
been Derek the whole time.

00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:31.314
He's in here with us.

00:19:35.427 --> 00:19:37.827
And if we don't get out now...

00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:39.528
He's going to kill us too.

00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:53.934
Call the cops.

00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:54.664
No.

00:19:54.665 --> 00:19:55.899
Wh--what do you mean "No?"

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:56.526
I mean no.

00:19:56.527 --> 00:19:57.710
You wanna hear it in Spanish?

00:19:57.711 --> 00:19:58.522
No.

00:19:59.547 --> 00:20:00.859
Look, Derek killed three people, okay?

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.466
We don't know what he's armed with.

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:05.218
Your dad is armed with an
entire sheriff's department.

00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:05.762
Call him.

00:20:05.763 --> 00:20:06.760
I'm calling.

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:08.693
No, Lydia, would you just hold on a second.

00:20:08.694 --> 00:20:09.576
Hey.

00:20:11.368 --> 00:20:12.821
Yes, we're at beacon hills high school.

00:20:12.822 --> 00:20:14.229
We're trapped, and we need you to--

00:20:16.917 --> 00:20:17.718
But--

00:20:21.823 --> 00:20:23.122
She hung up on me.

00:20:23.421 --> 00:20:24.587
The police hung up on you?

00:20:24.588 --> 00:20:25.656
She said they got a tip warning them that

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:28.019
there are gonna be prank calls about
a break-in to the high school.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.812
She said if I called again that

00:20:28.813 --> 00:20:30.674
they're gonna trace it
and have me arrested.

00:20:30.675 --> 00:20:31.921
Okay, then call again.

00:20:31.922 --> 00:20:33.666
No, they won't trace a cell.

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:35.948
Then they'll send a car to your
house before they send anyone here.

00:20:35.949 --> 00:20:37.299
What the--what--

00:20:37.648 --> 00:20:38.868
What is this?

00:20:39.276 --> 00:20:40.781
Why does Derek wanna kill us?

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.645
Why is he killing anyone?

00:20:49.911 --> 00:20:51.438
Why's everyone looking at me?

00:20:51.706 --> 00:20:52.866
Is he the one that sent her the text?

00:20:52.867 --> 00:20:53.722
No.

00:20:54.016 --> 00:20:55.560
I mean, I don't know.

00:20:55.561 --> 00:20:56.643
Is he the one that called the police?

00:20:56.644 --> 00:20:57.939
I don't know!

00:21:00.587 --> 00:21:02.611
All right, why don't we just back
off the throttle here, yeah?

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.185
Okay, first off, throwing Derek
under the bus, nicely done.

00:21:08.186 --> 00:21:08.990
I didn't know what to say.

00:21:08.991 --> 00:21:10.206
I had to say something.

00:21:10.207 --> 00:21:11.967
And if he's dead then it
doesn't matter, right?

00:21:11.968 --> 00:21:13.471
Except if he's not.

00:21:14.362 --> 00:21:15.768
Oh, God, I totally just bit her head off.

00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:17.319
And she'll totally get over it.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.085
Bigger issues at hand here,

00:21:18.086 --> 00:21:19.729
like how do we get out alive?

00:21:20.217 --> 00:21:21.332
But we are alive.

00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:22.959
It could've killed us already.

00:21:23.306 --> 00:21:24.963
It's like it's cornering us or something.

00:21:24.964 --> 00:21:26.779
So what, he wants to eat
us all at the same time?

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.638
No!

00:21:27.756 --> 00:21:28.966
Derek said it wants revenge.

00:21:28.967 --> 00:21:30.060
Against who?

00:21:30.545 --> 00:21:31.884
Allison's family?

00:21:32.308 --> 00:21:34.044
Maybe that's what the text was about.

00:21:34.622 --> 00:21:35.466
Someone had to send it.

00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:37.310
Okay, assheads...

00:21:37.439 --> 00:21:38.563
New plan.

00:21:38.564 --> 00:21:40.254
Stiles calls his useless dad and tells him

00:21:40.255 --> 00:21:42.276
to send someone with a gun and decent aim.

00:21:42.414 --> 00:21:43.486
Are we good with that?

00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:48.368
He's right.

00:21:48.967 --> 00:21:51.666
Tell him the truth if you
have to, just call him.

00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:56.234
I'm not watching my dad get eaten alive.

00:21:58.785 --> 00:22:00.000
All right, give me the phone.

00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:02.212
Jackson!

00:22:02.608 --> 00:22:03.633
Are you okay?

00:22:03.775 --> 00:22:05.378
Hey, are you okay?

00:22:15.782 --> 00:22:17.034
Dad, hey, it's me.

00:22:17.668 --> 00:22:19.071
And it's your voicemail.

00:22:19.962 --> 00:22:22.328
Look, I need you to call me back now.

00:22:22.329 --> 00:22:23.790
Like, right now.

00:22:28.064 --> 00:22:29.060
We're at the school, okay?

00:22:29.061 --> 00:22:30.304
We're at the school.

00:22:33.886 --> 00:22:34.780
Go away.

00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:35.807
Oh, my God.

00:22:38.371 --> 00:22:40.166
The kitchen, the door out of the
kitchen leads to the stairwell.

00:22:40.167 --> 00:22:41.240
Which only goes up.

00:22:41.241 --> 00:22:42.735
Up is better than here.

00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:40.864
Jackson, how many people
can fit in your car?

00:23:40.865 --> 00:23:42.550
Five, if someone squeezes on someone's lap.

00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:43.178
Five?

00:23:43.179 --> 00:23:44.785
I barely fit in the back.

00:23:44.786 --> 00:23:45.307
It doesn't matter.

00:23:45.308 --> 00:23:47.241
There's no getting out
without drawing attention.

00:23:47.581 --> 00:23:48.699
What about this?

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:51.875
This leads to the roof.

00:23:51.876 --> 00:23:54.266
We can go down the fire escape to
the parking lot in, like, seconds.

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:55.514
That's a deadbolt.

00:23:58.371 --> 00:23:59.411
The janitor has a key.

00:23:59.412 --> 00:24:01.077
You mean his body has it.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.058
I can get it.

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.826
I can find him by scent, by blood.

00:24:05.827 --> 00:24:07.995
Well, gee, that sounds like
an incredibly terrible idea.

00:24:07.996 --> 00:24:09.079
What else you got?

00:24:11.878 --> 00:24:12.982
I'm getting the key.

00:24:15.136 --> 00:24:16.023
Are you serious?

00:24:16.024 --> 00:24:17.334
Well, it's the best plan.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.998
Someone has to get the key
if we wanna get out of here.

00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:21.488
You can't go out there unarmed.

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:30.300
Well, it's better than nothing.

00:24:30.301 --> 00:24:31.447
There's gotta be something else.

00:24:31.448 --> 00:24:32.489
There is.

00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:38.306
What are we gonna do? Throw acid on him?

00:24:38.307 --> 00:24:39.141
No.

00:24:39.142 --> 00:24:40.272
Like a fire bomb.

00:24:40.273 --> 00:24:41.253
In there is everything you need

00:24:41.254 --> 00:24:43.341
to make a self-igniting Molotov cocktail.

00:24:43.342 --> 00:24:44.302
Self-igniting--

00:24:44.303 --> 00:24:46.398
Molotov cocktail.

00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:50.004
What?

00:24:51.154 --> 00:24:52.373
I read it somewhere.

00:24:53.336 --> 00:24:54.937
We don't have a key for that either.

00:25:04.235 --> 00:25:05.871
Jackson, hand me the sulfuric acid.

00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:22.675
No.

00:25:22.814 --> 00:25:24.320
No, this is insane, you can't do this.

00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:25.948
You cannot go out there.

00:25:25.949 --> 00:25:27.248
We can't just sit here waiting for Stiles

00:25:27.249 --> 00:25:28.470
to have to check his messages.

00:25:28.759 --> 00:25:29.791
You could die.

00:25:29.792 --> 00:25:31.084
Don't you get that?

00:25:31.413 --> 00:25:33.127
He's killed three people.

00:25:33.128 --> 00:25:34.302
And we're next.

00:25:36.003 --> 00:25:37.085
Somebody has to do something.

00:25:37.086 --> 00:25:38.981
Scott, just stop.

00:25:40.343 --> 00:25:41.433
Do you remember--

00:25:41.487 --> 00:25:43.224
Do you remember when you told me

00:25:43.514 --> 00:25:44.740
you knew whether or not I was lying?

00:25:44.741 --> 00:25:46.012
That I had a tell.

00:25:47.393 --> 00:25:48.504
So do you.

00:25:52.121 --> 00:25:53.746
You're a horrible liar.

00:25:53.747 --> 00:25:55.693
And you've been lying all night.

00:25:58.027 --> 00:25:58.953
Just...

00:25:59.889 --> 00:26:02.000
Just please--please don't go.

00:26:02.083 --> 00:26:03.386
Please don't leave us.

00:26:03.647 --> 00:26:04.614
Please.

00:26:13.543 --> 00:26:14.684
Lock it behind me.

00:30:04.372 --> 00:30:05.673
I don't get this.

00:30:05.809 --> 00:30:07.072
I don't get why he's out there,

00:30:07.073 --> 00:30:07.824
and why he left us.

00:30:07.825 --> 00:30:09.465
And I can't...

00:30:10.397 --> 00:30:11.849
I can't stop my hands from shaking.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:12.864
It's okay.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.272
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

00:30:19.544 --> 00:30:20.491
Okay.

00:31:24.785 --> 00:31:27.091
Jackson, you handed me the
sulfuric acid, right?

00:31:27.393 --> 00:31:28.408
It has to be sulfuric acid.

00:31:28.409 --> 00:31:29.504
It won't ignite if it's not.

00:31:29.505 --> 00:31:31.886
I gave you exactly what
you asked for, didn't I?

00:31:33.094 --> 00:31:33.999
Yeah.

00:31:36.076 --> 00:31:37.331
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.740
Come on.

00:31:50.912 --> 00:31:51.940
Come get me.

00:32:00.902 --> 00:32:01.838
Damn it.

00:32:57.222 --> 00:32:58.456
Uh, no, I'm fine.

00:32:59.478 --> 00:33:00.382
Like, seriously, I'm okay.

00:33:00.383 --> 00:33:01.900
That didn't sound okay at all.

00:33:01.901 --> 00:33:03.333
What's on the back of your neck?

00:33:48.675 --> 00:33:50.135
I said I'm fine.

00:33:50.784 --> 00:33:51.527
It's been there for days.

00:33:51.528 --> 00:33:52.320
He won't tell me what happened.

00:33:52.321 --> 00:33:54.076
As if you actually care.

00:34:47.784 --> 00:34:50.321
All right, can we not argue
for half a second here?

00:34:50.322 --> 00:34:52.049
Where's Scott? He should be back by now.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.155
Back by now.

00:35:24.232 --> 00:35:25.122
Scott!

00:35:27.122 --> 00:35:27.739
Scott!

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.808
Where's he going?

00:35:28.906 --> 00:35:29.750
Scott.

00:35:30.801 --> 00:35:31.661
Scott.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.738
Scott! Scott!

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:34.619
Stop.

00:35:34.736 --> 00:35:35.685
Stop!

00:35:36.458 --> 00:35:37.497
Do you hear that?

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:45.681
Listen.

00:36:18.401 --> 00:36:19.918
You sure it was Derek Hale?

00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:20.920
Yes.

00:36:20.921 --> 00:36:21.995
I saw him too.

00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:24.166
What about the janitor?

00:36:24.716 --> 00:36:25.768
We're still looking.

00:36:26.142 --> 00:36:27.817
Did you check under the bleachers?
Under them?

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:29.373
Yeah, Scott, we looked.

00:36:29.785 --> 00:36:32.265
We pulled them out just like
you asked, there's nothing.

00:36:32.266 --> 00:36:33.435
I'm not making this up.

00:36:33.436 --> 00:36:35.120
I know, I believe you, I do.

00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:36.547
No, you don't.

00:36:37.096 --> 00:36:40.489
You have this look like
you feel bad for me.

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.880
Like you wanna believe me,
but I know you don't.

00:36:45.607 --> 00:36:46.536
Listen...

00:36:48.087 --> 00:36:49.730
We're gonna search this whole school.

00:36:49.731 --> 00:36:50.899
We're gonna find him.

00:36:51.087 --> 00:36:52.045
Okay?

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.584
I promise.

00:36:55.134 --> 00:36:56.114
Sheriff!

00:36:57.466 --> 00:36:58.371
Stay.

00:36:58.372 --> 00:36:59.389
Both of you.

00:37:02.712 --> 00:37:04.129
Well, we survived, dude.

00:37:04.955 --> 00:37:07.003
You know? We outlasted the Alpha.

00:37:07.427 --> 00:37:08.193
It's still good, right?

00:37:08.194 --> 00:37:09.177
Being alive?

00:37:10.498 --> 00:37:13.526
When we were in the chemistry
room, he walked right by us.

00:37:13.527 --> 00:37:15.223
You don't think that it heard us?

00:37:15.224 --> 00:37:17.174
You don't think it knew
exactly where we were?

00:37:17.633 --> 00:37:18.751
Well, then how come we're still alive?

00:37:18.752 --> 00:37:20.661
It wants me in it's pack.

00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:26.027
But I think, first...

00:37:26.857 --> 00:37:28.956
I have to get rid of my old pack.

00:37:31.975 --> 00:37:33.707
What do you mean? What old pack?

00:37:35.533 --> 00:37:36.598
Allison.

00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:38.557
Jackson, Lydia.

00:37:40.796 --> 00:37:41.700
You.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.361
The Alpha doesn't wanna kill us.

00:37:56.605 --> 00:37:57.866
It wants me to do it.

00:38:02.233 --> 00:38:03.819
And that's not even the worst part.

00:38:04.632 --> 00:38:08.073
How in holy hell is that
not the worst part, Scott?

00:38:08.451 --> 00:38:10.344
Because when he made me shift...

00:38:13.733 --> 00:38:15.148
I wanted to do it.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.973
I wanted to kill you.

00:38:22.454 --> 00:38:23.498
All of you.

00:38:50.105 --> 00:38:51.155
There you are.

00:38:51.604 --> 00:38:52.588
How...?

00:38:53.695 --> 00:38:54.376
How you--

00:38:54.377 --> 00:38:55.294
Get out?

00:38:56.183 --> 00:38:57.243
Not easily.

00:38:57.922 --> 00:38:58.878
And from what they tell me,

00:38:58.879 --> 00:39:00.232
I'm alive because of you.

00:39:01.351 --> 00:39:02.906
I think I owe you a raise.

00:39:04.866 --> 00:39:07.007
Guys, come on, let's let
the EMT's do their job.

00:39:07.008 --> 00:39:08.278
You can talk to him later.

00:39:11.902 --> 00:39:12.977
Allison!

00:39:16.206 --> 00:39:17.199
Are you okay?

00:39:17.886 --> 00:39:19.140
My dad's on his way.

00:39:20.095 --> 00:39:22.703
You need--you need anything from me?

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.418
Want me to go with you?

00:39:23.419 --> 00:39:24.291
No.

00:39:25.017 --> 00:39:25.994
I don't.

00:39:27.005 --> 00:39:27.983
Okay.

00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:31.532
And I also don't know what
happened to you in there.

00:39:32.454 --> 00:39:33.990
I don't know what you were thinking.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.863
Maybe you weren't, but...

00:39:39.262 --> 00:39:41.690
Right now, I don't--I don't
feel like I can trust you.

00:39:44.959 --> 00:39:46.400
- Allison, I can explain.
- I don't care.

00:39:46.401 --> 00:39:48.208
Okay, don't say anything else,
please, just don't say--

00:39:48.209 --> 00:39:50.073
- Scott, I ca--
- Allison, just stop.

00:39:50.292 --> 00:39:52.007
Please, just don't say anything.

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:53.256
Stiles' dad is gonna give me a ride home.

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:55.278
I need to make sure my
mom isn't freaking out.

00:39:55.516 --> 00:39:57.926
I'm gonna get a new phone
tomorrow morning, and--

00:39:57.927 --> 00:39:58.991
- Scott--
- I'm gonna get a new phone,

00:39:58.992 --> 00:39:59.950
and I'm gonna give you a call--

00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:00.937
Don't.

00:40:01.925 --> 00:40:02.902
What?

00:40:03.453 --> 00:40:04.654
Don't call.

00:40:09.065 --> 00:40:09.979
Just...

00:40:10.286 --> 00:40:12.394
Just please don't call me.
