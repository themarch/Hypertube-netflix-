- If you tell
yourself a lie over and over,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.292
you start to believe it.

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:28.708
When imagination takes over,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.500
when we close our eyes,

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:33.708
ideas and fantasy worlds start to form.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Daydreams, moments free
of constraints and rules.

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:40.333
Truth can be thrown out of the window

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.292
or rearranged in a new image.

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:47.458
Homocore, Queercore,
started as a secret society,

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:52.708
a make believe world, a
farce that became real.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.250
Conceived a generation before the internet

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:58.250
by a couple of frustrated 20-year-olds.

00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:02.000

- The early roots of punk were actually

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.958
quite sexually radical and diverse.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.333
There was a lot of sexual experimentation,

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.958
sexual ambivalence,
bisexuality, transsexuals.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:34.917
The problem with the gay
scene in the mid-80s was that

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:38.917
for us the gay scene
was completely bourgeois

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:40.458
and conventional.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.167
There was a lot of conformist behavior.

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:46.083
It was also very divided
in terms of male and female

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:47.500
and we didn't feel welcome.

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.792
I mean, I would get kicked
out of gay bars in Toronto

00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:52.875
for wearing swastika earrings.

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.625
My style wasn't recognized
as part of the gay movement.

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:57.708
So I was actually looked
at with a lot of suspicion,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.250
like they thought I was
going to beat them up.

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:01.833
- Corner of Wellington and Portland.

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.167
Probably some sort of domestic dispute.

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:07.458
Looks like a couple of fag, homosexuals.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.292
We're just going to let them sort it out.

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:11.417
- We were influenced
by The Situationists

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:13.500
and Society of the Spectacle

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.250
and The Revolution of Everyday Life

00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:19.667
and books like that, so our
idea was to create a spectacle,

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:24.500
create personae, invent
characters, invent a whole scene.

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:28.750
- Gays, lesbians,
bisexual, transgender people

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.625
were living outside of the law.

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:34.208
It wasn't technically illegal

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.458
but in every other way
behavior was still policed.

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:42.083
Gender representation was still policed,

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:45.750
not just by neighbors,
friends, schoolmates,

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:47.958
associates, but by the police.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.958
People were being arrested.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.833
My friends were being
beaten up on the street.

00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:55.208
- So we decided that
we would form a rag tag gang

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.625
of queer revolutionaries.

00:03:57.917 --> 00:03:59.000
You had to be queer,

00:03:59.292 --> 00:04:01.917
an outlaw by birthright so to speak.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:04.458
There would be no dress code, no style,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.542
no fixed symbol or logo.

00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:08.875
We'd be more like a pack of wolves

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:11.833
than a full-fledged existing gang.

00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:13.750
And that was fine by us.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:16.292
We wanted to be a circus, not a church.

- Occupying a position
where you are outside

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:32.583
of the laws of the
country that you live in

00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:35.292
gives you an entirely
different perspective than

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:37.750
having legal status.

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:40.958
Because you develop a critical

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.250
faculty in order to look at
the society you're living in,

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:47.792
and you don't just take
everything for granted.

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:50.000
You learn how to examine things

00:04:50.292 --> 00:04:53.958
and navigate through a hostile landscape.

- I was rejected by two subcultures,

00:05:16.708 --> 00:05:19.500
which was the gay subculture
and the punk subculture.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:24.583
So I've always felt like I'm
on the fringe of the fringe.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.708
In Toronto in the 80s there
was a hardcore punk scene

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.875
but there wasn't an alternative
scene for queer kids,

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:47.042
so our strategy was to
pretend that Toronto

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:51.958
had a full fledged crazy gay
punk scene already happening.

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.667
And it was dykes and faggots together,

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.167
and transgender people and
everyone already fighting

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.583
against not only the bourgeoisie within

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:07.458
the gay orthodoxy, but
against the macho punks

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.583
who weren't as radical
as they claimed to be,

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:12.917
who couldn't deal with homos and dykes.

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:20.333
- Look, you say
you wanna be in this movie

00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:22.875
but there is no roles for skinheads.

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:26.917
Skinheads are too neo-Nazi to
hold the fascination of, say,

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:29.667
a new, revolutionary youth cult.

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.458
So, what's it gonna be?

00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:37.625
Skinhead, or a star?

00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.125
Say Doc Marten.

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:49.292
- Part of our modus operandi
was to go to punk shows

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:52.625
or have straight punk
boys over to our house

00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:56.042
and get them drunk, and then we'd get them

00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:59.042
to take their clothes off
and take pictures of them

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:02.708
and put them in our
movies or our fanzines.

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:19.042
- We had the bases covered.

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:21.083
An upfront cult style allegiance under the

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:25.292
banners of good old punk
rock, sex, and violence.

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:28.708
And we were convinced that no one was

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.792
gonna take us seriously.

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:33.667
But people did.

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.000
Dozens of them.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:38.833
- And it actually worked.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.833
I mean people thought that Toronto was the

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:45.708
hub of this hardcore gay punk movement.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.417
And it turned out to
just be me and two women,

00:07:48.708 --> 00:07:52.333
who sat in their basement and churned out

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:56.500
alternative publications
and experimental movies.

00:07:57.792 --> 00:08:01.083
- I had read a lot
of Situationists theory

00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:04.458
and I had certain ideas about what happens

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.875
when you push situations in a
culture to the breaking point,

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:13.958
And when you reach a point
where society can't contain the

00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:17.875
contradictions any longer,
it forces a change.

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:20.458
If the theory was right, and it was right.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.625
- I met G.B. and
Fifth Column, the girl band

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:25.708
that G.B. Jones was a member of.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.208
They were, in their way,
deeply feminist as I was.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.917
And then I just started
go-go dancing for them

00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:35.125
shortly after that.

00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:36.625
- What did you bring?

00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:38.583
- Oh, I brought my new go-go boy.

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:40.417
Put on a song, he'll prance for us.

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:41.917
- Really?

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:47.125
♪ Oh you insecure little bitch ♪

00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:03.667
- And then I moved in with them.

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:08.583
G.B. Jones already had
amazing, kind of unorthodox

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:12.458
punk fanzines that had a
lot of homosexual subtext.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.833
So they were much more broad minded

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:16.125
and they were into all
sorts of doing kinds of

00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:17.875
alternative culture.

00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:22.500
- Zines are
self-published magazines,

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:25.833
the analog predecessor to
blogs and social media.

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:28.125
They were huge in the 80s and 90s.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:31.958
Traded at concerts, sold for
change at cool book shops

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.958
or mail ordered and delivered
in a brown envelope.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.917
Inside the small photocopied
pages were stories

00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:43.833
about loud bands, punk scenes
and Do-It-Yourself politics.

00:09:47.042 --> 00:09:49.292
- I thought it
would be really exciting

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:52.208
to start a zine for our
crowd so I asked Bruce

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.833
if he wanted to do a zine with me

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.250
and we started doing J.D.s.

00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:03.208
- We lived in
this really ramshackeled

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.958
kind of squat like building
that was really falling apart

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.375
and decrepit.

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:10.792
It was like this little punk
community, and G.B. and I

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:13.958
would sit upstairs and we'd do J.D.s.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.125
We'd cut and paste and
write our manifestos.

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:21.333
♪ If I do that, the tabloids
will have a field day ♪

00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:23.417
♪ I wanna go and have some fun ♪

00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:25.917

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:31.042
- Bruce LaBruce
was also an invention.

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:34.292
He claimed J.D.s stood
for Juvenile Delinquents

00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:37.125
but later for James Dean, J.D. Salinger,

00:10:37.417 --> 00:10:38.958
and Jeffrey Dahmer.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.958
He claimed he himself was
a creation of G.B. Jones,

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.500
having described himself
as Frankenstein's monster.

00:10:46.792 --> 00:10:49.083
- My philosophy of
homosexuality has always been

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:51.833
to embrace the things
that make you different,

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.208
to embrace the more radical

00:10:57.208 --> 00:10:58.917
aspects of gay identity.

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:01.583
We even went as far to say, in J.D.s,

00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:05.458
homosexual is criminal,
and kind of like actually

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.042
embraced the criminality of homosexuality.

00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:13.458
- Yes, tons of shock value,

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.292
'cause it wasn't activism,
it wasn't protest,

00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:20.875
it wasn't about legalities
and mechanism of the state.

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:26.792
And on the other hand,
it was about culture,

00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:30.042
aesthetics, glamour, stardom, freedom,

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.167
all the things that can be
used as opposition to a state.

00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:44.083
- It had a lot of different elements.

00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:46.792
It was very politically
serious on one hand

00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:49.125
and very frivolous on the other.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.542
There was a certain amount of camp.

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:53.833
There was a lot of auto-critique.

00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:57.042
And that's part of the strategy
of building up a spectacle,

00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.833
so you can create a spectacle
and then tear it down,

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:03.625
and that was done through
laughing at yourself.

00:12:03.917 --> 00:12:04.542
A lot.

00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:11.583
"You're a skinhead, aren't you?" I said.

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:15.500
I could tell right away.

00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:20.750
I happen to know a fair
bit about skinheads,

00:12:21.042 --> 00:12:22.333
believe it or not.

00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:26.458
It's kind of a hobby with me.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.917
An obsession, almost.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.417
You see, I'm a hairdresser.

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:45.250
- We really started
in the anarchist community,

00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:47.375
we didn't really start
in the gay community.

00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:50.917
That was our milieu
really, and the punk scene

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:55.542
and the post-punk scene,
and experimental filmmakers

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:56.500
and artists.

00:12:56.792 --> 00:12:59.000
Like that's really where we came out of.

00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:01.583
- This isn't your movie
anymore, it's our movie.

00:13:01.875 --> 00:13:03.542
- Now you're in our movie.

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:05.083
Why would we wanna be in your movie?

00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:07.708
We can make our own movies now.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.458
- Yeah, we're gonna
make our own movies.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.292
- Yeah.

00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:12.917
- We know just as
many perverts as you do.

00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:14.292
- Yeah.

00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:20.042
- You don't wanna make
communication an elite thing.

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:24.042
And I think that's really a
lot of what punk was about,

00:13:24.333 --> 00:13:27.292
you know, a hands on, do what you want

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.208
of the people type of thing, you know.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.917
You didn't have to worry about
that you didn't have access

00:13:35.208 --> 00:13:37.333
to the media, to television,

00:13:38.708 --> 00:13:41.042
book publishing or
whatever, you made your own.

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:43.125
You made your own record,
you make your own fan zine,

00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:45.583
you made your own scene.

00:13:47.875 --> 00:13:50.583
- We talked a lot about
how the roots of punk

00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:52.000
were very queer.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.000
And the original
etymology of the word punk

00:13:58.292 --> 00:14:02.458
was based on jailhouse
slang where punks were

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.833
the passive boys in jail
who got fucked up the ass.

00:14:12.292 --> 00:14:16.833
- Punk when started it
really was the potential for,

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:20.750
you know queer stuff, and
it was definitely there.

00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:23.250
I mean it kinda just under
the surface, you know.

00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:27.917

- The So Cal punk scene had Nervous Gender

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.625
and Phranc and The Germs
and Catholic Discipline,

00:14:59.917 --> 00:15:03.083
and bands that represented
alternative sexuality.

- By the end of the 70s and the early 80s,

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.792
the first wave of punk
which had been pretty open

00:15:21.083 --> 00:15:23.167
and accepting to weirdos of all kinds,

00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:27.292
it got replaced by more
and more stereotypical

00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:31.125
kind of violence and
shows became very scary.

00:15:35.042 --> 00:15:37.208
- I think mid to late 80s,
punk had become very macho

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.500
and it was homophobic,
and I would get beat up

00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:43.000
at hardcore shows for looking queer.

00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:53.625
J.D.s was really a revenge zine,

00:15:53.917 --> 00:15:57.417
it was a revenge against the macho punks.

00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.167
Of course it was pre-internet,

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:13.083
and we sent it to people.

00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:15.417
We advertised it in Maximumrocknroll

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:18.292
and Factsheet 5 and Forced
Exposure or whatever

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:21.542
fanzine that had a larger circulation.

00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:25.417
- When we were
touring we were kind of like

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:27.208
this travelling circus, practically.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.333
"Here's the band, and here's the zines

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:31.250
"and here's the movies, and..."

00:16:31.542 --> 00:16:35.458
And that's really how it
spread so quickly because

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.625
people were encountering it
on so any different levels.

00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:42.208
So then Bruce and I kind
of put across this idea

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.708
that this is like a huge
international movement

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.708
and people believed it.

00:16:51.625 --> 00:16:53.958
- Thank you for coming
to the show to actually see

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.625
the DIY bands play.

00:16:57.625 --> 00:17:00.500
We don't need the corporate bullshit.

00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:01.792
- Although the kids in Toronto

00:17:02.083 --> 00:17:04.792
are mostly credited for creating Homocore,

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:06.458
they weren't the only ones.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.083
In Los Angeles the punk
drag queen Vaginal Davis

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:10.583
ruled the scene.

00:17:10.875 --> 00:17:13.542
In San Francisco, two
anarchists, Deke and Tom,

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:18.667
started a zine they called
Homocore, solidifying the name.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.625
- In San Francisco, at
that time, there was like

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:26.458
this layer of like arty
weirdos and we were less

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.167
concerned with who was gay or not

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:31.375
than having like, a
cohort to hang out with.

00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:34.792
Punk and gay overlap was at the fringes.

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:42.250
- Tom expressed a lot of discontent over

00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:46.500
how he felt marginalized,
it just felt like there

00:17:46.792 --> 00:17:48.458
was something missing.

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:51.542
- We found J.D.s, you know, it didn't have

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:54.958
any straight forward manifesto
or statement of purpose.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.583
It was an aesthetic
created in images and text,

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.667
we were like, "Fuck yes!

00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.500
"I don't know why this is
good, but this is really good."

00:18:05.625 --> 00:18:07.083
It started with anarchist bookstore crowd.

00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:12.042
We went to this anarchist
conference in Toronto and,

00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:13.375
when we got there and I met Deke.

00:18:13.667 --> 00:18:15.750
- Within the first couple
days they had a queer

00:18:16.042 --> 00:18:17.250
anarchist circle.

00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.333
- And when all the straight
boys were throwing rocks

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:22.625
and getting all righteous, we were like,

00:18:22.917 --> 00:18:24.958
hanging out like "Wow,
queer punks, oh cool!"

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.958
- Everybody wanted, you know,
scene reports if you will.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.458
What's going on in your town?

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.958
When it came my turn
I said something like,

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.250
you know, I'm the only person in my scene

00:18:33.542 --> 00:18:37.583
who is willing to be out
and Tom Jennings heard me.

00:18:40.208 --> 00:18:42.333
He was the one in the crowd who thought,

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:45.500
"Yeah, you know, what about
all those isolated kids

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:46.542
"out there?"

00:18:46.833 --> 00:18:48.125
- When I came back from
the anarchist conference,

00:18:48.417 --> 00:18:51.458
I did the first issue of Homocore in

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.458
response to my experience in Toronto,

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.625
where I met Bruce and all that stuff.

00:18:59.083 --> 00:19:00.917
- In true punk rock
fashion we disseminated

00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:03.000
our ideas through a zine.

00:19:03.292 --> 00:19:06.375
Photocopied communiques,
cut and paste collages.

00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:10.417
Pornography, blasphemy, anarchy, sodomy.

00:19:10.708 --> 00:19:11.958
Sure it's been done before.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.958
But the best thing that could
happen is not to be unique,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.792
but to be part of an ongoing history.

00:19:18.083 --> 00:19:20.500
- G.B. Jones and Bruce LaBruce
had been putting out J.D.s,

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:23.083
they had a couple of
issues out and that's where

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:26.083
Tom swiped the word Homocore from.

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:28.917
- The core was important
as the homo, you know,

00:19:29.208 --> 00:19:31.750
so it was about hardcore punk.

00:19:32.042 --> 00:19:34.958
- I thought it was
funny to play on hardcore

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:40.042
and I thought it would being
really upsetting for people.

00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:43.042
♪ Rebel rebel on the street ♪

00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:45.458
- We did a show at the
Deaf Club, which was a venue

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.458
for the very early punk scene
and then it kind of gone away.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.417
It was clubhouse for deaf
people and they let people

00:19:50.708 --> 00:19:52.333
put on punk shows there
'cause the noise didn't

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:55.458
bother them, but they would
use to dance to the vibrations

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.500
and the stomping of the floor.

00:19:57.792 --> 00:19:59.333
And so for the first time in a few years,

00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:03.333
we did a Homocore benefit
show there with MDC

00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:06.042
and that was kind of the launch.

00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:07.542
- I didn't do this
consciously, I'd love to take

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:08.625
credit for these things.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:11.292
No, in fact we set it up
to end up making the world

00:20:11.583 --> 00:20:13.083
we wanted to live in, 'cause
you can either complain

00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:14.083
or you gonna do something.

00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:16.250
So basically Deke and
I became sort of cohort

00:20:16.542 --> 00:20:17.667
and worked on Homocore together.

00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.042
We were selectively
documenting things that

00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:22.417
we liked in the world, and
intentionally or otherwise,

00:20:22.708 --> 00:20:25.708
creating this mythology of
queer punk in San Francisco

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
that did not exist.

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:27.833
That was the point.

00:20:28.125 --> 00:20:29.875
It really didn't exist.

00:20:31.208 --> 00:20:34.917
- We had a Homocore
top 10 list of bands

00:20:35.208 --> 00:20:38.917
that we really liked that
had gay themed songs.

00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:43.167
- Some of the songs
were very homophobic.

00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:45.708
I had no problem like
putting in a band writing

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.417
a homophobic song claiming
they are part of a movement

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:52.625
of queers that wanted to do punk music.

00:20:52.917 --> 00:20:56.708
What a better way to get revenge on them?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.458
- We were grasping for stuff
that was musically compatible.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.500
Like, "Look, this is a great punk song!

00:21:03.792 --> 00:21:04.750
"Oh, you're a bunch of dickheads.

00:21:05.042 --> 00:21:06.125
"Oh, well that's less interesting now."

00:21:06.417 --> 00:21:06.958
Unless you're really cute

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.583
and that last for like 15 minutes, right?

00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:10.042
So there was a bunch of that.

00:21:10.333 --> 00:21:11.042
♪ Fuck you, say my name ♪

00:21:11.333 --> 00:21:14.125
♪ Fuck you, say my name ♪

00:21:14.417 --> 00:21:16.458
- Anti-Scrunti Faction,
A.S.F, I think it was

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.125
the first real dyke band.

00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:21.167
The name Anti-Scrunti
Faction makes fun of like

00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:24.417
the straight girls that
would go to the shows

00:21:24.708 --> 00:21:27.125
just to blow the guys in the band.

00:21:27.417 --> 00:21:30.583
They made up a name for
those girls, scrunti.

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:34.625
And then their band was
Anti-Scrunti Faction.

00:21:34.917 --> 00:21:35.667
- Donna was trying to form bands

00:21:35.958 --> 00:21:39.292
and find compatible
people, and review records,

00:21:39.583 --> 00:21:44.083
and a few times we just went
off and sort of made stuff up.

00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:44.958
We just found records that seemed

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.250
like they'd be compatible.

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:53.167
- It's no mistake, that in every society,

00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:58.167
in every tribal structure there
are laws governing sexuality

00:21:58.458 --> 00:22:00.042
and to us that suggests that sexuality

00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:02.667
has in itself some power and energy,

00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.167
which is, these societies
and controls have

00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:08.000
a vested interest in suppressing.

00:22:08.292 --> 00:22:11.708
That freedom is taken away
when there is a threat,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.958
therefore there is a threat
to control from sexuality,

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.667
therefore it ought to be
investigated and liberated.

00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:21.000
There was a disconnect
between the roots of punk

00:22:21.292 --> 00:22:23.667
and how it has been
expressed and revealed,

00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:28.042
it was the same old fear of
exposure went for a while.

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:30.708
So for me it was just really
liberating and refreshing

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.042
when it finally became
integrated again with queer.

00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:41.125
Because, if a community
has any right to shout

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.292
about inequity, it's
the gay queer community.

00:22:46.583 --> 00:22:48.792
It certainly has been for a long time, so,

00:22:49.083 --> 00:22:53.917
it just seemed to me completely
logical that at some point

00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:56.583
that outrage at inequity,

00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:02.500
would also be expressed more
in terms of gender politics

00:23:02.792 --> 00:23:05.333
because there was so many
queer people involved.

00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:07.208
That it would start towards
on them, it's not just

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.708
about mundane, day-to-day party politics.

00:23:12.125 --> 00:23:13.917
It goes much deeper.

00:23:14.208 --> 00:23:17.292
It's about human rights,
it's about the right

00:23:17.583 --> 00:23:18.625
to be whoever you want to be,

00:23:18.917 --> 00:23:19.917
which is was what some
of the earlier songs

00:23:20.208 --> 00:23:22.167
were saying over and over.

00:23:30.708 --> 00:23:35.542
- Meanwhile, AIDS had already
devastated the gay community.

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:39.875
- The US government
wanted all queer people

00:23:40.167 --> 00:23:41.625
to be dead and they were defunding our art

00:23:41.917 --> 00:23:44.458
and saying that we were
just going to burn in hell

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.958
and people showing up at performances,

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.458
protestors, right-wing
fanatical Christians,

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.708
harassing us and trying to silence us.

00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:02.542
- I was just
wondering, do you think

00:24:02.833 --> 00:24:05.875
I'll be the next the gay
celebrity to die of AIDS?

00:24:06.167 --> 00:24:08.875
I mean, I've been lying
here thinking of them all.

00:24:09.167 --> 00:24:11.500
- Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

00:24:11.792 --> 00:24:13.833
You're not that famous yet.

00:24:15.167 --> 00:24:17.000
- Some people were doing ACT UP,

00:24:17.292 --> 00:24:20.542
and felt like the first thing
was to try to save our dying.

00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:24.708
Some people felt like it's
important to fight for

00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:29.417
the sick among us, but it's
also important to have a life,

00:24:29.708 --> 00:24:30.583
here and now.

00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:32.625
We can't just be reduced to dying of AIDS,

00:24:32.917 --> 00:24:34.833
we have to have our own culture,

00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:36.167
our own spaces, our own movements,

00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:40.250
our own, you know, positive
part of living, too.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.792
And that's were I think groups
like Queer Nation came from.

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.542
It was a much more
proactive agenda, that said,

00:24:46.833 --> 00:24:48.500
"Okay, let's get back to Gay Liberation."

00:24:48.792 --> 00:24:52.958
- Queer Nation was a relatively
diverse organization,

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.500
and I joined it in San
Francisco, and it was all about

00:24:55.792 --> 00:24:56.792
queer visibility.

00:24:57.083 --> 00:25:01.250
It just became an intentional,
political choice to go out

00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:05.125
and be seen, and be queer,
and be in-your-face,

00:25:05.417 --> 00:25:09.708
and have people know that we
existed and what we were about.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.375
- We had been with ACT
UP, we had been political,

00:25:11.667 --> 00:25:12.792
we'd been roaming around but we hadn't yet

00:25:13.083 --> 00:25:16.125
found that community, and we
went to that gay pride parade,

00:25:16.417 --> 00:25:17.708
oh, I remember it.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.333
- Two, four, six, eight,

00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:21.542
gays and lesbians educate!

00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:24.167
Two, four, six, eight, how do you know

00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:25.625
your teacher's straight?

00:25:25.917 --> 00:25:27.542
- And here it comes!

00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:31.500
- I was by myself, I hadn't
made that many friends

00:25:31.792 --> 00:25:32.750
at that point.

00:25:33.042 --> 00:25:35.375
I said, "I'm gonna go,
and I'm just gonna stand

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.375
"at the beginning of the parade route,

00:25:37.667 --> 00:25:41.083
"and when I see a float or an organization

00:25:41.375 --> 00:25:44.167
"or some people that I feel
like I can fit in with,

00:25:44.458 --> 00:25:46.083
"I'm just jumping in the parade."

00:25:46.375 --> 00:25:49.375
- We did a float at the
Gay Pride Parade in 1989

00:25:49.667 --> 00:25:51.292
in San Francisco where

00:25:53.208 --> 00:25:57.458
a rich benefactor rented a
junk car and a tow truck.

00:25:59.667 --> 00:26:04.333
And we painted the car to look
vaguely like a police car,

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.000
and somebody made a giant
papier maché high heel,

00:26:10.292 --> 00:26:13.167
which we stuck in the top of
the car as if was crushing

00:26:13.458 --> 00:26:14.458
the police car.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.875
And we towed this thing down Market Street

00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:19.667
as our parade entry.

00:26:19.958 --> 00:26:23.125
And just sort of let it all
hang out that we were the punks,

00:26:23.417 --> 00:26:26.042
he hated the police,
because they hated us.

00:26:26.333 --> 00:26:30.375
- And all the sudden, around
the corner comes this.

00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:40.042
- They pulled the cop car,
they all were around it,

00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:42.750
and I remembered that it
was like a bunch of punks

00:26:43.042 --> 00:26:45.542
pulling out baseball bats
and proceeding to smash

00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:47.875
the cop car and I was just like, "Yes."

00:26:48.167 --> 00:26:52.208
- Then on the trunk they
had taken an apple crate

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.000
and bolted it to the trunk,

00:26:54.292 --> 00:26:55.667
and filled it with high heels.

00:26:55.958 --> 00:26:58.750
So then I just jumped into the parade,

00:26:59.042 --> 00:27:01.833
and grabbed a high heel and started

00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:04.792
pounding this police car
and we just basically

00:27:05.083 --> 00:27:06.667
destroyed this police car.

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.000
- Which I just love that we have these

00:27:08.292 --> 00:27:09.375
butch and femme memories.

00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:10.625
For me it was the baseball bat,

00:27:10.917 --> 00:27:14.375
so for Justin it was the high heel shoe.

00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:18.583
- And so all of these
people became my friends,

00:27:18.875 --> 00:27:20.417
and then I had a community.

00:27:20.708 --> 00:27:22.750
It was a life-changing day,

00:27:23.042 --> 00:27:25.375
it was really amazing.

00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:27.208
- It was a crystallizing
moment because we were like,

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.542
"That's our people."

00:27:28.833 --> 00:27:30.167
But we didn't look like
them yet so we went home

00:27:30.458 --> 00:27:33.083
and cut our hair into
Mohawks and like went

00:27:33.375 --> 00:27:36.125
and found that scene, but it was that day

00:27:36.417 --> 00:27:38.000
and like seeing that action.

00:27:38.292 --> 00:27:39.583
It was like falling in love.

00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:40.417
Here comes another one of

00:27:40.708 --> 00:27:41.667
those quiet groups.

00:27:41.958 --> 00:27:42.667
- It's their subtlety!

00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:45.250
That's what this parade
is all about, subtlety.

00:27:45.542 --> 00:27:46.750
- In front of that was a banner that said

00:27:47.042 --> 00:27:50.083
"No apologies, no assimilation ever,"

00:27:50.375 --> 00:27:52.125
which caused some frontally
debate in the group

00:27:52.417 --> 00:27:53.708
because some people
thought that assimilation

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.375
was maybe not for them, but
culturally the right way to go

00:27:58.667 --> 00:28:00.750
to take the animus out of homophobia.

00:28:01.042 --> 00:28:03.667
Others of us felt like assimilation

00:28:03.958 --> 00:28:06.833
into a death culture
was itself a death trap.

00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:09.292
You know, you demand the
right to serve in the military

00:28:09.583 --> 00:28:11.667
and you're gonna end up
dropping phosphorous bombs

00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:14.292
on Afghani kids, and
really, is that liberation?

00:28:14.583 --> 00:28:15.375
Is that freedom?

00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:17.167
We didn't feel it was
the spirit of the early

00:28:17.458 --> 00:28:20.208
gay rights movement and
in a wider cultural sense

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.375
was always something that
punk rock actively critiqued.

00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:27.292
- Gays now are really selling
themselves short, I think.

00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:30.458
Because they traditionally have
had such a great opportunity

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.875
to be different and to be
the avant-garde, you know,

00:28:35.917 --> 00:28:39.625
and to be glamorous,
and to be outsiders who

00:28:39.917 --> 00:28:42.417
look at the dominant culture

00:28:42.708 --> 00:28:46.083
or the dominant ideology from
a distance, and they can be

00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:49.083
like spies or double agents.

00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:50.708
That's much more glamorous than trying

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.792
to convince everyone
that you're just the same

00:28:53.083 --> 00:28:55.708
as everyone else and you
have the same feelings

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.375
and you just want to raise a family,

00:28:58.667 --> 00:29:02.208
and, you know, be a well
balanced individual.

00:29:03.292 --> 00:29:06.083
- A person who functions normally

00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:09.000
in a sick society is himself sick.

00:29:13.917 --> 00:29:16.000
- That's what's happened
a lot in the gay movement,

00:29:16.292 --> 00:29:19.125
The oppressed have become the oppressors.

00:29:19.417 --> 00:29:21.417
- In the late 70s,

00:29:21.708 --> 00:29:26.500
mid-70s actually, people started
coming out of the closet.

00:29:26.958 --> 00:29:31.708
People who dragged their feet
coming out of the closet,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.250
came out of the closet
and immediately started

00:29:33.542 --> 00:29:36.625
forming committees.

00:29:36.917 --> 00:29:39.000
Where they tried to tell the rest of us

00:29:39.292 --> 00:29:42.083
who were never in the closet

00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:44.708
what we could say and what we could do.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.833
Oh, they wanted to be professionally gay,

00:29:49.125 --> 00:29:50.000
they wanted to be gay.

00:29:50.292 --> 00:29:52.208
They had meetings where they decided that

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.333
we couldn't say dyke, we couldn't say fag,

00:29:55.625 --> 00:29:56.667
we couldn't say queer.

00:29:56.958 --> 00:29:58.542
Oh, they hated the word queer!

00:29:58.833 --> 00:30:02.292
Ooh, ooh.

00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:05.625
Losers, freaks, and deviants started

00:30:05.917 --> 00:30:08.417
the gay liberation
movement, not these fuckin'

00:30:08.708 --> 00:30:12.667
control freaks.

00:30:14.625 --> 00:30:17.958
We wanted them to go back in the closet.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.583
Now all of a sudden these
same kind of people,

00:30:23.875 --> 00:30:26.333
now they all wanna be queer.

00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:28.583
Well, they're not queer.

00:30:28.875 --> 00:30:31.625
Queer means you have no friends.

00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:35.333
Queers means that you have
sustained a period of rejection,

00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:38.333
isolation and exclusion so profound

00:30:41.083 --> 00:30:44.958
that it marks you as an outsider forever.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.500
Yeah.

00:30:46.792 --> 00:30:50.167
You know, in the 60s
when we said straight,

00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:53.375
we never meant heterosexual.

00:30:54.708 --> 00:30:56.583
We meant narrow-minded.

00:30:56.875 --> 00:30:59.542
And the gay world has
gotten to be a straighter,

00:30:59.833 --> 00:31:02.792
and straighter and a straighter place.

00:31:05.458 --> 00:31:09.625
And I don't have any
preparation or any inclination

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.917
to live in a completely straight world.

00:31:15.792 --> 00:31:19.792
- This journey of freedom
can only really begin

00:31:20.083 --> 00:31:21.625
when all are one sex,

00:31:23.583 --> 00:31:24.417
one gender,

00:31:26.125 --> 00:31:27.708
one true experience.

00:31:29.292 --> 00:31:33.667
Queer to me means refusing
to be part of the status quo,

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:37.667
refusing to accept the
mantle of so called normalcy.

00:31:37.958 --> 00:31:41.542
- Actually this time really
rejecting gay in general,

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:45.083
the gay community must be destroyed.

00:31:45.375 --> 00:31:49.792
- The thing is, that they
want to be separate by equal.

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:52.542
- I think that identity
politics are for people

00:31:52.833 --> 00:31:55.292
who don't have an identity.

00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:58.625
You know, because to me,
why you would describe

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.833
yourself only by your sexuality?

00:32:02.125 --> 00:32:04.292
- You see, they never talk about anything

00:32:04.583 --> 00:32:06.125
but their sex life.

00:32:06.417 --> 00:32:09.208
That's why they have to be separate.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.292
- I'm still more at home in a punk bar

00:32:11.583 --> 00:32:13.833
than a gay bar if you
want to know the truth.

00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:16.083
I'd get laid better.

00:32:16.375 --> 00:32:19.250
More my type, the few maybe,

00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:23.625
not everybody's gay but
they're more well rounded.

00:32:23.917 --> 00:32:26.250
So, the punk community is always, I feel,

00:32:26.542 --> 00:32:28.500
very safe with and very at home with.

00:32:28.792 --> 00:32:30.333
Like the straight gay people I know today

00:32:30.625 --> 00:32:32.833
that are more conservative
than my parents were,

00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:34.917
there's more rules in the
gay world now than there

00:32:35.208 --> 00:32:37.125
was in the world I rebelled from.

00:32:37.417 --> 00:32:41.625
But I don't know any straight
punks meaning that way.

00:32:41.917 --> 00:32:44.333
You know, that look punks,
but they are very conservative

00:32:44.625 --> 00:32:45.167
in real life.

00:32:45.458 --> 00:32:47.750
I don't know too many of them.

00:32:53.542 --> 00:32:55.625
- We hated nice gay people,

00:32:56.542 --> 00:33:00.333
we hated the fake friendliness
of our supposed community.

00:33:00.625 --> 00:33:02.458
We hated the homogenization
brought on by years

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.083
of shit dance music and designer clothes.

00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:07.458
Of course you could commodify each other,

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.375
you all look the fucking same.

00:33:09.667 --> 00:33:12.417
We hated the sexism, the
racism, the classism.

00:33:12.708 --> 00:33:15.667
We hated their drugs, their
bathouses, bars and clubs.

00:33:15.958 --> 00:33:19.292
More than anything, we
didn't want to fit in.

00:33:19.583 --> 00:33:22.167
Like the tattoo says, we
wanted to be godless, lawless,

00:33:22.458 --> 00:33:23.250
and nomadic.

00:33:24.333 --> 00:33:27.292
You alienated us before
we even got started.

00:33:27.583 --> 00:33:29.417
But you know, when all was said and done,

00:33:29.708 --> 00:33:31.375
when all of this was over,
when the blood and spunk

00:33:31.667 --> 00:33:34.000
had dried and there is
nothing left for us to say,

00:33:34.292 --> 00:33:36.125
what we came up with,
no matter how dogeared

00:33:36.417 --> 00:33:38.208
and fucked up it all was, what we came up

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.042
with was better than any of this.

00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:44.917
When you realize that you're queer,

00:33:45.208 --> 00:33:46.583
and you look back at the
way you've been treated

00:33:46.875 --> 00:33:48.250
or the things that you've been told about

00:33:48.542 --> 00:33:50.917
the way society is allowed to treat you,

00:33:51.208 --> 00:33:52.542
the way you are supposed
to think about yourself

00:33:52.833 --> 00:33:54.875
in relationship to
society that say you're,

00:33:55.167 --> 00:33:57.542
you know, perverse or
you're evil or like any

00:33:57.833 --> 00:33:59.375
of these kind of like

00:34:00.667 --> 00:34:02.958
pejorative terms that
have been thrown at you.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.958
When you realize that that's wrong

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:10.542
fundamentally, and that you
know innately in yourself

00:34:10.833 --> 00:34:11.917
that you're connecting
with something that's

00:34:12.208 --> 00:34:14.917
not only correct but natural,

00:34:15.208 --> 00:34:18.042
I think that there's a
process that one goes through

00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:20.708
where one starts to analyze
all of the other systems

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.708
that one's involved in,

00:34:23.792 --> 00:34:25.875
and then we go through and
analyze them as stringently.

00:34:26.167 --> 00:34:28.750
What else I've been told that's not true?

00:34:29.042 --> 00:34:31.625
What else have I been convinced of

00:34:31.917 --> 00:34:33.083
that's actually false?

00:34:33.375 --> 00:34:34.875
What else is supported
and sustained by society

00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:36.917
that maybe is artificial?

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:40.250
And so I think that this
alignment of queer and punk

00:34:40.542 --> 00:34:43.625
was a really, really
natural kind of alignment.

00:34:43.917 --> 00:34:46.167
Punks have always been
questioning the status quo

00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:50.417
and, you know, queers very
naturally should be, too.

00:34:50.708 --> 00:34:53.542
- It's true that there
will be no revolution

00:34:53.833 --> 00:34:55.250
without sexual revolution.

00:34:55.542 --> 00:34:58.917
But, it's also true that there will be

00:34:59.208 --> 00:35:03.667
no be sexual revolution
without homosexual revolution.

00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:05.750
Do you know what I mean?

00:35:07.542 --> 00:35:10.458
- The idea of a homosexual
agenda sounds like you're

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.000
actively trying to recruit straight people

00:35:13.292 --> 00:35:16.708
into homosexuality, for
example, which I think is

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.125
a great pastime.

00:35:19.625 --> 00:35:24.542
You know, I think it's a
really worthy goal so, why not?

00:35:24.833 --> 00:35:26.125
I mean, there's always
been this perception

00:35:26.417 --> 00:35:29.750
that gays are this kind of
predatory kind of animal,

00:35:30.042 --> 00:35:31.417
which I think is quite exciting.

00:35:33.583 --> 00:35:36.667
- Heterosexuality is the
opiate of the masses.

00:35:39.083 --> 00:35:40.333
- Yes, Gudrun.

00:35:45.083 --> 00:35:47.375
- Join the homosexual Intifada!

00:35:49.292 --> 00:35:50.500
- I know, Gudrun.

00:36:01.583 --> 00:36:03.875
- I like the idea of embracing

00:36:04.167 --> 00:36:06.083
the negative stereotypes that

00:36:06.375 --> 00:36:08.792
straight society has about homosexuals

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:11.500
and really sticking it to them.

00:36:12.542 --> 00:36:15.875
- We felt that at its
strongest queer culture

00:36:16.167 --> 00:36:19.833
represented a standing
critique of the entire society

00:36:20.125 --> 00:36:23.042
and its illnesses and what
needed to be overthrown,

00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:26.333
you know, a much more
revolutionary take on the

00:36:26.625 --> 00:36:28.500
potential of queer liberation.

00:36:28.792 --> 00:36:31.542
And that in fact, queer
liberation represents

00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:35.708
a sexual liberation for
everyone including straights.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.500
And Homocore is an expression
of that in its time and place,

00:36:38.792 --> 00:36:42.125
that liberation, not
assimilation, critique.

00:36:42.417 --> 00:36:44.875
We kind of felt like we were putting

00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:46.833
the punk back in the homo movement,

00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:50.125
and the homo back in the punk
movement at the same time.

00:36:50.417 --> 00:36:53.458
- It brought a lot of people out

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:58.583
because up to that time it
was, you, people felt trapped.

00:36:58.958 --> 00:37:01.125
They felt "Well, okay.

00:37:01.417 --> 00:37:06.250
"I like guys, but does that
mean that I have to like disco?

00:37:06.667 --> 00:37:07.958
"They all go together, right?

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.458
"Those horrible clothes, and disco music?

00:37:12.875 --> 00:37:14.417
"So if I like guys I gotta like disco

00:37:14.708 --> 00:37:17.542
"and have bad taste in clothes?"

00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:21.083
Homocore, Tom's magazine, and the stuff

00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:24.917
that Bruce LaBruce was doing
freed people from doing that.

00:37:25.208 --> 00:37:27.875
"Yeah, I can like guys and
have a black leather jacket.

00:37:28.167 --> 00:37:29.583
"All right!"

00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:32.750
So, it was like a great leap forward,

00:37:35.542 --> 00:37:38.667
and it really lead to the
freedom and liberation

00:37:38.958 --> 00:37:43.292
for a lot of people who
were kept in the closet,

00:37:43.583 --> 00:37:46.792
not from the society's "Oh, you're bad if

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.542
"you're a homosexual", but
they were kept in the closet

00:37:50.833 --> 00:37:54.042
because they liked stuff that wasn't gay.

00:37:56.042 --> 00:37:57.917
And, what could they do?

00:37:58.208 --> 00:38:00.333
They had to choose, and Homocore let them.

00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:01.292
"Oh, you don't have to choose.

00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:05.375
"You can have your cock and
eat it, too."

00:38:05.667 --> 00:38:10.500

00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:13.708

00:38:16.458 --> 00:38:18.458
- All these celebrities
coming out of the closet

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:23.000
has contributed to gay culture
becoming very mediocre.

00:38:23.292 --> 00:38:26.333
It's taking the mystique
out of homosexuality.

00:38:26.625 --> 00:38:29.292
- Why can't homosexuality
be an invisible influence

00:38:29.583 --> 00:38:32.167
on art and culture and the media?

00:38:33.708 --> 00:38:34.708
That's what I don't understand.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.375
- You know, I'm gay but I
don't like all gay things,

00:38:37.667 --> 00:38:39.083
sometimes they're terrible.

00:38:39.375 --> 00:38:42.208
So I think the gay punk rock
movement was brave enough

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.458
to admit that, that gay is not enough.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.250
- I think queer
culture has to step back

00:38:48.542 --> 00:38:52.042
from the really narrow
definition that people

00:38:52.333 --> 00:38:55.458
in the last century have imposed upon it,

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.958
and open itself back up
to what it used to be,

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:03.375
prior to the narrow focus
that's been forced upon it

00:39:04.833 --> 00:39:08.667
because of the necessity
of political activism.

00:39:10.875 --> 00:39:12.208
- Oh, those queers.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.083
They're fuckin' political.

00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:16.208
- Oh, so political.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.417
It's time to get apolitical,
back to our gay roots.

00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:22.208
- The artist is more
important than the activist.

00:39:31.792 --> 00:39:36.708
- Let's round up the
bitches and kick some ass.

00:39:38.708 --> 00:39:40.750
- I thought, "I wanna
do some kind of activism

00:39:41.042 --> 00:39:43.208
"that sort of picks up
where ACT UP left off.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.375
"I wanna do cultural activism."

00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:47.125
I'm a musician.

00:39:47.417 --> 00:39:48.625
I'll form a band.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:27.583
Turns out other people had the
same idea at the same time.

00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:31.583
- We created this little world
that was kind of fictional,

00:40:31.875 --> 00:40:34.083
but then it did start to
develop into something real.

00:40:34.375 --> 00:40:38.333
So in the early 90s bands
actually started forming

00:40:39.583 --> 00:40:42.917
and contributing original music to J.D.s.

00:40:44.125 --> 00:40:46.875
- Before the Sex Pistols
formed Malcolm McLaren

00:40:47.167 --> 00:40:50.250
had this idea of what he
wanted a band to be like,

00:40:50.542 --> 00:40:51.875
before there was a band like that

00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:53.167
and before there was a scene.

00:40:53.458 --> 00:40:56.667
It's kind of the same
way with Homocore with

00:40:56.958 --> 00:41:00.250
G.B. Jones and Bruce LaBruce in Toronto

00:41:00.542 --> 00:41:02.875
dreaming up this scene
when there wasn't any.

00:41:03.167 --> 00:41:07.125
But, it culturally seemed
like it was a ripe idea.

00:41:08.458 --> 00:41:10.458
- Almost all things, including
electronic inventions

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.667
are responses to culture.

00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:15.958
So while I was doing this
and Deke was doing this,

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.750
the people in Toronto had been doing this,

00:41:19.042 --> 00:41:20.250
the people in Philadelphia had.

00:41:20.542 --> 00:41:22.958
And then there's a moment
when there's simultaneous

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.250
discovery, or simultaneous invention.

00:41:25.542 --> 00:41:27.708
- We became known as the Homocore movement

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.458
and then the Queercore movement.

00:41:33.417 --> 00:41:35.833

but they're really parallel issues.

00:41:50.917 --> 00:41:52.708

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.500

were the first doing, like,

00:42:07.667 --> 00:42:10.583
what we were doing, which
is saying "We are all dykes,

00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:12.333
"only dykes are allowed in the band,

00:42:12.625 --> 00:42:16.542
"and we are gonna sing about being dykes".

00:42:16.833 --> 00:42:17.625
Period, dot.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.125
- There weren't that many songs, about,

00:42:23.417 --> 00:42:24.667
songs about love.

00:42:24.958 --> 00:42:28.250
I mean, can you imagine
thinking that there

00:42:28.542 --> 00:42:31.125
is a problem because there
aren't enough songs about love

00:42:31.417 --> 00:42:32.292
that you can relate to?

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:33.750
I mean, that's crazy.

00:42:34.042 --> 00:42:36.542
It was a real desperation, I mean it was,

00:42:36.833 --> 00:42:39.042
it felt like life or death to me.

00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:42.958
I felt like if I didn't find some dykes

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:47.083
to play music with, like to
play, not just any music,

00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:51.083
but music that was like
the music that I just,

00:42:51.375 --> 00:42:55.125
that was like my soul connection
to the universe, you know,

00:42:55.417 --> 00:42:57.875
that I couldn't imagine living.

00:42:58.167 --> 00:43:00.208
I couldn't imagine actually

00:43:01.583 --> 00:43:02.833
going on.

00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:03.667
Going on.

00:43:03.958 --> 00:43:05.042
I couldn't imagine it.

00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:09.292
I couldn't imagine how I
would be able to do that.

00:43:10.375 --> 00:43:12.792
So it felt like life or death.

00:43:16.167 --> 00:43:17.500
That made me cry.

00:43:34.417 --> 00:43:36.458
- Part of the reason I
wanted to do the band

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.750
was because nobody was out,
there was nobody saying

00:43:40.042 --> 00:43:42.625
"I'm gay and I'm playing this music" or

00:43:42.917 --> 00:43:45.167
"I'm gay, fuck you" or whatever.

00:43:45.458 --> 00:43:46.958
I mean, the only people
that I knew were out were

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.167
people like Sylvester
and Jimmy Sommerville.

00:43:51.458 --> 00:43:53.250
So there was this idea that gay culture

00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:56.417
seemed really limited so I felt alienated.

00:43:56.708 --> 00:43:59.708
I had so many more
friendships and acceptance

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.333
being gay from straight
people in the music scene.

00:44:03.625 --> 00:44:07.792
And being musical and being
into rock 'n' roll in the

00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:12.708
gay scene just made people
act really shitty towards me.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.083
- We love rock, we wanted
to go to rock shows

00:44:15.375 --> 00:44:19.125
where there are other people
that we can like have fun with

00:44:19.417 --> 00:44:21.250
and make out with, and we wanna
hear what they have to say.

00:44:21.542 --> 00:44:23.375

00:44:23.667 --> 00:44:27.292

00:44:27.583 --> 00:44:29.417
When I saw Phranc playing
for the first time,

00:44:29.708 --> 00:44:30.958
tears just started running down my face,

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.208
and I didn't realize why
at first and I think later

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.458
I remember like driving
home after the show,

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.458
and just saying like I don't think that

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:42.542
I'd ever seen someone who I could be

00:44:44.042 --> 00:44:45.208
who is older than me.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.417
When life in front of you is that empty,

00:44:47.708 --> 00:44:51.208
like you just are desperate
to just tell your story

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.500
and hear other peoples stories.

00:44:53.792 --> 00:44:55.458
- Do you guys know
Phranc, the all-American

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.750
Jewish lesbian folksinger?

00:44:59.042 --> 00:44:59.667
Oh, good.

00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:03.958
This song is basically
about me wishing that

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.083
Phranc were my mom.

00:45:06.375 --> 00:45:07.917
Phranc has the really good advice like,

00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:10.750
not to have crushes on straight girls.

00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:13.958
And, uh, it's about choosing
your own family when

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.792
you're gay 'cause you
have to because probably

00:45:17.083 --> 00:45:20.458
your own family didn't
treat you very well.

00:45:31.708 --> 00:45:33.042
- We were like angry dykes on stage.

00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:35.333
It was an angry time, we were angry.

00:45:35.625 --> 00:45:37.042

00:45:37.333 --> 00:45:39.958
♪ Femme bitch top ♪

00:45:41.208 --> 00:45:43.292
And we were totally hypocritical,

00:45:43.583 --> 00:45:46.083
half the time we would sing a song about

00:45:46.375 --> 00:45:49.000
straight girls thinking
you wanna sleep with them

00:45:49.292 --> 00:45:50.792
and the next song would be like

00:45:51.083 --> 00:45:53.583
"Hey, straight guy I'm
hitting on your girlfriend".

00:45:53.875 --> 00:45:58.333
Just had to be constantly
unbalancing whenever possible.

00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:00.167
For a young straight man to come up

00:46:00.458 --> 00:46:02.167
and suck Lynnee's dick.

00:46:03.542 --> 00:46:06.042
- Besides that, it
proves how punk rock you are.

00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:07.208
- It does.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.708
The best thing was like
getting a straight guy

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.125
to get up on stage and
give Lynnee a blowjob.

00:46:11.417 --> 00:46:14.083
It was amazing, you know,
and they got really into it

00:46:14.375 --> 00:46:16.792
because, not always, not in Texas.

00:46:17.083 --> 00:46:20.042
It became like a badge
of honor to give Lynnee

00:46:20.333 --> 00:46:23.708
a blowjob on stage as a straight guy.

00:46:28.625 --> 00:46:29.875
- Good boy.

- They had never seen
it, but they also weren't

00:46:47.458 --> 00:46:50.542
like against it, they were
like embracing it immediately.

00:46:50.833 --> 00:46:52.375
They were like this is punk rock:

00:46:52.667 --> 00:46:54.125
fucking with gender is fucking with the

00:46:54.417 --> 00:46:59.208

means it's punk rock, so yeah.

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:26.917
who slam around and take their shirts off

00:47:27.208 --> 00:47:31.667
and show off their pecks, so
you've got these macha girls

00:47:31.958 --> 00:47:34.208
who go on stage and take their shirts off

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.083
and show off their pecks.

00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:38.500
So Homocore is exactly that,

00:47:38.792 --> 00:47:41.333
playing on homo-tude, to be punk.

00:47:43.792 --> 00:47:48.708
- The definition of punk is to
subvert the dominant paradigm

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.583
through art or culture, through music.

00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:55.000
And, we were turning gender on its head,

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.542
we were turning sexuality on its head.

00:47:58.833 --> 00:48:01.417
We just took what we were
doing and sang about it.

00:48:01.708 --> 00:48:03.667
- Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

00:48:03.958 --> 00:48:05.708
I just have to introduce them.

they are the magnificent, Team Dresch.

00:48:28.833 --> 00:48:30.292
- It was just really
simple, we just said what

00:48:30.583 --> 00:48:34.625

00:49:16.125 --> 00:49:19.500
being talk about and to
be as blunt about the

00:49:19.792 --> 00:49:21.750
sexual aspect as we were,

00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:25.750
to me it was a real fun
way of saying fuck you

00:49:26.042 --> 00:49:29.292
to the right wing who
just want us to go away,

00:49:29.583 --> 00:49:31.708
and also to gays who are assimilationists

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.333
and just wanted us to be nice and behave.

00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:38.208
And my ACT UP experience taught me, no.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:42.458

behave, push the envelope.

- You know, it was new.

00:50:04.708 --> 00:50:07.042
We were on the break of
this third wave, you know.

00:50:07.333 --> 00:50:09.917
It was like "We're doing
something different here.

00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:11.792
"We're not lesbians, we're dykes."

00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:14.917
I mean basically lesbians
were pissed at us.

00:50:15.208 --> 00:50:19.333
They were all like
"You're stomping around on

00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:21.333
"all this work that we've done.

00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:25.125
"You're like wagging rubber
dicks, gettin' blowjobs,

00:50:25.417 --> 00:50:28.750
"talking about boinking, fisting."

00:50:29.042 --> 00:50:31.042
Whatever, you know it was
the opposite of what they

00:50:31.333 --> 00:50:32.625
had been doing.

00:50:32.917 --> 00:50:34.708
And we were making fun
of them, we were like,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.833
"Haha, Birkenstock babes, whatever."

00:50:38.125 --> 00:50:40.167
♪ Is that enough emotion for you honey ♪

00:50:40.458 --> 00:50:41.833
But of course at the same time we totally

00:50:42.125 --> 00:50:43.292
admired everything that they'd done,

00:50:43.583 --> 00:50:45.083
and we would read everything that they had

00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:47.000
written and we had their
books on our shelves,

00:50:47.292 --> 00:50:48.500
and we studied very
carefully everything that

00:50:48.792 --> 00:50:49.708
they had said and done.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.458
And then we went to
build on that, and say,

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.625
"Okay, well that's, how
that isn't working anymore

00:50:55.917 --> 00:50:56.917
"and this isn't working anymore,

00:50:57.208 --> 00:51:00.500
"and we're gonna take these
things and then we're gonna

00:51:00.792 --> 00:51:02.500
"create the next level.

00:51:03.875 --> 00:51:05.083
"We're sex radicals."

00:51:05.375 --> 00:51:08.125
If you're saying that we have,

00:51:08.417 --> 00:51:11.583
we're in charge of our
bodies, that's what feminism

00:51:11.875 --> 00:51:13.000
is all about, then great.

00:51:13.292 --> 00:51:14.542
Then I should be able to
run around with my tits out,

00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:16.083
and say stop looking at my tits.

00:51:16.375 --> 00:51:18.042
It's just like an elbow, a tit, what?

00:51:18.333 --> 00:51:19.583
It's my pecks, and what?

00:51:19.875 --> 00:51:20.917
I should be able to get a blowjob,

00:51:21.208 --> 00:51:22.708
I should be able to
fuck with a rubber dick,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.667
I should be able to do all that
stuff because it's my body.

00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:28.708
And whatever like attachments,

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.875
you know, becomes my body.

00:51:31.167 --> 00:51:31.875
I'm in charge, right?

00:51:32.167 --> 00:51:34.250
That's what you said, mom.

00:51:34.542 --> 00:51:36.417
How many queers are there?

00:51:36.708 --> 00:51:38.333
Oh see, you had heterosexual parents

00:51:38.625 --> 00:51:39.708
and you turned out queer.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.542
- Fuckin' perverts.

00:51:40.833 --> 00:51:42.125
- So let's see if if
it's okay queer people

00:51:42.417 --> 00:51:45.250
to raise these kids 'cause
it might turn out to

00:51:45.542 --> 00:51:48.750
be fuckin' heterosexual,
like most fuckin' fuck

00:51:49.042 --> 00:51:52.083
fucked up fuckin'
heterosexual fuckin' world!

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:53.542
And we had the power
of the mic and we'd go,

00:51:53.833 --> 00:51:56.083
"Oh look at this guy throwing
his elbow in girls faces.

00:51:56.375 --> 00:51:57.667
"Oh gee, that's bad, dude.

00:51:57.958 --> 00:51:58.625
"You shouldn't be doing that."

00:51:58.917 --> 00:52:00.625
And dykes would just jump on the guy

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:03.083
and beat the crap out and
throw him in the back.

00:52:03.375 --> 00:52:04.750
- Oh my god, did you hear what he said?

00:52:05.042 --> 00:52:06.958
It doesn't matter what gender you are.

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:08.000
Huh?

00:52:08.292 --> 00:52:10.125
I guess the fact that most
women in this room get paid

00:52:10.417 --> 00:52:12.708
a lot less than men do for the same jobs,

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.250
it doesn't matter though, it
doesn't matter what gender.

00:52:16.542 --> 00:52:18.708
I mean, it doesn't matter, I mean,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.500
that one in four women are
raped or that domestic violence

00:52:21.792 --> 00:52:24.417
exists or that women are serial killed or,

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:27.583
or that aren't many women
in, oh, I've heard it,

00:52:27.875 --> 00:52:30.333
I've heard it, I've heard it.

00:52:30.625 --> 00:52:31.833
It matters to me.

00:52:33.708 --> 00:52:35.042
It matters to me.

00:52:36.708 --> 00:52:38.250
And there's also a thing that said,

00:52:38.542 --> 00:52:39.958
women should be in the front
and men should be in the back

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.125
and you should respect that.

00:52:42.417 --> 00:52:44.708
- The Homocore was to
punk as gay liberation was

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.583
to hippie in the same way
that around the same time

00:52:47.875 --> 00:52:50.417
came riot grrrl, which was
kind of the women's liberation

00:52:50.708 --> 00:52:53.083
movement of the punk scene.

00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:55.375
- Some dumb hoes,
these punk rocker bitches

00:52:55.667 --> 00:52:57.333
walking down the street.

00:52:57.625 --> 00:53:00.833
They were asking for it and
they deny it but it's true.

00:53:01.125 --> 00:53:02.292
- Bullshit!

00:53:02.583 --> 00:53:05.458
This song is dedicated to him.

00:53:10.292 --> 00:53:12.250
Suck my left one!

00:53:12.542 --> 00:53:14.542
- Riot grrrl expressed
it in similar terms,

00:53:14.833 --> 00:53:16.167
like "I'm not gonna
hold your leather jacket

00:53:16.458 --> 00:53:18.042
"at the back of the pit anymore, you know,

00:53:18.333 --> 00:53:20.542
"I'm gonna be in the pit
and I'm gonna make it

00:53:20.833 --> 00:53:23.500
"a safe place for people
my size and for all people

00:53:23.792 --> 00:53:27.167
"of all sizes and you
know, all attitudes."

00:53:29.875 --> 00:53:32.208
Riot grrrl and Homocore/Queercore,

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.792
it rose up of the same energy.

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:37.542
- We were actually
really inspired by J.D.s

00:53:37.833 --> 00:53:41.250
and by Homocore and
especially by Double Bill

00:53:41.542 --> 00:53:45.583
by G.B. Jones which changed
my life because I was like,

00:53:45.875 --> 00:53:48.750
I can be a feminist and have
a fucking sense of humor,

00:53:49.042 --> 00:53:50.750
I can talk about rape with like a weird

00:53:51.042 --> 00:53:53.083
fucked up smile on my face.

00:53:54.208 --> 00:53:56.792
There would be no Bikini
Kill without J.D.s

00:53:57.083 --> 00:53:59.083
and without Homocore
and without G.B. Jones.

00:53:59.375 --> 00:54:01.083
I would have no career.

00:54:08.208 --> 00:54:11.875
Bikini Kill started because
we were frustrated that

00:54:12.167 --> 00:54:14.042
when we would talk to women in bands

00:54:14.333 --> 00:54:15.750
they would say they weren't feminist.

00:54:16.042 --> 00:54:19.167
And there was this kind
of like moshing culture

00:54:19.458 --> 00:54:22.667
that was very anti-gay and very anti-women

00:54:22.958 --> 00:54:26.875
and it made it so only
certain people were invited

00:54:27.167 --> 00:54:29.750
to the party and that
was straight white men

00:54:30.042 --> 00:54:31.833
who wanted to touch each
other but didn't know how

00:54:32.125 --> 00:54:34.208
else to touch each other
than to being violent.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.625
And that's what riot grrrl
was reacting against.

00:54:38.917 --> 00:54:41.583
It's like actually this is our party,

00:54:41.875 --> 00:54:43.792
not your party, you know.

00:54:44.083 --> 00:54:46.500
It's like Patti Smith said,
"We started it, we own it,

00:54:46.792 --> 00:54:47.875
"we're taking it over."

00:54:48.167 --> 00:54:49.083
Something like that.

00:54:49.375 --> 00:54:52.000
- Because viewing our
work as being connected

00:54:52.292 --> 00:54:56.833
to our girlfriends politics
real lives is essential

00:54:57.125 --> 00:55:00.708
if we are gonna figure out
how we are doing impacts,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.083
reflects, perpetuates, or
disrupts the status quo.

00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:07.042
I actually feel like I had
a lot of women role models

00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:08.167
when I started.

00:55:08.458 --> 00:55:11.917
In a way the 80s, there
was less women really.

00:55:12.208 --> 00:55:15.500
I mean I was really hard
just to actually think of

00:55:15.792 --> 00:55:17.333
other women in bands.

00:55:19.917 --> 00:55:21.083
- 'Cause there were like
two girls at every show

00:55:21.375 --> 00:55:23.667
when we first started playing
and guys totally hated us,

00:55:23.958 --> 00:55:25.208
and so I was going around the clip board

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.542
and getting peoples
addresses' and inviting every

00:55:27.833 --> 00:55:29.500
girl to the show and saying,
"Please bring your friends,

00:55:29.792 --> 00:55:30.708
"please bring your friends."

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.042
And you create that,
you're a part of creating

00:55:33.333 --> 00:55:34.417
that community.

00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:37.583
Because we are interested
in creating non-hierarchical

00:55:37.875 --> 00:55:41.292
ways of being and making
music, friends, and scenes

00:55:41.583 --> 00:55:43.917
based on communication and understanding,

00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:46.417
instead of competition.

00:55:50.375 --> 00:55:53.500
♪ That girl thinks she's the
queen of the neighborhood ♪

00:55:53.792 --> 00:55:57.042

00:55:57.333 --> 00:56:00.500

♪ I want to try on your clothes ♪

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:18.333
And later on when I did one
of the only mainstream press

00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:21.458
interviews I did, for the LA Weekly,

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.833
and I was asked about riot grrrl

00:56:24.125 --> 00:56:27.167
and we had just had two meetings in DC

00:56:27.458 --> 00:56:30.208
and I said "Oh, yeah
riot grrrl is like all

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:35.292
"over the country, there's
meetings happening everywhere."

00:56:35.917 --> 00:56:39.875
And that article came out and
then girls started looking

00:56:40.167 --> 00:56:44.375
for the meetings like I was
like Minneapolis, Chicago,

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:46.750
you know like LA, wherever.

00:56:47.042 --> 00:56:50.625
I was like, San Luis
Obispo, like whatever.

00:56:50.917 --> 00:56:52.083
I just made up a bunch
of places and I was like

00:56:52.375 --> 00:56:54.875
"Yeah, there is meetings
taking place like all over,

00:56:55.167 --> 00:56:57.500
"like we started this thing,
it's totally a phenomenon."

00:56:57.792 --> 00:57:00.583
And then it became a phenomenon
'cause like I said it was.

00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.875
And I remember having
that feeling that that's

00:57:03.167 --> 00:57:05.333
what the girls in Toronto were doing.

00:57:05.625 --> 00:57:08.250
That they were like five people

00:57:08.542 --> 00:57:11.833
but they made it seem like it was so huge.

00:57:14.833 --> 00:57:17.250
I liked that, I liked that
they felt like they could

00:57:17.542 --> 00:57:20.167
do that, that they were such bitches,

00:57:20.458 --> 00:57:23.833
that they thought they could
just like take over everything

00:57:24.125 --> 00:57:27.167
and more than anything that influenced me.

00:57:27.458 --> 00:57:28.000
- Hello.

00:57:28.292 --> 00:57:28.833
- Oh hi, Candy.

00:57:29.125 --> 00:57:29.708
- Are you up for something?

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.625
- Yeah, what do you mean?

00:57:30.917 --> 00:57:31.667
- Do you wanna join a gang?

00:57:31.958 --> 00:57:32.500
- Yeah!

00:57:32.792 --> 00:57:33.333
- It's all girls.

00:57:33.625 --> 00:57:34.167
- Really?

00:57:34.458 --> 00:57:35.000
- Okay?

00:57:35.292 --> 00:57:37.333
- Okay, sounds great.

00:57:37.625 --> 00:57:41.667
- Oh, yeah man, I
wanna fuck your tight ass.

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:44.250
- That reminds me,
you boys buy toilet paper?

00:57:44.542 --> 00:57:47.000
- Boys don't use as
much toilet paper as girls do

00:57:47.292 --> 00:57:48.958
so I shouldn't have to buy any.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.792
- What?

00:57:50.083 --> 00:57:51.250
What about the shit at
the end of your dick

00:57:51.542 --> 00:57:54.958
while you're packing that
fudge, brownie hounds?

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:56.667
- Because we recognize fantasies of

00:57:56.958 --> 00:58:00.917
Instant Macho Gun Revolution
as impractical lies

00:58:01.208 --> 00:58:03.875
meant to keep us simply
dreaming instead of becoming

00:58:04.167 --> 00:58:07.833
our dreams and thus seek
to create revolution

00:58:08.125 --> 00:58:10.750
in our own lives every single day

00:58:11.042 --> 00:58:12.875
by envisioning and creating alternatives

00:58:13.167 --> 00:58:17.125
to the bullshit Christian
capitalist way of doing things.

00:58:17.417 --> 00:58:19.542

00:58:26.375 --> 00:58:28.167
I've always considered
Queercore and riot grrrl

00:58:28.458 --> 00:58:31.292
a part of the larger thing of punk rock.

00:58:31.583 --> 00:58:35.750
We all were a part of
questioning how large punk rock

00:58:36.042 --> 00:58:40.458
could expand to include
feminism and queerness.

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:43.958
And I think that a lot of
times punk rock in general

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:46.625
gets talked about as a musical genre

00:58:46.917 --> 00:58:48.792
and I always thought of it as an idea,

00:58:49.083 --> 00:58:53.375
an idea that like anybody
can do with they want to do,

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.958
if we could create our own culture.

00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:01.250

00:59:01.542 --> 00:59:04.292

00:59:04.583 --> 00:59:06.750
Bands could sound different
and still be a part

00:59:07.042 --> 00:59:10.583
of the same thing 'cause
we don't all have to

00:59:10.875 --> 00:59:13.292
like each other or sound the same

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.625
in order to be a community.

00:59:17.458 --> 00:59:19.167
- I think mostly what we had in common

00:59:19.458 --> 00:59:22.792
was that our lyrics were a lot about like,

00:59:23.083 --> 00:59:24.792
"Hey, fuck you, we're pissed off,

00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:26.708
"this is the new feminism,

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.250
"and this is how we're doing it now,

00:59:29.542 --> 00:59:31.708
"and if you don't like it suck my dick."

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.792
- Riot grrrl and Queercore
bands were totally tight

00:59:34.083 --> 00:59:36.458
and they toured together
and they were absolutely

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:37.958
comrades in arms.

00:59:39.292 --> 00:59:41.667

- This is my Tribe 8 star.

00:59:56.167 --> 00:59:59.458
So this was given to me by Stacie Quijas,

00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:02.208
also known as Quedge at
Leslie Mah's apartment

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.833
and everybody else from Tribe 8 was there.

01:00:07.042 --> 01:00:11.292
It was one of the coolest
moments of my life.

01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:13.667
I was literally like laying on a blanket

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:16.833
getting a tattoo with
India ink and needles

01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:20.250
from the most beautiful punk
girl I'd ever seen in my life,

01:00:20.542 --> 01:00:24.000
and I was such a fan of their band.

01:00:24.292 --> 01:00:25.958
Seeing Tribe 8 was a big life changer

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:28.083
and we toured with them.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.292
- What was amazing about
being a queer band on tour

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:34.792
in the 90s is you're in this little bubble

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:36.708
with these other queers,
and you're just like

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.208
so fuckin' grateful
that you're in this van

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.417
with four or five other queers because

01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:43.167
you're traveling through
this cultural waste lands

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:44.417
and there's no fuckin' queers.

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:47.042
And when you pull up
to the club and there's

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:49.042
the fucking queers standing out front,

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:50.833
and you can see 'em, you know.

01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:51.833
They got funny color hair,

01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:53.458
they got the facial piercings,
they have the Mohawk,

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.417
they have the wifebeaters
or pleasers, or whatevers,

01:00:56.708 --> 01:00:58.708
you know, and the combat
boots, and you're like,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.292

that were like straight, they
were totally supporting us

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:13.333
and lauding us, and going like

01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:17.250

we love what you are doing."

- I felt so comfortable in my band

01:01:37.833 --> 01:01:41.333
and safe to come out publicly because

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:43.458
I felt that what all the bands were saying

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.333
and what Kurt was saying
was, it's okay to be gay,

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:48.792
and if you don't like it that's not cool,

01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:51.292
and just standing up for gay rights.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:55.167
And Kurt doing lots of
gay press was important.

01:01:55.458 --> 01:01:57.833
- I started being proud
of the fact that I was gay

01:01:58.125 --> 01:02:02.250
even though I wasn't because
I almost found my identity.

01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:04.208
- Kurt was hanging out
with our drummer Toby Veil

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.250
and she was best friends
with Donna Dresch.

01:02:07.542 --> 01:02:09.125
We were all reading the same fanzines

01:02:09.417 --> 01:02:11.875
so I can't imagine that
he never picked up the

01:02:12.167 --> 01:02:13.917
Homocore with Donna's picture on it.

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:16.958
I mean I think that might
have been why he started,

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:21.000
you know graffitiing
"God is gay" everywhere.

01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:23.583
- "'Cause god is gay.

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:26.375
"The whole goddamned world's a fag."

01:02:26.667 --> 01:02:31.458
He made a comment in The
Advocate about liking my films.

01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:35.125
I was totally stoked when he
wrote that, that was so cool.

01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:38.958
- They did write about us
for a very brief second.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.458
We were just, they couldn't
hold the gaze on us too long.

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:47.542
I don't think we were like
made for primetime in that way.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.583
- One of the great attracting
forces in Queercore

01:02:50.875 --> 01:02:54.500
at the time was it was
basically indigestible.

01:02:55.958 --> 01:02:59.042
You know the last thing
that people wanted was

01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:02.708
a bunch of fags that only
know three chords or less

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.792
banging away on their guitars
and saying how great it is

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:08.208
to fuck dudes or anything like that,

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.833
or like, chicks chasing
each other around with

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:14.875
dildos on stage only to
cut them off with chainsaws

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:16.750
and things like that.

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:22.458
Capitalism was not
really prepared for that.

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:26.083
- I think that riot grrrl got
picked up by the media because

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:28.792
it was a bunch of the way
that they portrayed it was

01:03:29.083 --> 01:03:33.125
it was like these hot white
girls who were pissed off

01:03:33.417 --> 01:03:35.208
but it was sexy.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.667
I do think it was more palpable
and it was way less gay.

01:03:38.958 --> 01:03:41.958
I don't think at that
time the media was ready

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.500
for anything that was gay

01:03:44.792 --> 01:03:46.458
and they could say like we are bisexual

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:49.500
but that was sexy to straight men.

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:54.583
- It is so much easier for
capitalism to use a female body

01:03:55.292 --> 01:03:58.750
that a man might want, to sell shit,

01:03:59.042 --> 01:04:02.208
than it is to use queer
people and queer bodies.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.625
You know Jack Halberstam
actually has this whole

01:04:04.917 --> 01:04:07.750
riff about how everything in the world

01:04:08.042 --> 01:04:09.917
can be used by capitalism to sell things

01:04:10.208 --> 01:04:12.708
except the butch lesbian body.

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:18.250

01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:21.042

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:33.917
The lack of media spotlight glare,

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:38.958
helped Queercore have more
natural, less conflictual life

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.208
as a culture.

01:04:41.292 --> 01:04:43.125
Because there weren't
like huge things that you

01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:47.125
had to constantly be
defining yourself against.

01:04:48.208 --> 01:04:52.708
Gender non-confirming people
and queer desire generally

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:58.333
sort of like operates at
the margins of that stuff

01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:01.000
which I think is like, awesome.

01:05:01.958 --> 01:05:06.250
Like I think that's a great
position of liberation

01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:10.458
for queer art except when
you are like being liberated

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:15.375
from ever getting a decent
wage for your creative product.

01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:18.208
But you know, Queercore is punks.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.500
They weren't trying to
get the big record deal.

01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:24.375
Maybe Pansy Division was, I don't know.

01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:31.083
- I'm Kurt Loder with MTV News.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:33.292
Queer punk, Homocore,
whatever you call them

01:05:33.583 --> 01:05:35.125
there's a new breed of
proudly gay punk bands

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:36.958
making a big noise these days.

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:39.167
Chief among them, San
Francisco's delightfully poppy

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:41.292
Pansy Division, which got
a lot of attention after

01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:43.083
Green Day hired the
group as its opening act

01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:44.792
on a US tour last fall.

01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:48.000
- Green Day, when they
reached that major label level

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:51.000
wanted to show where they came from

01:05:52.208 --> 01:05:54.750
and so they were taking all
these different lookout bands

01:05:55.042 --> 01:05:57.792
on tour with them, but we happened to be

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:00.292
on the tour where they broke.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.167
- Green Day kind of were
ahead of their time too.

01:06:04.458 --> 01:06:06.792
They represent that kind
of punk consciousness where

01:06:07.083 --> 01:06:10.708
they're not gay, but
they knew it wasn't right

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.792
to pick on somebody for
being different in any way.

01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:21.167
And I think they got a big
kick out of Pansy Division's

01:06:21.458 --> 01:06:23.208
lyrics because some of
them were pretty funny

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.375
and they got even a bigger
kick out of shocking

01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:32.292
their suburban fans in these
fairly generic audiences,

01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:33.833
last year they were
watching whatever other

01:06:34.125 --> 01:06:35.958
mainstream that came through.

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.708
- I just thought they're
just a great band,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
you know they're really catchy, and, uh,

01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:45.042
I think it, you know, there's
a lot you know more to

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:48.708
punk rock than Green Day
and The Offspring videos,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:49.708
that's for sure.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.917
- Green Day were kind of
like, "They need to know

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:55.167
"we're not like one of
those mainstream rock acts.

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:57.375
"We're something different
and if you doubt that,

01:06:57.667 --> 01:06:59.542
"here is Pansy Division."

01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:02.875
- That was the biggest
thing in popularizing us

01:07:03.167 --> 01:07:06.083
'cause we had never expected
to play at 15,000 seat arenas.

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:09.125
We were thinking that 150 people to see us

01:07:09.417 --> 01:07:11.042
was a really big crowd.

01:07:11.333 --> 01:07:12.417
♪ Unless you'd rather
go home and masturbate ♪

01:07:12.708 --> 01:07:15.000
♪ Reciprocate, reciprocate ♪

01:07:15.292 --> 01:07:18.208
- A lot of Pansy Division
audiences are straight punk kids,

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.208
and it always bewildered me,
they have more straight fans

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.458
than gay ones.

01:07:22.458 --> 01:07:26.500
But, other times they got
stuff throwing at them and all,

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:31.542
but Green Day were like "As
long as you can take it,

01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:33.125
"we're are proud to have you."

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:36.417
And I know Pansy Division
they treasured that

01:07:36.708 --> 01:07:38.333
until this days, and Green Day,

01:07:38.625 --> 01:07:39.792
they still remember it, too.

01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:43.042
I think it was a pretty awesome thing.

01:07:45.042 --> 01:07:47.792
- Everybody is a fag,
haven't you realized it?

01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:49.625
The whole goddamn world's a fag,

01:07:49.917 --> 01:07:52.167
don't you know that even yet?

01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:06.500
- As far as I know no one
called this movement Homocore

01:08:06.792 --> 01:08:09.292
until it was kind of over, really.

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:13.292
And people who weren't
involved, got involved.

01:08:13.583 --> 01:08:16.042
And the Queercore thing I'm
pretty sure specifically came

01:08:16.333 --> 01:08:17.417
out of Chicago.

01:08:17.708 --> 01:08:20.750
- There was a kind of crossover between

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:23.750
the idea of a gay punk movement and

01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:27.333
these kind of queer radicals

01:08:28.333 --> 01:08:31.875
who were more within the gay scene.

01:08:32.167 --> 01:08:34.917
So there was a kind of a
merger at a certain point.

01:08:35.208 --> 01:08:37.417
- I just started
out with the name Homocore,

01:08:37.708 --> 01:08:41.000
but it began to be obvious
that a certain type

01:08:41.292 --> 01:08:44.958
of male audience thought
it was only about gay men.

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:46.917
So I thought, "Oh my god
I gotta do something.

01:08:47.208 --> 01:08:49.542
"It can only be interesting
and valuable if it

01:08:49.833 --> 01:08:52.792
"includes everyone, so if
we have to change the name,

01:08:53.083 --> 01:08:54.208
"we'll do that."

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:59.333
- From about 90, 91,
'til about '95 which is

01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:04.167
contemporaneous with riot
grrrl, there really was

01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:06.750
a more finite number of
bands, but then there

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.000
was just an explosion.

01:09:08.292 --> 01:09:10.167

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:35.542
- By the
mid-1990s, thousands of people

01:09:35.833 --> 01:09:38.250
belonged to the international movement.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:42.125
They changed the name from
Homocore to Queercore.

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:45.458
The band Extra Fancy was
signed to a major label

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:47.208
and then dropped a few months later

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.208
after news outlets
published the lead singer's

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.958
HIV positive status.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:56.125
Record stores had an ever
expanding Queercore section.

01:09:56.417 --> 01:09:59.542
Some musicians tried to
reclaim the pink triangle.

01:09:59.833 --> 01:10:02.375
The bands didn't really
have a unifying sound,

01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:04.958
but they shared a strong political vision.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:07.875
What had come to be was maybe
something that G.B. Jones,

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:11.625
Bruce LaBruce, Tom and
Deke hadn't intended,

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:14.458
the first generation was ready to move on.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:17.333
At the height of its
popularity Bruce wrote:

01:10:17.625 --> 01:10:20.000
"Queercore is dead, our son is dead.

01:10:20.292 --> 01:10:21.292
"I killed him.

01:10:21.583 --> 01:10:25.042
"Utopian ideologies hatched
in cold basement apartments

01:10:25.333 --> 01:10:27.375
"on long lonely nights
never really stand up

01:10:27.667 --> 01:10:28.958
"to the light of day."

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:31.792
But it didn't really matter
to the audience or the bands,

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:35.583
they kept playing and
the message was loud.

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:45.542
- Action!

01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:02.750
- I always had the drive of cinema.

01:11:03.042 --> 01:11:05.417
When I did Queercore
I made Queercore films

01:11:05.708 --> 01:11:08.708
and then I still make
Queercore style films.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.458

- I definitely started
Peaches thinking about

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.917
how can I bring back
the riot grrrl attitude

01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:53.000
and the, um, just rock
riffs but new, new sounds

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:57.208
from really arty electronics
and things like that.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.125
But I felt really sad
about riot grrrl culture

01:12:02.542 --> 01:12:05.042
because it became such
a media hype and then

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:08.208
of course it had to die
out in the media sense

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.750

- Peaches and Beth Ditto and The Knife,

01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:40.375
and I mean they've all broken through

01:12:40.667 --> 01:12:44.208
slightly more mainstream, which is great.

01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:54.000
- I feel really fortunate to
be a part of the queer scene,

01:12:54.292 --> 01:12:55.792
because I came from a place where there

01:12:56.083 --> 01:12:56.833
wasn't a queer community, it was like

01:12:57.125 --> 01:13:00.542
me and another kid and maybe
a couple of other kids.

That's what I did, I found

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.917
and amazing, I can't believe I found them,

01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:17.958
I can't believe I even
met them in Arkansas.

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:19.833
Find your people, stick to our people,

trust them and stay together.

01:13:22.458 --> 01:13:23.917
- When the Gossip first started
out they were definitely

01:13:24.208 --> 01:13:26.042
more of a punk rock sound and now I think

01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:28.375
it's more of, a like disco,

01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:34.917
housey-soul kind of sound,
pop almost, in a sense.

01:13:35.917 --> 01:13:37.875
But definitely the idea

01:13:38.167 --> 01:13:42.417
and the identity of punk rock
is still really huge with us.

01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:45.583
♪ I knew that it was ♪

01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:46.708
♪ In the picture perfect world ♪

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.875
Through music I think
there is so much to say,

01:13:49.167 --> 01:13:52.083
and queer music definitely saved my life

01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:54.458
when I was teenager so
I know that it has that

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.125
affect on other people,

01:13:56.417 --> 01:13:59.167
and when I meet fans
and they tell me that,

01:13:59.458 --> 01:14:00.958
it is the best feeling in the world

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:04.542
to know that I've inspired
somebody or helped them

01:14:04.833 --> 01:14:07.000
through their experience,
like helped them feel not

01:14:07.292 --> 01:14:10.667
so alone or not so stigmatized
or to see a person in

01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:13.333
the public eye being who they
are and talking about it,

01:14:13.625 --> 01:14:15.208
not being ashamed.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:20.083
Getting out there to a
wider audience is awesome.

01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:21.667
- I definitely think that
a lot of us would have

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.500
kept on doing drugs and would
have died, and wouldn't have

01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:29.292
ever put a band together if
we hadn't of had the support

01:14:30.875 --> 01:14:33.958
of an entire community the way we did.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:38.083
It was super.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.417
It was really brilliant,
and healing and amazing

01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:45.500
to have that happen
when you grow up queer,

01:14:45.792 --> 01:14:48.042
and like you're all having
crushes on girls and stuff,

01:14:48.333 --> 01:14:50.958
and everybody is like not really.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:52.917
You know there is a lot
of damage that happens

01:14:53.208 --> 01:14:55.292
and like, you kind of hate yourself.

01:14:55.583 --> 01:14:57.250
That's why I did drugs
and drank, I was like,

01:14:57.542 --> 01:15:00.208
"Oh, I suck, everyone thinks I suck."

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.792
And then jumping on stage and being like

01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:04.292
"Actually we don't suck,
we're fucking awesome",

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.875
and having everybody go
"That's right, you are."

01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:09.792
It's like, we're awesome.

01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:12.042
It's awesome to be queer.

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:18.667
It changed everything, you know.

01:15:28.667 --> 01:15:33.542
- Queercore was probably
the last cultural movement

01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:35.667
that queers participated in.

01:15:35.958 --> 01:15:39.333
The amazing thing I think is
that it was not just zines,

01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:42.958
not just music, it was
pretty much every medium.

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:47.208
And as a cultural movement I
don't think it can be rivaled

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.000
by any other queer
movement that's happened.

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:05.958
- Queercore was a
socio-political movement really.

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:09.083
I mean, it brought a lot
of cultural visibility

01:16:09.375 --> 01:16:12.708
to the gays, to the queers, to the freaks.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.875
And that definitely helps
with all the people working

01:16:16.167 --> 01:16:19.875
on the political angles,
political representation,

01:16:20.167 --> 01:16:22.542
and civil rights issues.

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:24.500
And people that they are
doing the technical work

01:16:24.792 --> 01:16:26.292
to move those things forward,

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:31.333
they need the freaks on the
edges doing the cultural work.

01:16:31.625 --> 01:16:34.250
That was us, freaks on the edges.

01:16:34.542 --> 01:16:38.250
- It's very tempting, I think,
to say that the revolution's

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:42.125
been won and now just everybody
live happily ever after.

01:16:42.417 --> 01:16:45.750
I think that's a dangerous
way to, to, to look at it.

01:16:46.042 --> 01:16:48.375
On one hand, you can think
, well, that's great,

01:16:48.667 --> 01:16:51.125
you know you no longer
need to live in a ghetto,

01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:55.583
you no longer need to only
hang out with your own kind,

01:16:55.875 --> 01:17:00.583
and yet something seems to
be lost at the same time too.

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:03.875
What I feel is that people
are still gonna have

01:17:04.167 --> 01:17:08.792
to keep reinventing themselves,
and I would really hope

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:13.208
that people keep pushing and
keep you know, challenging.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.375
I think there's still
plenty of room for that,

01:17:15.667 --> 01:17:17.792
I don't know if somebody
is gonna start, you know,

01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:20.583
the 21st century version
of queer punk or Homocore

01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:23.458
or if it's necessary or even possible,

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:26.958
but people need to keep moving boundaries

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:29.250
and exploring new territories.

01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:33.167

is to be a human being.
