00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.399
Put your head like this, with
the weight on your forehead.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.360
Make sure your feet are properly
balanced, then up you go.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.040
<b>THE BEST WAY TO WALK</b>

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.560
Kids! What are you doing?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.800
Can't you see it's raining?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.320
SUMMER 1960

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.079
- "Henri, is that you?"
- "Yes, Princess.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.999
"I came in through the garden."

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.319
"You risked your life
to be here.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.559
- "Henri, you're crazy!"
- "Crazy about you, Princess!"

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.960
WELCOME TO SUMMER CAMP

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.439
- Line up!
- We won!

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.720
Quenty! Monestier!

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.360
Didier, from
"Crazy about you, Princess."

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.239
"Crazy about you, Princess."

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.200
"Keep quiet, you fool.
My father despises you."

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.799
In our group
There is no deadwood

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.440
There are dunces
But they're all good...

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.720
Hurry up.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.000
Put down your shield.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.839
In our group
There is no deadwood

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.000
We have dunces
But they're all good...

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.160
Shut up! Wipe your feet!
Dacosta, your feet! Shit!

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.479
What is this racket?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.479
What the hell are you doing?

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.959
- Have you noticed it's raining?
- Don't catch a cold, OK?

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.640
They can make as much noise as
they want outside, but not here.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.880
That's not funny!

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.920
Why aren't you in bed?

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.360
Sleep on your right side.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.080
- Don't pretend!
- Aren't you ashamed to cry?

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.840
What are you doing? Go to bed.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.920
Now get some sleep. OK?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.720
Why are you still up? Go to bed!

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.280
Hurry!

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.880
Thierry...

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.440
OK, lights off. Stop reading.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.000
- Good night!
- Good night, Philippe!

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.999
- Hi.
- Evenin'.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.839
- Poker?
- No, I'll watch the movie.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.839
On TV? It's great!
I've seen it six times.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.439
- Up to no good, are we?
- What's that?

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.679
This, my dear son,
is a suggestion box.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.839
You'll find out more tomorrow.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.999
It needs to be repainted.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.039
- For the "Farewell Feast"?
- Exactly.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.279
The kids'll like that.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.880
- G'night.
- Good night, Mr. Director.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.879
- Will you watch it too?
- No, it's the original version.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.200
I hate subtitles!

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.080
Stop!

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.840
I had humiliating dreams
while I slept.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.159
Shut up, Deloux!

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.359
- If we're disturbing you...
- Let us know.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.919
- Simmer down.
- The movie's too confusing.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.399
- You don't have a degree.
- He's an illiterate!

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.440
Shut up!
We're trying to watch a movie!

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.080
Deloux's riled up!

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.560
I mean, really!

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.360
You can't handle the truth.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.680
I was too considerate,
which is why people

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.560
unwittingly become cruel.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.640
I understand.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.959
- Bastards!
- Are you happy now?

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.359
Watch your goddamn movie!
We'll be quiet.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.359
- Come on, Philippe.
- No, it's OK. I'm tired.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.599
We were just having fun.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.959
Won't you stay
and catch the ending?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.600
- Deloux! Shut up!
- G'night, guys.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.439
Read this, please.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.240
I'm a doctor, not a philologist.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.880
- Sure he's OK?
- What do you think?

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.959
I'm not a pervert
But I'm well aware...

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.199
That blonde-haired women
Have black hair down there.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.280
- Stop fooling around. Two pair.
- Not enough. Full house!

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.839
Let's use his flashlight.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.080
No way!
Don't waste my batteries!

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.759
Philippe?

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.159
- What?
- Lend us some candles?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.719
- Wait.
- I'm coming in.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.600
Wait!

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.240
What?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.480
You use candles in your plays.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.720
We'd like to keep playing poker.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.720
He's back!

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.240
- Some candles!
- Candles drive me bonkers.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.800
Some guys do nasty
things with candles.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.000
- You, maybe?
- Jerk!

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.279
You're like Deloux.
You like sordid stories.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.400
- Yeah, right.
- I know.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.080
Bigmouths are always
innocent, right?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.560
- That guy's such a jerk!
- What are you doing?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.639
- He's having sweet dreams.
- Are we playing or what?

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.160
I had a full house. Your turn.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.279
A ghost!

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.320
I can't sleep
because of the storm.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.080
Are you ready to deal? Go ahead.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.720
It works better
with electricity.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.639
- Oh, yeah.
- He's still sleeping!

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.559
- You're welcome to play.
- Thanks, I'll go back to bed.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.080
Another intellectual!

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.639
- Marc?
- Yes?

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.599
Don't you have something
to tell me?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.680
Who, me? Like what?

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.480
Philippe, come take a look.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.519
- Hello, Mr. Lambert.
- Hello, Philippe.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.480
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Philippe.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.280
I'll give you back
the candles later.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.839
- Looks great, no?
- It's not bad.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.679
Spruce it up with some paint.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.279
It'll hide all the fingerprints.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.399
Stay hidden back here.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.000
You come out when the princess
and Henri hold hands.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.960
Make sure the spotlights
are pointed at the king.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.800
OK, Jean-Paul,
"Keep quiet, you fool."

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.159
"Keep quiet, you fool.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.239
"My father despises you.
His soldiers are after you."

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.640
"My sweet Princess,
your hand upon my heart..."

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.479
"Confound it!

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.079
"What do I see? My daughter
with that scoundrel!"

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.600
It keeps coming off!

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.759
No, this is very serious.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.080
Your daughter loves the son
of your worst enemy.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.800
You two, be serious.
They're truly in love.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.640
Yeah, very funny. Hold his hand.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.999
Jean-Paul,
you're the young girl.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.519
You're shaking before
your lover. Go on...

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.199
"My sweet Princess,
your hand upon my heart..."

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.240
"Confound it! What do I see..."

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.800
Wait.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.999
We hate fairies
We say it loud and clear

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.799
They don't like it
We don't want 'em here

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.439
The best way to walk
Is still our way

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.680
Left foot, right foot
Today and every day...

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.199
That's enough! Damn!

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.480
If you're not interested,
let me know, I don't care...

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.160
We can do something else.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.040
SUGGESTION BOX

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.600
Dear campers, dear counselors,

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.359
today I wish to talk to you

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.800
about our "Farewell Feast."

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.079
I'm sure you've all noticed...

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.359
How shall I call it...?
This box. It's like a mailbox.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.120
- Did you notice it?
- Yes!

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.440
Silence!

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.399
We wrote on it "suggestion box."

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.959
Why is that?

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.759
Each of you

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.600
has the right and duty

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.760
to jot down on a piece of paper
his own suggestions...

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.119
...so that this year's
Farewell Feast

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.120
will be an exceptional success!

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.439
Write down as many suggestions
as you like

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.640
and drop them into the slot
intended for that purpose.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.320
Let me finish, please.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.879
A few days before the feast,
we'll open the suggestion box.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.599
Every suggestion will be read

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.399
by the counselors and myself.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.599
The camper who makes
the best suggestion

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.600
will be named "Honor Camper."

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.559
That's a great idea.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.759
The introspective Deloux loves
the sound of his master's voice.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.119
Bootlicker!

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.359
- It's an educational exercise.
- I can picture the smut!

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.240
Let's go!

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.199
Behave!

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.040
What's so funny?

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.120
What is it? What's wrong?

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.960
- Tell me what's wrong.
- It's Frédéric.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.719
- What'd he do?
- He won't talk to me.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.640
Is that why you're crying?

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.399
Stop talking to him too.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.000
- To punish him.
- Make him talk to me.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.200
- Yes?
- It's Marc. Can we come in?

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.320
Of course. Come in.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.639
We're returning these.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.040
Thanks.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.880
- I'll put 'em... here.
- Wherever you like.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.080
- Your fiancée?
- We're not engaged.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.840
Your girlfriend?

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.960
She's cute.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.879
- What's her name?
- Chantal.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.159
It bothers him
to talk about her.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.879
- Not at all.
- Yes!

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.320
It's obvious it bothers you.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.600
She has a sensual mouth!

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.760
You're always reading books.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.320
Books...

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.479
...are for jerkoffs, my friend!

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.240
Let's split.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.320
I think people who are
always busy reading...

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.960
Some lesson!

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.880
- Right on my Merleau-Ponty!
- What? What'd you say, Deloux?

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.480
Léni! Sing us some blues!

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.480
- Who is it?
- Philippe.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.600
Come in.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.439
- I'm always ready.
- Were you sleeping?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.719
Yes.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.999
- OK, I'll be off.
- No way!

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.880
You're here, so sit down.
What is it?

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.040
Sit down!

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.320
I wanted to talk to you about
something I find disquieting.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.960
"Disquieting"?

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.639
Look...

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.879
I know it's late.
It sounds stupid...

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.679
It's kind of difficult
to explain.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.000
But I think...

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.960
...the groups shouldn't
be kept apart.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.719
Well said.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.919
- Making fun?
- Not at all.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.319
I mean...

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.640
Each counselor has
his group of boys...

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.000
...but the groups
never really mingle.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.119
And...

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.400
- That's keeping you up?
- Yes.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.959
Shouldn't your group and mine
play the same games?

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.399
Why are the groups separate?

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.680
It'd be better
if we had one big group.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.080
Our groups should do
the same activities.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.479
I'm here for the money, I'm not
into educational activities.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.040
- Really?
- Yes.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.800
Can I have one?

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.719
In any case, no...

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.919
It's too late.
The teams are already set.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.239
I'm sorry to have
to tell you, but...

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.759
You try to teach them through
song, dance, theater...

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.319
You can do whatever you like.
It bores the hell out of me.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.680
I'm sure my kids would
feel the same way.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.079
Did you talk to Deloux?

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.520
He'd love that, no?

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.119
- So long.
- Wait! Don't take it bad.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.319
- You're too touchy.
- No, it doesn't matter.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.960
I told you to wait.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.239
Is that it?

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.199
Yes.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.279
Our groups should play together?

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.919
We can try. Give me a hand.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.279
- How?
- Let me finish...

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.639
If you help me, I'll make
sure my kids play sports.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.079
I've been shirking my duties.
In a way, I'm guilty.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.960
What? I didn't understand.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.359
Being the camp director's son...

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.319
Don't be silly. Of course not.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.000
I don't know why, but...
Things aren't going well for me.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.800
You create your own problems.
Your books don't help.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.440
I don't understand.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.560
Don't the others have problems?

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.240
Why are you telling me all this?

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.439
It's only natural.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.640
I'm confiding in you because...

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.800
- Everyone admires you.
- Yeah, right!

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.279
I'm a bigmouth,
so people listen.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.800
Here, have a drink.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.800
So?

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.640
Actually...

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.800
I'd like you...
I want us to be friends.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.560
"Friends"?

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.000
We are, aren't we?

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.040
It's tough to say, huh?

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.680
But...

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.760
What do you mean
by "being friends"?

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.999
What does it mean?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.679
What I just told you.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.760
Make the kids play together.
Exchange views.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.800
I see...

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.520
Shit!

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.320
I... I'm sorry.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.520
- Small favors too.
- What?

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.119
Favors we can do for each other.
Or for me.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.840
Sure. That goes without saying.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.920
- Does saying it help?
- Yes.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.760
- You agree, then?
- Yes.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.559
But...

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.680
What exactly do you mean?
You want me to do you a favor?

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.879
It doesn't matter.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.880
I don't know yet.
Maybe at some point.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.439
After all, we're friends now.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.880
It's good to know
we can count on someone.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.480
Out!

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.679
Let me see.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.879
We treated you right away.
Tell your parents that.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.079
Don't overdo it.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.520
Your group doesn't measure up.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.359
- What's with the smirk?
- Today we'll do some drama.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.240
"Today we'll do some drama."

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.760
The battle scene.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.880
I want Marc's group up here.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.280
Manu, fetch the swords.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.759
Are you listening?

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.279
Stay behind the old king.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.959
You two, come here.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.319
Read your lines, turn to
the marshal and say them.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.559
- "Just spare my daughter."
- Good.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.639
And then you charge.
You know what you have to do.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.759
OK, let's rehearse.
Remember, this is theater.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.200
It's just for fun.
It doesn't count for marks.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.120
OK, ready? Lights!

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.719
Go ahead, Didier.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.279
"My lord, this is our fate.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.279
"I shall be brave
until the very end."

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.200
"You have sullied my honor.
Give me back Isabelle."

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.759
"Soldiers,
we must save our kingdom."

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.720
"Just spare my daughter."

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.320
- Enjoying it, huh?
- This was your idea.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.280
Are you nuts?

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.319
Someone lent it to me.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.879
- You like naked women?
- Yeah, they're fun to look at.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.239
Don't you dare look
at stuff like this!

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.119
Confiscated.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.640
What's that racket?

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.480
It's time to nap.
Sleep on your right side.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.120
You're out of shape.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.359
Was the play a trick?

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.559
You did that on purpose?

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.479
I don't understand.
What'd I do on purpose?

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.800
Why would I have done that?

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.440
You seem to enjoy
pissing me off.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.400
Why?

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.679
- Why?
- You think I don't notice?

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.039
You're trying mighty hard
to piss me off.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.280
You're out to get me.
You think I don't know?

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.239
Because you saw me
the other night?

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.399
Because you saw me in my room?

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.999
- So you figure...
- I don't care about that.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.439
- It's none of my business.
- Then why do you pick on me?

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.639
You said I could do you a favor.
What is it you want?

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.039
Our friendship
is all ballsed up.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.839
Stop with the double entendres.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.239
In my room at night,
I do the same thing as you.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.399
The same thing as you, buddy.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.160
And if it isn't the same thing,
it makes no difference.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.559
- I don't have special problems.
- I'm not so sure.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.239
Wait! Maybe you hide
yours better.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.559
I can also walk into your
room without warning.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.600
- What'll I see?
- Yes, what?

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.720
- I'll find something.
- What?

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.560
Your dark secrets.
Stuff that makes you hard.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.639
As my dear grandmother
used to say,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.320
"You're off your onion."

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.719
You're off your onion, buddy.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.639
It means you're screwed up,
that you're nuts.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.799
But you came to me.
Funny, isn't it?

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.879
"I want us to be friends."

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.600
You need me on your side.
Are you worried I'll tell?

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.640
You wouldn't.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.919
Pathetic.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.359
You're a jerkoff.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.280
You're shitting in your pants.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.959
I couldn't care less
about a guy like you,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.400
Mr. Camp Director's son.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.920
I couldn't care less.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.079
"My love,

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.479
"You absolutely have
to find a way

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.799
"to come here on Sundays.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.800
"I absolutely need to..."

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.960
- Need something?
- No.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.920
I thought maybe you did.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.960
Come in.
181 START an 898 (CHF -.50/SMS)

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.160
Want some?

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.680
- Laughing at me?
- No!

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.839
Gérard told us a good one.
It's kinda gross.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.719
Tell it to Philippe.
You'll love it.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:34.799
- No, not twice in a row.
- Gérard! Say it again.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.360
- OK, I will.
- Maybe he's heard it.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.560
There's this guy...
He's married.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.319
One night,
after 10 years of marriage,

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.879
after he slips into bed
with his wife,

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.799
he tells her
to lie on her tummy.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.280
Suddenly, he buggers her!

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.799
Wait...

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.519
His wife's surprised.
She's not used to that.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.199
But she lets him. She's nice.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:18.879
The husband comes and falls
asleep without saying a word.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.559
The next day,
he doesn't speak to his wife.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.560
That night, same thing.
She rolls over, he buggers her.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:34.279
The husband comes and falls
asleep without saying a word.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.719
This goes on
for weeks and months,

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.279
even a whole year.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.879
Every night, he'd bugger his
wife without talking to her.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.759
His wife, after putting up
with a year of silence...

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.639
She can't stand it anymore.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.599
She's upset.
She demands an explanation.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.279
She says, "Listen, Alphonse...

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.079
"Take me as you want.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.079
"But I am your wife.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.519
"Talk to me.
Tell me what's going on."

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.120
He tells her,
"I don't talk to perverts."

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.120
Can you lend me your songbook?

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.200
What? I asked you a question.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.280
You could at least answer me.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.440
Sorry, I don't talk to perverts.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.440
Jerks.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.520
- Here comes the halberdier.
- I've had enough!

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.080
- It's cold!
- Stop!

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.839
It's very cold.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.599
Don't pretend, you bastard.
Answer me!

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.519
You keep complaining,
but at least you have hot water

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.200
in your room.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.160
What do you want?

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.920
- What?
- What favors?

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.919
I don't know.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.200
Not yet, anyway.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.280
What could I possibly ask you?

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.959
Are you otherwise happy?

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.559
What?

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.120
Despite what you may think,

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.479
I haven't told anyone.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.439
I'm nice.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.640
I'm sure you did.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.880
Think whatever you like.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.720
Your fiancée's coming
tomorrow, right?

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.679
What's her name again?

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.440
Pretty Chantal.
I really like Chantal.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.119
Say, she's...
She's something, huh?

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.560
Is she a good lay?

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.920
Does she give head?

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.479
No need to blush.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.559
That's what guys and girls do.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.199
Love, sex, hair.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.639
Don't you know that?

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.279
I doubt you can hurt her.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.359
I'll bet you've never done it.
Am I right?

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.239
She sure must miss it.
Maybe she's getting some.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.640
Other guys must be humping her.
She's only human.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.839
If a guy had told me
what I just told you,

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.599
I'd have ripped his face off.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.400
You didn't even react.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.960
How pitiful!

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.600
I've had my fill of talking.
Get lost!

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.920
Get lost!

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.079
You haven't changed much
in a month.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.560
- Meaning?
- Still talkative.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.760
I really enjoyed your letter.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.480
It's a good thing I wrote first.
You don't reveal too much.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.720
Girls aren't supposed to write first.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:00.440
Your letters used to be flowery.
But not this time.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.080
"You absolutely have to come."

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.480
Actually,
I like the "absolutely."

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.399
The haircut was a good idea.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.640
It really suits you.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.520
Say... I rented a room
for this afternoon.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.840
What for?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.080
Are you nuts?

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.280
You're really out of it.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.039
Forget it.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.839
We can't spend
the afternoon indoors.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.919
- We're expecting showers.
- Introduce me to your friends.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.040
No.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.879
- I want to see your dad.
- What about me?

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.760
Please!

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.079
- You know Sophie...
- Yes.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:17.039
Believe it or not, she went
camping with Jean-Claude.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.559
- Did you know?
- She does whatever she likes.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.440
Check, please.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.840
No. I'm afraid.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.720
IT DOESN'T MATTER
I LOVE YOU

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.280
You'll miss it.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.719
You know...

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.999
I heard that it isn't always
easy the first time, so...

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.800
You think so?

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.160
Don't worry. See you next week.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.519
I found the whole
series in his room.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.199
Bravo, Deloux. Nice going!

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.960
Come see me in my office,
young man.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.959
Say, buddy...

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.960
The shame!

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.479
I'm not surprised.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.439
He didn't pay his rent
or do his share.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.520
Pass me the cheese.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.640
This reminds me of a woman
I used to love.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:46.199
- What do you think?
- That it isn't very funny.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.880
Do you think it's sad?

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.439
No big deal.
These things happen.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.199
Want my beans?
I can't finish 'em.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.719
No, thanks.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.839
I know you love
the food we serve here.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.559
- No, thanks.
- Yes, thanks.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.600
- I'm not hungry.
- Beans promote regularity.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.320
"I absolutely have to talk
to you, you bastard."

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.880
- I received a strange message.
- If you're gonna make fun...

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.880
Tell me what it is you want.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.440
I'm fed up, I'm through playing.

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.160
What's the "small favor"?

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.880
I can suck your cock,
if you like.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.759
- I know nothing about that.
- Just leave me alone.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.600
I don't need you.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.240
I could kill myself.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.080
But I'll say it was your fault.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.720
- You've made my life hell.
- What are you saying?

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.320
What are you talking about?

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.879
Let's just say I forgot, OK?

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.199
I pissed you off a little.
Now it's over, OK?

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.080
It's all over.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.160
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.280
I know you're honest.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.279
"The Sunday we spent together
wasn't very merry.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:04.159
"But that doesn't matter.
I really want to see you again.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.999
"I get the feeling something
is troubling you.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.359
"I think I should visit
you more often.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.639
"I can come back next Sunday.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.080
"I hope I can make it
every Sunday.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:24.999
"Don't torture yourself if we
still haven't you-know-what.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.319
"Maybe we're a little young.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.719
"It takes time for us
to get to know each other.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.319
"But it's not that you
don't appeal to me.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.839
"I love you very much.
I love your body.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.279
"And I'm not at all afraid.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.439
"But I'm also well aware
we both have certain needs.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.200
"I know we can't help it.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.999
"I hope you won't show
anyone this letter.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.560
"I love you dearly. Chantal."

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.719
How are you?

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.760
He came to pick up his chick!

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.880
Coming.

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.079
- Hi.
- Marc, Chantal.

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.919
You're Chantal?
He's told me a lot about you.

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.880
- Were you planning to split?
- Not at all.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.879
I'll see you this afternoon
at the pool for the tournament.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:16.040
Looks like we have no choice.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.440
I'm counting on you. 'Bye.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.399
- You kept your sweatsuit on?
- I was working this morning.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.800
I have to go back to change.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.240
- I'll just be a minute.
- Chantal! Great to see you.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.240
I'll be right back.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.719
It doesn't always work.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.240
It's nice of you to come
visit us on Sundays.

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:45.480
- Did Philippe abandon you?
- No, he's getting dressed.

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.320
- Is Philippe your fiancé?
- No.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.359
- So he's your boyfriend?
- I guess so.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.640
- That's funny.
- Why?

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.600
I'm amazed, that's all.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.399
Let me tell you...

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.879
A guy with a pin in his eye

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.520
isn't concerned about the
future of the British navy.

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.720
Know what I mean?

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.120
Why don't you eat with us?
Just this once.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.720
Don't you like us?

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.559
I don't like the way

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:35.240
you order people around
and expect them to obey.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.400
That was some blow! Philippe!

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.879
Your girlfriend won't
eat with us.

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.239
- We made reservations.
- You shouldn't exclude us.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:59.279
- We'd rather not.
- What?

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.160
We'd rather not eat with you.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.879
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, what?

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.360
I'm locked inside.
The doorknob is broken.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.800
No!

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.840
- You have to jump!
- It's not too far down.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.080
Come on!

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.559
No, don't do that. No, Philippe.

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:37.039
Philippe, get down now.
Be careful!

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.999
Wait. I'll tell you what to do.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.439
See that iron thing on the
wall for the shutters?

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.279
See it? No, not the nail.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.799
Farther away.
Don't touch it.

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.800
It's useless.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.839
Your pocket!

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.000
Be careful!
You tore your pocket.

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.520
He tore his pocket.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:06.959
- Did you get hurt?
- He'll never admit it.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.720
Coming?

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:26.200
- You could be more considerate.
- Don't turn your nose up at us.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.000
See you later at the pool!

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.480
Some sauce?

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.880
What's wrong?

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.599
You were talking at length
to Marc earlier.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.600
What was so interesting?

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.559
I was telling handsome Marc

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.119
that although I'm young,
I used to be even younger.

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.719
Same with everyone around me.

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.559
I was wondering what that meant.

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.080
And that there was some
terrible meaning.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.160
- Are you angry?
- No.

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.879
And don't worry, I hate
everything about that guy.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.720
He's very conceited.

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.479
Do you want to go to the pool?

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.679
Not really. No more than you do.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.440
Then let's not go.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.040
Yes.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.440
It doesn't matter.

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.520
See you later, Dad.

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.840
It turns out we have to go.
My father's giving a speech.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.720
On your marks!

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.800
- What's wrong?
- I have a headache.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.720
Silence!

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.000
Children,

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.279
I have an announcement

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.359
I'd rather not have to make.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.599
Raoul Deloux

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.440
is leaving us.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.800
Our comrade has committed
a serious professional offense.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.439
In an establishment
such as ours,

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.440
that is unacceptable.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.039
Let this serve as an example.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.759
If I've taken measures
in the past,

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.360
you know full well that my main
concern is fairness and justice.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.999
I am aware that in life,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.400
we all have moments of weakness.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.039
Raoul Deloux,
we bid you farewell.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.879
See you soon.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.960
We will keep a good memory
of you despite this.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.759
Talk to them.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.599
It'd be considerate,
classy and...

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.239
- Mr. Deloux will talk to you.
- Damn! You piss me off!

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.840
All of you piss me off!

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.120
- He's swallowing his tongue.
- I'll handle it.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.640
Take him away!

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.760
- He's disgusting!
- Let go of me! My suitcase!

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.680
Do something!

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.520
In the pool!

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.759
- Stop!
- He's sick!

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.840
Everyone in the pool!

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.040
- What are you waiting for?
- Shut up! I'm going in.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.719
- I have to puke.
- Not in front of everyone.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.839
I'll take him to the bathroom.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.039
- I'll come with you.
- I'd rather you didn't.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.640
Wait for me here.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.960
Go ahead.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.720
I can't.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.399
I never can.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.839
Force yourself.
Think of shit, for example.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.880
Stick two fingers
in your mouth, like this.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.839
- That'll make you throw up.
- I don't want to.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.160
I told you to puke!

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.000
There, doesn't that feel better?

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.719
Let go!

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.399
Why'd you throw me in the pool?
And why'd you lie to me?

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.719
- You're still out to get me.
- Is this 'cause of Chantal?

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.839
Shut the hell up!

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.839
- Just leave me alone, OK?
- This is the thanks I get...

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.159
I don't care. Get lost!

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.159
Show some respect, you bastard!

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.680
You're giving me orders?

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.359
When I see you, I feel like...

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.879
I really feel like kicking
your ass around.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.680
I feel like making fun of you.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.480
Pantywaist!

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.000
Look what you did.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.240
Pretty gross.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.480
Now eat your shit!

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.840
Eat it!

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.199
- What's going on?
- I was helping him to vomit.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.239
- He's OK.
- He was screaming.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.399
He's nuts. He claims I hurt him.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.359
- Leave him alone.
- I did leave him alone!

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.599
But then he told me off!
A guy like that...

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.840
Why are you dating
a guy like that?

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.560
No, leave me alone.
Don't come in.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.960
I was going to help you.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.360
What the hell is this?

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.560
Nothing to boast about.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.560
A slew of inanities,
stupidities and insults.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.199
God help me if the parents
get wind of this...

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:31.199
Every nuance of baseness
is in here.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.719
In fact, I sorted them out.
The banal:

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.360
"Screw the guy who reads this."

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:43.959
Please, there's a lot more.
A personal attack:

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.359
"Marcassin is an idiot."

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.239
A riddle:

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.440
"Summer camp stinks and
the director lays it on thick."

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.439
Whatever that means.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.319
Now the insults:

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:05.279
"Philippe's boys are
a bunch of sissies."

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.759
Thank you on behalf of Philippe.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.759
Pornography:

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.200
"Nurse, strip!"

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.439
I could find only
two suggestions,

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:22.280
and I wouldn't call them
brilliant, but here they are:

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.959
"I suggest we get sloshed."

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.719
Or this laconic suggestion:

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.680
"Cock contest."

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.640
I know.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.519
Truly hilarious.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.120
But I'm not laughing.
I await your suggestions.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.799
- We could...
- Go on a trip?

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.759
No! Long bus rides...

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.559
Some kids'll throw up.
No, thanks.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.999
We could organize a tournament.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.039
- Soccer?
- No!

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.719
Something special. Not soccer.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.519
- A picnic?
- Would they like that?

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.159
But it'd have to be different.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.999
- Good food.
- Yeah... No!

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.759
We could organize...
You know...

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.919
- A fair, with stands.
- Good. With prizes to be won.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.559
And the cost? It'd cost plenty.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.719
The stands would have
to charge people...

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.639
The parents probably
won't like the idea.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.199
They're already paying
for summer camp,

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.719
so would they want to shell out
even more money.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.119
Let's go
with the lone suggestion.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.639
The cock contest?

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.519
You jerk! No!

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.919
- A good meal.
- Too boring.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.359
We'll make it more original.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.640
Sunday for dinner,
three candies rather than two.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.240
Hervé, we can do without your
asinine and insipid comments.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.039
- Why not a bike rally?
- Listen to what I have to say.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.279
I'm surprised no one's
thought of this...

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.439
We'll throw a costume party.
We'll invite the whole village.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.559
The parents are welcome
to attend.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.319
It'll be fun to dress up.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.640
We could hold it
at the playground.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.759
"Would you believe that
I am now quite calm?

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.039
"I hadn't been feeling
myself lately.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.439
"We're organizing a ball
for the Farewell Feast.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.359
"Don't come.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.879
"I'm worried you've had enough
of me and my mood swings.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.480
"I'll see you in Paris in a few
days, and I'll explain then.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.119
"I'm sorry if I'm not a simple
guy who's easy to understand.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.159
"I'd like to be.
I kiss you tenderly."

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.079
"I'm sorry, but I'll be there.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.480
"You'll see that I'm right.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.599
"I want to know what you want.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.759
"I want to learn
all your secrets.

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.040
"I want to understand.
I want to teach you mine.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.079
"If we could sleep together
a whole night, like children,

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.399
"everything would work out.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.639
"That's why I'm coming.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.800
"And that's why I love you."

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.799
Chantal!

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.919
I'll bet you've never
drunk whisky, right?

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.640
Come!

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.760
- Where's Phil?
- He's coming.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.440
- Dressed as what?
- You'll see.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.160
Ask me to dance.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.119
- Is he talking to me?
- Looks like it.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.200
Please.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.880
May I?

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.720
- What's the belle's name?
- La Upa.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.599
OK, "La Upa."

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.160
Rumba!

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:35.519
- That's in poor taste.
- Was it ever good?

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.480
I'm in a strange frame of mind.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.879
I like everything.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.919
I love you even more than usual.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.520
You look ravishing tonight.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.200
He's so silly!

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.639
And tonight,
you're a real beauty.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.440
In fact,
you're always beautiful.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.000
Bitch.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.759
- An orange drink?
- Yes, with arsenic.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.920
- What?
- No, I'll drink it straight.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:17.719
- Please, they're staring at us.
- They are? Let them, darling.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.239
My big fool!

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.479
She's totally wacky tonight.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.959
- Won't you offer me a drink?
- For you, anything!

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.280
Let us through!
She wants a drink.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.199
Won't you dance with him now?

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.079
Not tonight.
Tonight is all about you.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:41.119
Tonight, I only wish
to dance with Marc!

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.279
Marc! The toreador!

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:46.599
Get off my case, OK?

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.319
- Marc, this is our night.
- Yes...

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.399
Don't forget about her.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.960
This is the last dance.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.600
Knock it off.
Everyone's staring.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.960
- That's enough. Stop!
- No.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.879
Marc, don't abandon me.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.800
Sir, ask her to stop.
I've had enough, I'm bored.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.040
I'm gonna sock you!

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.800
Are you OK?

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.879
Marc? Marc!

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.520
Shit!

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.359
You're dancing with my lover.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.920
- You're dancing with my lover!
- Get lost!

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.800
What?

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.600
My dear Marc...
Where are they?

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.320
Come, Marc. Now's the time.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.160
What are you afraid of?

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.800
Where does it hurt?

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.999
I'm not scared of being hit.
Get that straight.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.759
I'm ashamed, merely ashamed.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.960
Where you're ashamed, where
you feel itchy, I feel itchy.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.240
Me too!

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.040
Where you scratch, I scratch.
Me too!

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.600
- You'll get hurt.
- Leave me alone!

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.120
Don't be afraid. Be yourself.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.160
He knifed me.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.359
He knifed me!

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.800
He's crazy.

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.440
I'm so sorry...

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.760
A few years later...

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.320
Come see.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.680
Shall we take it?

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.159
- Not so fast. Here he comes.
- Do you like it?

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.239
It does have a certain appeal.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.279
What's not to like?
Spacious, on Rue Mademoiselle...

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.359
- It's noisy, isn't it?
- A little, yes.

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.119
You're not easy clients.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.959
This is the living room.
Quite spacious, as most are now.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:14.279
It's the latest trend:
few rooms, but lots of room.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:18.239
It's best not to buy
too much furniture.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.839
Have you seen the closets?

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.239
A huge closet on the right.
One on the left.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.999
It isn't exactly cheap.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.960
You're wrong.
I'd take it myself if I could.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.599
It's too steep.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:41.479
The agency's fee... We can
work something out. I mean...

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.000
Don't worry.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.799
It's really weird
seeing you again.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.360
It's been ages. How many years?

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.680
He hasn't changed. He's still...

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.759
You've changed a little bit.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.559
You're more... You're prettier.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.680
- When are you getting married?
- "Married"?

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.520
Yes, of course...

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.839
I made that mistake, and now...

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.120
I'll drive you back to the
agency so we can sign the lease.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.999
- After you.
- No, go ahead.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.879
- Go first.
- Listen...

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.160
After you.
