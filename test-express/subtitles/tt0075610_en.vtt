WEBVTT

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.861
In 1963 World in Action made a film
about these seven year old children

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:27.184
they talked about their homes, their
schools and what they wanted to be

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:30.784
they were filmed again
when they were fourteen

00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:34.337
we've brought them all
together to watch the films

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:36.248
because this year
they are twenty-one

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.187
what are they
doing now?

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:46.390
How have they changed?

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.289
What sort of people are they?

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:53.743
Stop it at once!

00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:56.266
Give me a child until he is seven

00:00:56.267 --> 00:00:58.368
and I will give you the man

00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:02.768
When I leave the
school I'm going to..

00:01:03.487 --> 00:01:05.312
Colet Court

00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:10.192
and then I will be going to
Rossminster Boarding School

00:01:10.193 --> 00:01:11.693
if I pass the exam

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:15.371
and then we think I'm going to

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.396
Cambridge and Trinity Hall

00:01:20.162 --> 00:01:22.022
Well...

00:01:22.023 --> 00:01:26.022
before I'm old and that,
enough to get a job

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.328
I'll just walk around and
see what I can find

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.113
I want to be a jockey
when I grow up yeah

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:35.788
When I leave school

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.080
I'm going to The
Dragon School, I might

00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:43.639
and after I might go to
Charterhouse Marlborough

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:45.862
What about university Charlie?

00:01:46.088 --> 00:01:48.232
I might go to Oxford

00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:50.574
What does university mean?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.671
Well...

00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:55.630
Well I don't think I
need to go to university

00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:57.538
'cause I'm not going
to be a teacher

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.582
I don't think you have
to go to university

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.274
if you want to
be an astronaut

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:03.132
When I leave this school

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:06.892
I'm down for Heathfield
and Fairfield Manor

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:11.758
and then maybe I may
want to go to university

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.345
but I don't know
which one yet

00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:17.170
I will buy myself a nice
new made house, you know

00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:20.330
One that's all
nice and comfy

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:22.631
I'm going to work in Woolworths

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.783
Well, going to Africa

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:29.600
and try and teach people
who are not civilised

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.208
to be, more or less good

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.060
When I grow up I'd like to

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:39.322
find out all about
the moon and all that

00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:43.265
It's just that the limitations
of such things as :

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:46.904
What the audience
require and the time

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:49.197
don't allow it to
be a real study

00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:51.300
I mean if we accept this

00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:53.472
then it....

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.756
Okay I think it's probably
good entertainment

00:02:55.757 --> 00:02:57.810
I don't think we've
changed that much

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:00.370
I think we talk,
no I don't mean looks

00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.258
I mean the way we talk I don't
think we've changed that much

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.491
Well you never lose an
Eastend accent do you

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:08.280
I tell you what, as it goes
you've definitely changed

00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:09.481
- You think so yeah?
- In facial

00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:11.505
You haven't changed
a bit have you?

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:13.058
Don't you think so?
I thought I'd got bigger

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.513
You might be about
an inch bigger yeah

00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:16.802
- An inch?
- I know it's unbelievable

00:03:16.803 --> 00:03:19.192
That's something I did notice,
the way our teeth have changed

00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:21.481
Teeth?

00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:22.482
Yes

00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:24.896
- Mine were out like that and I had them
shoved back - Well I noticed the ears actually

00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:28.573
Have you not noticed that a lot of people...
your ears have been made real fun about them

00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:31.918
They've got they're
conclusions settled already

00:03:33.654 --> 00:03:34.513
They must

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:38.594
...met here today
and we've seen the films

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:40.736
and we feel as if we know
everybody who is in the films now

00:03:41.562 --> 00:03:44.106
has broken any class barriers
that could previously existed

00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:46.922
and therefore the film itself has

00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:48.484
possibly defeated its own object

00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:50.544
- They do lead me on a bit don't they
- That's what I mean

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:53.002
and they hype the
program up too much

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:54.003
Yeah

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:57.570
and make that
you're good and I'm bad

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.456
- Or
- Well Vice-versa I think

00:03:59.457 --> 00:04:02.493
- No don't be silly
- No I really do, especially the "7" one

00:04:02.494 --> 00:04:05.190
People tend to read significance
into it that I don't think exists

00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:08.216
One of my friends for instance,
had me pointed out to him as...

00:04:08.217 --> 00:04:10.148
being destined to run the farm

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.663
and being educationally pretty inept,
this is obvious from the film

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.523
At seven Nicholas was at a one room
village school in the Yorkshire Dales

00:04:19.524 --> 00:04:21.270
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:27.049
I don't want to answer that

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.072
I don't want answer
those kind of questions

00:04:32.515 --> 00:04:35.808
I thought that one would
come up because when I was

00:04:36.563 --> 00:04:38.674
When I was doing the
other one somebody said

00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:41.884
"what do you think about girls?" and I
said "I don't answer questions like that"

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:43.562
is that the reason
you're asking it?

00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:45.270
- yeah
- thought so

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.746
The best answer
would be

00:04:50.747 --> 00:04:53.824
to say that I don't answer
questions like that but I mean..

00:04:53.825 --> 00:04:56.481
you know it was what I
said when I was seven

00:04:56.482 --> 00:04:59.554
and it's still the most sensible
but I mean, what about them?

00:05:01.338 --> 00:05:03.369
Well you seemed at fourteen

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.804
very shy of the whole

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:09.078
sexual life, has that changed?

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:11.734
I've tried to make a change yes

00:05:12.164 --> 00:05:16.760
a very definite conscious
effort not to be shy

00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:19.044
to be more outgoing

00:05:19.045 --> 00:05:25.274
and this is actually something I
can put a point to in my own past

00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:28.550
and think yes I did make my
mind up here, here and here

00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:31.554
that I was going to try and
change this, this and this

00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:34.146
"this" being basically
my confidence

00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:34.994
and my

00:05:34.995 --> 00:05:37.266
my sort of approach to

00:05:37.267 --> 00:05:39.170
well this is to
people in general

00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:41.920
When I grow up I'd like to

00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:44.730
find out all about the
moon and all that

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.148
I mean

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.949
I'm not

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.761
when I said that I was interested in physics
and chemistry well I'm not going to do that here

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:54.420
You might be able to
get... somebody to ex...

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.819
will you explain
this to me again

00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:00.350
Nicholas is now in his
2nd year at Oxford University

00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:04.192
Well I'm trying
to be a physicist

00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:06.821
to fill in the detail of

00:06:06.822 --> 00:06:09.282
whenever you meet
somebody at university that

00:06:09.283 --> 00:06:11.004
the standard
question is,

00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:12.759
where are you and
what are you doing?

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.877
and my answer is I'm at Merton
College and I'm doing Physics

00:06:15.878 --> 00:06:18.367
so it doesn't move up and
down and just rotates

00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:20.184
- OK
- Then you put it in

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:21.256
We'll give it a whirl

00:06:21.257 --> 00:06:23.892
So what career are
you going to pursue?

00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:27.917
It depends whether I'll be good
enough to do what I want to really do

00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:33.256
I would like if I can
to do research

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:37.628
Are there any disadvantages in
coming from a small place like this

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.671
and preparing
yourself for Oxford?

00:06:39.672 --> 00:06:43.103
Well it's a rather
different background

00:06:43.397 --> 00:06:47.945
to go any where,
Oxford perhaps especially

00:06:48.835 --> 00:06:53.724
it is a rather more firm
foundation I would've thought

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:55.332
as to your

00:06:56.017 --> 00:06:58.513
character? I don't?
perhaps character

00:06:58.514 --> 00:07:01.093
than being brought
up in the city

00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:03.911
It's a fixed reference
point in a sense

00:07:03.912 --> 00:07:08.189
that sort of earthy life
and death cycle that you get

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.857
living on a farm

00:07:09.858 --> 00:07:14.016
so when something dies it rots
and feeds back into the earth

00:07:14.281 --> 00:07:17.017
Sometimes it's helpful

00:07:17.018 --> 00:07:23.147
in a city where things that some people are
very concerned about seem quite irrelevant

00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:26.637
Is there a new strength
of your father as a farmer

00:07:26.638 --> 00:07:29.088
that you think he's
trying to teach you

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:33.870
Well you get a certain sort of
calmness in some situations

00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:37.961
take things as they come
you become resigned to things

00:07:37.962 --> 00:07:41.947
if the dog's chasing animals in the wrong
direction then you just have to put up with it

00:07:41.948 --> 00:07:46.509
if it won't do as it's told you
become resigned to these things

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.438
I suppose yes that's
one possibility

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.140
come on

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.276
come on lad

00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:03.572
I suppose of all the
seven year olds

00:08:03.573 --> 00:08:06.140
the original ones,
you are the big success

00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:08.953
I am not inclined
to accept that

00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:11.094
Why? You wouldn't
agree with that?

00:08:11.095 --> 00:08:12.940
Well what have I achieved?

00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:17.893
I'm not really prepared to accept that
I've done anything very special yet

00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:21.621
I'd like to think that....I mean I'm
hoping that I might do at some stage

00:08:21.622 --> 00:08:25.346
but I don't really think I've done anything
that you can call a great success

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.543
It would seem really ridiculous to any
of my friends who watch this if I said

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:34.811
"Christ aren't I a great
success, look at me"

00:08:34.812 --> 00:08:37.357
Well what? You know,
what success?

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.689
I can't think of it
in those terms

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.304
I haven't done anything
that can be called success

00:08:44.305 --> 00:08:46.585
nothing out of
the ordinary really

00:08:56.088 --> 00:08:58.266
Singing Waltzing
Matilda in Latin

00:08:58.267 --> 00:09:00.749
at an exclusive pre-preparatory
school in London

00:09:01.044 --> 00:09:02.420
Charles

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.909
Andrew

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.202
and John

00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:09.325
I think it's not a bad
idea to pay for schools

00:09:09.326 --> 00:09:11.069
because if we didn't

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.949
schools would be so
nasty and crowded

00:09:14.296 --> 00:09:16.328
Yes, so do I think so

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:21.496
The poor people would come rushing
in and the man in charge of the school would...

00:09:21.497 --> 00:09:24.986
Would you think there's any truth
in the ideas behind the program that

00:09:24.987 --> 00:09:29.069
certain people have more options
than others and this is undesirable?

00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:34.743
It's certainly true that more people know
they have more options or imagine they have

00:09:34.744 --> 00:09:37.171
I think in practical terms

00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:43.065
the difference in numerical
number of options isn't that great

00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:48.634
the fact is that the three of us know that
there's a whole range of things we can do

00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:53.095
But the mere knowledge creates an option
in itself, so I think we do have more options

00:09:53.096 --> 00:09:57.215
and it is undesirable but it's
very difficult to correct

00:09:57.216 --> 00:09:59.981
I don't think it is
undesirable at all

00:09:59.982 --> 00:10:02.549
I think what's undesirable is
people who have had options

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.490
don't make advantage of them,
take best advantage of them

00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:07.978
but I can't see there's
anything wrong

00:10:07.979 --> 00:10:12.226
as long as people don't abuse the
opportunities and privileges they've had

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:18.471
If people behave responsibly
I think it's very good

00:10:19.193 --> 00:10:21.910
they're the sort of stability
and structure in society

00:10:21.911 --> 00:10:23.697
We've been taught
to expect more

00:10:23.698 --> 00:10:26.783
it's not that because we've
been to private schools

00:10:26.784 --> 00:10:29.315
we're not better
qualified necessarily

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:31.186
- No
- Yes I agree with that

00:10:31.187 --> 00:10:33.075
It's a matter of expectations

00:10:33.076 --> 00:10:35.305
Yes I must say, all this
talk about opportunities

00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:39.150
something I did slightly
object to in the program was

00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:41.075
we were shown at
the age of seven

00:10:41.076 --> 00:10:46.079
outlining the academic career that
most of us did in fact pursue

00:10:46.963 --> 00:10:50.017
each sentence ended up
"John is at Westminster"

00:10:50.018 --> 00:10:51.803
Andrew is at Charterhouse
and everything

00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:55.944
implied that we just sailed through, merely
manifesting an intention at the age of seven

00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:59.401
we didn't show the sleepless nights,
the pouring over our books

00:10:59.402 --> 00:11:00.790
sort of, you know

00:11:00.791 --> 00:11:04.167
all the sweat and toil that
got us through to university

00:11:04.652 --> 00:11:07.526
it was presented as if it
was just part of some

00:11:07.883 --> 00:11:10.420
indestructible birth right that
we went to all these places

00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:14.895
and I thought that was unfair, they didn't
show us having to do beastly jobs in the holidays

00:11:14.896 --> 00:11:17.839
y'know, to make
ends meet and things

00:11:18.485 --> 00:11:22.637
it didn't give a very
real sort of...impression

00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:24.866
The three girls are earning

00:11:25.341 --> 00:11:31.023
income wise they're far better off than
I imagine all three of us are, certainly I am

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.763
and background wise

00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:38.119
in terms of qualifications or the
means of achieving their ends

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.925
they probably have just
as many options as we do

00:11:40.926 --> 00:11:42.175
Jaqueline

00:11:42.176 --> 00:11:44.676
how do you think about
coloured people?

00:11:44.677 --> 00:11:48.487
Well they're nice, they're
just the same as us really

00:11:48.989 --> 00:11:51.187
but, one thing

00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:54.697
it's only 'cause their
skin's brown and we're white

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:57.119
sort of pinkish we are

00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:01.277
Jackie, Lynn and Susan

00:12:01.322 --> 00:12:04.196
they went to primary school
together in the Eastend of London

00:12:04.197 --> 00:12:06.383
Lynn chose to go on
to a grammar school

00:12:06.384 --> 00:12:08.691
and Jackie and Susan
to a comprehensive

00:12:09.053 --> 00:12:12.569
There is a danger that you would
get married at early twenties and

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.575
have children quickly and
then be stuck at home

00:12:16.555 --> 00:12:17.959
have you any thoughts on that?

00:12:18.387 --> 00:12:21.273
- I don't really think about it much
- No

00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:24.295
I don't think I'd eh....

00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:26.717
get married to early

00:12:26.718 --> 00:12:28.749
I'd like to have
a full life first and

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.115
- I'd like to enjoy myself before I...
- Meet people and...yeah

00:12:31.116 --> 00:12:33.927
Before you can commit
yourself to a family

00:12:33.928 --> 00:12:38.459
What would you do if you had
lots of money? about two pounds

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.311
I would buy myself a nice new
made house you know

00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:45.259
one that's all
nice and comfy

00:12:45.566 --> 00:12:49.886
Jackie was married last year and
now lives on a new estate in Essex

00:12:50.074 --> 00:12:53.387
- It's a nice estate
- Yeah - Yeah not bad at all

00:12:53.388 --> 00:12:55.890
What are they like the neighbours?
Have you seen a lot of them or what?

00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:59.722
Well you know, to say hello
to more than anything, I mean

00:12:59.723 --> 00:13:02.477
we borrow things off of her,
which is just as well

00:13:02.478 --> 00:13:05.103
- That's what neighbours are for isn't it?
- Yeah right!

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:09.676
Here, It's a similar colour scheme
down here moving up stairs isn't it?

00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:13.777
Yeah but this was more by
luck than judgement really

00:13:13.778 --> 00:13:16.346
- Was it like this when you came?
- No it was all white

00:13:16.347 --> 00:13:19.082
but you can imagine
the state it was in

00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:24.288
friends had some paint handy so Dad and Mick
just used the rollers and in a day it was done

00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:25.809
two coats, wallop!
that was it

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.406
Susan is still single

00:13:27.407 --> 00:13:29.902
I work for a
travel company

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:34.747
they don't deal with the public, they
deal with groups and company groups

00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:39.860
it's sort of incentive, holidays abroad
and conferences, that sort of thing

00:13:40.157 --> 00:13:44.266
which I like because
I like foreign places

00:13:44.548 --> 00:13:46.287
and I have to do eh....

00:13:46.288 --> 00:13:48.068
I do quite a bit of typing

00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:50.901
but a lot of my work is
involved in making bookings

00:13:50.902 --> 00:13:53.673
and dealing with hotels abroad

00:13:53.674 --> 00:13:57.253
I left school and started work...

00:13:57.254 --> 00:14:00.244
for an Australian bank
and I'm still there

00:14:00.913 --> 00:14:04.010
and I've been there what?
Three and a half years now

00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:07.431
I've done various
jobs within the bank

00:14:09.545 --> 00:14:13.231
I started off as a
telephonist-typist

00:14:13.232 --> 00:14:16.555
which was very interesting actually,
you'd be surprised the sort of calls you get

00:14:19.436 --> 00:14:22.994
Then I went on to work
the NCR machine

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.722
which is the actual machine
that processes the accounts

00:14:26.337 --> 00:14:30.737
and counter work dealing with
clients money and things like that

00:14:30.738 --> 00:14:33.003
I'm going to work
in Woolworths

00:14:33.004 --> 00:14:39.185
Well I'm a school mobile librarian
and assistant to the young peoples office

00:14:39.186 --> 00:14:40.831
Which is where we are now

00:14:41.301 --> 00:14:45.598
and I've been here
since August last year

00:14:48.267 --> 00:14:51.479
Lynn is now married but still
lives and works in the Eastend

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.068
I visit schools
with the van

00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:59.944
where they've not got position to
get into a local library for class visits

00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:01.785
I love working with children

00:15:01.786 --> 00:15:04.813
do you remember on the
last one I wanted to teach?

00:15:04.814 --> 00:15:06.901
Well I didn't get to that

00:15:06.902 --> 00:15:10.484
and seeing how it is
today I'm glad I didn't

00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:13.281
the job situation for
all teachers as it is

00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:17.585
and I think it takes a lot more
patience than I've actually got

00:15:17.586 --> 00:15:19.650
I'm much more at home here

00:15:19.651 --> 00:15:21.295
- Have I stamped yours?
- Yes

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:23.349
I've not stamped yours

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.977
Sleeping Beauty

00:15:26.674 --> 00:15:28.477
I've lost the stamp!

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:33.101
Do you sleep like a beauty?

00:15:33.575 --> 00:15:34.794
What do you say?

00:15:34.807 --> 00:15:36.288
Thank you

00:15:36.474 --> 00:15:41.767
I definitely make a point in
reading all my new books I get in

00:15:41.768 --> 00:15:44.358
It's quite funny, I
take loads of books home

00:15:44.359 --> 00:15:47.767
and people come and say "who
are these kids books on the table?"

00:15:47.768 --> 00:15:50.476
- "They're mine"
- "Oh"

00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:52.360
Then they sort of shut up

00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:57.914
At the moment a career's probably
about the furthest thing from my mind

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:01.493
and I don't really know what I'm aiming
for except to get the house together

00:16:01.857 --> 00:16:07.352
and that can take years, as fast as you replace
one thing something else needs replacing, so ...

00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:10.100
it could just go on like
that, I don't know

00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:13.213
Well admitting that
you're not a career girl

00:16:13.214 --> 00:16:15.753
does it mean that you're
therefore looking for a family?

00:16:15.754 --> 00:16:17.691
Oh I don't know,
I suppose I am

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:20.414
But erm..

00:16:20.415 --> 00:16:22.767
every thing's not
that cut and dried

00:16:22.768 --> 00:16:25.385
it's not either
career or family or...

00:16:25.386 --> 00:16:29.057
but is what's in the middle, am I
just going to carry on as I am now? for?

00:16:29.058 --> 00:16:31.822
and end up .....on the shelf?

00:16:31.823 --> 00:16:34.827
or am I just going to get
married? could be any day, but

00:16:34.925 --> 00:16:37.458
I suppose Lynn is a career
girl in a way isn't she?

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:40.713
Yeah she's more wrapped
up in her job than I think we are

00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:47.143
and you all three were sat there at seven and
she's gone that way and you've gone this way

00:16:47.144 --> 00:16:49.298
is there? can you?....

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:51.434
think of any reasons
why that should be?

00:16:51.435 --> 00:16:55.935
I think just basic personality, Lynn's always
been that little bit different from us

00:16:57.207 --> 00:17:00.323
She's always been more serious
as far as studies are concerned

00:17:00.768 --> 00:17:04.158
I didn't feel like going to a
grammar school, I just er...

00:17:04.159 --> 00:17:07.665
you know, comprehensive school
it just seemed more friendly

00:17:07.666 --> 00:17:11.327
At that time that is, but
now a little bit different

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:14.582
- Grammar school's fantastic
- If you say so!

00:17:15.187 --> 00:17:16.892
When I leave this school

00:17:17.084 --> 00:17:21.004
I'm down for Heathfield
and Fairfield Manor

00:17:21.443 --> 00:17:27.171
and then maybe I may want to go to
university but I don't know which one yet

00:17:32.466 --> 00:17:33.951
This is Susie

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:37.349
the product of a private
education and wealthy parents

00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:46.927
What do you think about
making this program?

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.700
I just think it's ridiculous, I
don't see any point in doing it

00:17:54.581 --> 00:17:55.957
Why not?

00:17:56.827 --> 00:18:00.317
What's the point of people going
into peoples lives and saying:

00:18:00.318 --> 00:18:03.357
"Why do you like this and why
don't you?" I don't see any point in it

00:18:03.358 --> 00:18:06.927
Well I didn't want to
do it when I was fourteen

00:18:07.341 --> 00:18:10.726
I know I was very difficult
because I was very anti doing it

00:18:10.727 --> 00:18:13.909
because I was pressurised
into doing it by my parents

00:18:16.093 --> 00:18:17.933
and I hated it

00:18:17.934 --> 00:18:21.073
and I vowed I'd never do it now

00:18:21.074 --> 00:18:22.821
but here I am

00:18:23.261 --> 00:18:25.453
I'd like to do...

00:18:25.454 --> 00:18:28.173
short hand typing
or something like that

00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:30.761
I left school when I was
sixteen, went to Paris

00:18:33.252 --> 00:18:36.067
went to secretarial
college and got a job

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:39.777
What made you decide to
leave school and go to Paris?

00:18:40.897 --> 00:18:44.459
I just wasn't interested in school
and just wanted to get away

00:18:46.316 --> 00:18:48.379
and why did you choose Paris?

00:18:49.932 --> 00:18:52.393
I don't know, it was
my parents really

00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:59.157
Did you sort of feel the
need to get away? and why?

00:19:00.653 --> 00:19:03.095
Well I'd lived in
London or Scotland

00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:06.607
and I knew people who were going out
to Paris and so I thought I'd go as well

00:19:06.608 --> 00:19:09.088
Comparing yourselves to Susie

00:19:09.089 --> 00:19:11.275
who stands at the other
end of the social scale

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:13.651
do you think you've had the
same opportunities as her?

00:19:15.064 --> 00:19:18.049
I've had the opportunities
in life that I've wanted

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.973
I'd say I've had more
opportunities than Susie

00:19:22.255 --> 00:19:24.744
I'd say I've had more
opportunities than her

00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:27.167
in a different aspect to
what she's had them

00:19:28.005 --> 00:19:33.510
But eh, my life,  I've been able to
do more or less what I wanted to do

00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:37.349
I'm not going to say it on
film, what i feel for her

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:43.229
But I think she's been so conditioned into
what she should do and what she shouldn't do

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.811
Yeah but I mean

00:19:44.812 --> 00:19:48.646
The whole thing is you're saying
"do we envy anything Susie's had?"

00:19:48.647 --> 00:19:49.347
No

00:19:49.348 --> 00:19:50.705
I mean I don't know

00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:54.023
I don't know what Susie's had,
what's Susie had that I haven't had?

00:19:54.491 --> 00:19:57.878
I mean, until I know that I can't
honestly say whether I envy her

00:19:57.879 --> 00:20:01.161
- She's had money and she's travelled
- I've got money!

00:20:01.162 --> 00:20:03.538
Maybe not enough but I've got it!

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:07.566
I have been to Honolulu with
my father about two years ago

00:20:07.983 --> 00:20:09.871
for a couple of months

00:20:11.635 --> 00:20:14.710
which I didn't really enjoy

00:20:14.711 --> 00:20:19.079
there's nothing much out there, there's
no meet people my own age out there

00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:22.624
and I hated it and I
was glad to come home

00:20:25.236 --> 00:20:29.291
apart from that I've
been to France on holidays

00:20:29.292 --> 00:20:32.405
I'm going to Australia
in the summer

00:20:33.706 --> 00:20:35.412
for about two months

00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:39.268
otherwise I don't know where I'm
going to go and I'd like to go and travel more

00:20:40.798 --> 00:20:42.146
Why?

00:20:42.402 --> 00:20:45.315
Well I don't think there's any
point in sitting in your own country

00:20:45.316 --> 00:20:48.959
I'd like to see how people live
on the other side of the world

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:52.929
Tell me about the
Australian trip

00:20:54.264 --> 00:20:58.181
Well I'm going in July for about
two months with my cousin

00:20:58.459 --> 00:21:00.966
her elder sister's
married out there

00:21:01.236 --> 00:21:04.980
and we're just going out to....

00:21:04.981 --> 00:21:07.354
see what it's like

00:21:07.372 --> 00:21:10.775
we're going to not work out there,
we're only going for two months

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.278
We just feel if we don't
go now we never will

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:19.954
We've got the opportunity and
the time to go now so we're going

00:21:20.357 --> 00:21:21.829
How are you going
to pay for it?

00:21:23.083 --> 00:21:24.907
Save up and go

00:21:25.803 --> 00:21:28.274
Do you get depressed
by money problems?

00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:31.640
No, why?
Why should you?

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.395
- If you can manage on what you've got
- I refuse to get depressed over money

00:21:34.396 --> 00:21:37.542
- It's so easy to but why should you?
- I do, I do

00:21:37.543 --> 00:21:38.925
Why worry about it?

00:21:38.926 --> 00:21:41.506
When I reach the 18th day of the month
and my mortgage is due on the 20th

00:21:41.507 --> 00:21:45.534
and there's nowhere near enough money
in there, I get depressed about it obviously

00:21:45.968 --> 00:21:48.288
Suddenly thinking, oh my god what's
going to happen, you know

00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:51.228
But it gets there, don't
ask me how but you get it

00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:54.059
Do you think you've
settled down to young?

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.653
No

00:21:54.654 --> 00:21:58.251
I've married and we do
things together, or...

00:21:58.864 --> 00:22:02.640
I go out on my own sometimes
with friends from work

00:22:02.641 --> 00:22:06.603
he does the same, what do
you mean by settled down?

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.552
If you think that getting married
as far as we're concerned is a case of

00:22:11.553 --> 00:22:15.490
going to work, come home, cook tea for hubby,
going to bed, getting up, going to work

00:22:15.491 --> 00:22:17.313
you're totally mistaken

00:22:17.314 --> 00:22:20.260
Did you meet enough men
before you decided who to marry?

00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:22.349
I've been married
a year and...

00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:24.374
a couple of months

00:22:25.369 --> 00:22:27.983
you do think "christ,
what have I done?"

00:22:29.757 --> 00:22:33.237
- See I've still got my ideals
- and I'm being honest about it!

00:22:33.582 --> 00:22:38.596
and my husband thinks the same, at
times you think "christ, what have I done?"

00:22:39.453 --> 00:22:40.855
- But then if...
- But marriage...

00:22:40.856 --> 00:22:42.152
Marriage means a
different thing to me

00:22:42.153 --> 00:22:45.799
I've still got my ideals about marriage, I
don't know what it's all about, obviously

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.894
So I've still got pictures of

00:22:47.895 --> 00:22:50.262
- Cosy evenings indoors...yeah
- With roses!

00:22:50.263 --> 00:22:53.309
She'd have cosy evenings
indoors with the central heating!

00:22:54.066 --> 00:22:55.329
Or lack of it!

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.922
- Yeah, I've got a lot to learn
about .... getting married

00:22:57.923 --> 00:23:02.101
I mean, your parents split up
soon after you were fourteen

00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:06.285
What sort of influence,
effect did that have on you?

00:23:08.167 --> 00:23:12.370
Well I was the only child going through
their parents splitting up aged 14

00:23:12.371 --> 00:23:16.571
at a very vulnerable age
and it does touch you up, but...

00:23:17.575 --> 00:23:19.334
You know, you get over it

00:23:20.526 --> 00:23:23.007
There was no point in
them staying together for me

00:23:23.008 --> 00:23:25.403
if it was worse,
I mean the rows and...

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:27.473
and it's worse

00:23:27.474 --> 00:23:30.457
so if two people can't live together
there's no point in making yourself

00:23:30.458 --> 00:23:32.684
even for the sake of children

00:23:34.692 --> 00:23:38.852
What is your attitude towards
marriage? for yourself?

00:23:42.992 --> 00:23:46.915
Well I don't know, I haven't given it a
lot of thought as I'm very cynical about it

00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:53.430
But then you get a certain
amount of faith restored in it

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:57.769
I mean I've got friends and their
parents are happily married

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:02.035
and it does put faith back into you
but me myself I'm very cynical about it

00:24:02.475 --> 00:24:03.674
Why?

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:07.991
Because I think it kills
whatever love is

00:24:09.043 --> 00:24:11.538
it just seems to go wrong

00:24:11.902 --> 00:24:13.985
What do you base that on?

00:24:15.536 --> 00:24:19.708
Well, people I've seen,
people around me

00:24:19.709 --> 00:24:23.953
I mean I've got....not a lot of
my friends are married

00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:32.353
a lot of people who are 20,30 all seem to
be getting divorced and can't stay together

00:24:33.292 --> 00:24:36.584
and at the moment I just
don't really believe in it

00:24:37.068 --> 00:24:39.712
Why do you think people
can't hold marriages together?

00:24:41.616 --> 00:24:44.166
I don't know, I
really don't know

00:24:44.167 --> 00:24:47.753
I don't sort of sit down and
think "ooh ...analyse marriage"

00:24:47.754 --> 00:24:52.216
It's not something I've had to think
about whether I was going to get married

00:24:52.217 --> 00:24:57.201
and I've got no desire to at the
moment, I think twenty is far too young

00:24:57.942 --> 00:24:59.259
What was the wedding like?

00:24:59.627 --> 00:25:02.498
Our wedding?
a laugh!

00:25:07.062 --> 00:25:10.569
I wanted, white
wedding, all trimmings

00:25:12.586 --> 00:25:16.337
My husband would've been
satisfied with very little

00:25:16.338 --> 00:25:19.797
but being as we were
going into it as a full thing

00:25:19.798 --> 00:25:21.441
we went into it

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.492
I had an all white
wedding, all white

00:25:24.493 --> 00:25:27.539
We were both in white and
my bridesmaid was in white

00:25:29.353 --> 00:25:31.533
It's a funny day actually

00:25:32.943 --> 00:25:36.613
because I suppose I was up somewhere
around the five o'clock mark

00:25:37.054 --> 00:25:39.277
and I spent all day preparing

00:25:39.278 --> 00:25:41.803
well all morning I should say

00:25:41.804 --> 00:25:44.422
and then sitting around
for about three hours

00:25:44.423 --> 00:25:48.263
just waiting for something to happen
then when it did happen I don't remember it

00:25:48.264 --> 00:25:49.292
So

00:25:49.293 --> 00:25:51.927
it was just complete
confusion really

00:25:52.639 --> 00:25:54.731
- It was a nice day though
- Oh yeah

00:25:54.732 --> 00:25:58.209
It was funny actually, you can
imagine some of the comments

00:25:59.689 --> 00:26:04.514
I was pleased I was there, it
seemed the right place to be

00:26:04.515 --> 00:26:07.932
I mean I was glad I was at her
wedding, I've known her a long while

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.314
Did anything happen?
Anything funny?

00:26:12.785 --> 00:26:15.433
I can’t forget the cake

00:26:16.321 --> 00:26:20.900
It was horrific really, the cake
what happened to the wedding cake

00:26:21.147 --> 00:26:24.987
it was sitting right
in between Mick and myself

00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:29.955
suddenly the columns just completely
gave way and it just all fell into one

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.329
- It was a nice cake though!
- Yeah it wasn't bad!

00:26:33.982 --> 00:26:36.519
I read the Financial Times

00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:39.691
I read the Observer and the Times

00:26:39.692 --> 00:26:41.531
What do you like about it?

00:26:41.532 --> 00:26:43.229
Well I like...

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.655
I usually look at the headlines
then read about them

00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:49.740
about it

00:26:50.355 --> 00:26:54.261
I like my newspaper because
I've got shares in it

00:26:54.262 --> 00:26:59.154
- and I know every day what the shares are
- The stuff that misers like you like!

00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:03.604
But on Monday's they don't
move up so I don't look at it

00:27:03.605 --> 00:27:07.522
That's one of the troubles with this sort of
program, I don't really think that people like us

00:27:08.487 --> 00:27:11.537
Unless we're seven and being rather
funny, have very much to say that's...

00:27:11.843 --> 00:27:14.051
very interesting,
because I mean...

00:27:14.393 --> 00:27:15.961
we don’t know very much

00:27:16.215 --> 00:27:18.400
Well we didn't know very
much when we were seven

00:27:18.401 --> 00:27:19.918
- But we were still quite funny
- We were at least funny!

00:27:19.919 --> 00:27:21.891
- Yes! - Yes!
- In ourselves!

00:27:21.892 --> 00:27:24.724
I agree with John, all we
can say is what we think

00:27:24.725 --> 00:27:26.670
and if that's of interest to
people, good luck to them

00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:29.678
Yes and I can't believe it is

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:31.221
More fool them!

00:27:31.222 --> 00:27:36.377
When I leave this school
I'm going to College Court

00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:43.643
then I would be going to Westminster
Boarding School if I pass the exam

00:27:44.672 --> 00:27:47.627
and then we think I'm going to

00:27:47.828 --> 00:27:50.091
Cambridge and Trinity Hall

00:27:50.459 --> 00:27:54.004
John is in his final year at
Christchurch Oxford, reading Law

00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:58.039
I do believe parents have a right to
educate their children as they think fit

00:27:59.087 --> 00:28:05.312
I think someone who works on an assembly
line in a car factory, earning a huge wage

00:28:05.313 --> 00:28:08.789
could well afford to send their children
to private school if they wanted to

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.277
Just because..

00:28:11.278 --> 00:28:15.290
some sort of people perhaps don't
put that as high on their priorities as...

00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:17.801
having a smart car or something

00:28:17.802 --> 00:28:22.233
I don't think that's any reason
for abolishing public school

00:28:22.234 --> 00:28:26.216
I think an awful lot more people
could afford to send their sons to school

00:28:26.217 --> 00:28:28.525
You know, to fee paying school

00:28:28.526 --> 00:28:32.238
But they don't choose to,
and that's their choice

00:28:32.556 --> 00:28:35.243
I'm going to Charterhouse

00:28:35.529 --> 00:28:40.872
and after that,
Trinity Hall Cambridge

00:28:40.873 --> 00:28:44.227
Andrew is in his last year at Trinity
College Cambridge, reading Law

00:28:44.228 --> 00:28:49.428
I think if people earn their money
they should have a right to spend it

00:28:49.429 --> 00:28:52.138
an education is very important

00:28:52.139 --> 00:28:57.859
and you can never be sure of leaving
your children any worldly goods but

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.240
at least you can be sure that once
you've given them a good education

00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:03.725
that's something that
no one can take away

00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:05.969
What about university Charlie?

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.331
I might go to Oxford

00:29:08.754 --> 00:29:12.326
You're reading history at Durham
University, you didn't make Oxford

00:29:12.327 --> 00:29:14.267
What are your feelings about that?

00:29:14.268 --> 00:29:16.087
I don't mind at all

00:29:16.498 --> 00:29:18.225
In fact

00:29:19.907 --> 00:29:22.059
I'd say I'm pleased I didn't

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.336
because it was very much a sort of

00:29:26.482 --> 00:29:30.333
sort of set of
Marlborough Prep School

00:29:30.334 --> 00:29:34.635
Marlborough, Oxbridge,
conveyor belt

00:29:34.636 --> 00:29:37.295
you get shoved out at the end

00:29:37.296 --> 00:29:38.853
and you...

00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:43.137
when you go to Oxbridge and it's
obviously not true in all cases but

00:29:43.138 --> 00:29:44.691
I think for the majority

00:29:44.692 --> 00:29:48.949
they mix with the same people
they were at school with

00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.871
So what attracts you to Oxford?

00:29:51.872 --> 00:29:54.725
Well first of all it's such
a beautiful place

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:58.080
there's more to it than just
studying away at one's books

00:29:58.381 --> 00:30:00.741
I think it's very difficult
not to get something out of it

00:30:00.742 --> 00:30:02.395
there’s such a sort of...

00:30:02.396 --> 00:30:05.471
atmosphere of culture and...

00:30:05.915 --> 00:30:10.969
and timelessness about the place that
I think you do sort of mature an awful lot

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:14.881
So what is Beagling?

00:30:14.882 --> 00:30:18.707
Beagling is the
hunting of the hare

00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:21.248
with a pack of hounds,
done on foot

00:30:21.503 --> 00:30:24.347
I mean a lot of people
seem to imagine

00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:28.063
a days hunting with either
fox to hunt or beagles

00:30:29.155 --> 00:30:32.741
unadulterated butchery.
I mean this just isn't true, I think

00:30:32.742 --> 00:30:35.607
I wish people had a more
realistic idea of what it's about

00:30:40.503 --> 00:30:42.815
The hounds are over there I think

00:30:43.531 --> 00:30:46.407
I saw them last streaming
along that hedge there

00:30:53.265 --> 00:30:55.202
- Frustrating isn't it?
- Yes

00:30:59.995 --> 00:31:02.765
I'm reasonably old fashioned about
some things but I mean

00:31:02.766 --> 00:31:06.557
I mean people who go on a lot about the
permissive society are missing the point

00:31:06.558 --> 00:31:10.047
if they think the only
thing that's wrong is sex

00:31:10.048 --> 00:31:16.139
I think you know, decreasing
respect for the family as a unit

00:31:17.827 --> 00:31:21.905
increasing dishonesty,
both in business....

00:31:21.906 --> 00:31:26.869
there used to be much more much stronger
developed ideas of commercial integrity

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:31.644
than seem to be going around nowadays,
nowadays people seem to be out for themselves

00:31:34.672 --> 00:31:39.343
I really do think I suppose there is
an invasion by the American way of life

00:31:39.579 --> 00:31:43.055
which I think is a very sad thing

00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:46.976
Is that unstoppable?
That trend do you think?

00:31:47.429 --> 00:31:49.909
I think it really is
unfortunately, yes

00:31:52.027 --> 00:31:54.411
So where does that
leave your values?

00:31:55.959 --> 00:31:58.291
Well it leaves them with me

00:31:58.527 --> 00:32:04.571
and my future children whom
I shall implicate them in

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:08.965
But do you not find
yourself isolated?

00:32:08.966 --> 00:32:10.365
That really doesn't matter

00:32:10.366 --> 00:32:14.143
If I believe my
principals are right

00:32:14.144 --> 00:32:16.719
and I'm doing the right thing
to bring my children up by them

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.711
it won't matter to me whether
I'm living in the middle-ages mentally

00:32:20.712 --> 00:32:22.919
I shall do what's right

00:32:24.351 --> 00:32:27.765
Well when I was very small my
father always used to go ski-ing

00:32:27.967 --> 00:32:29.887
and he took me with him

00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:32.561
and we've been ever since really

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.017
and how old or young were
you when you started?

00:32:35.238 --> 00:32:38.513
Oh about five, on tiny little ski's

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.478
it was quite frightening then

00:32:41.479 --> 00:32:42.919
what is the appeal of it?

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.725
Well the sort of freedom and
going in the snow and the mountains

00:32:48.129 --> 00:32:50.435
and the feeling of speed

00:32:50.436 --> 00:32:53.027
and getting away
from people if you can

00:32:53.337 --> 00:32:55.575
Do you save up to
come ski-ing or...?

00:32:55.576 --> 00:32:57.688
I don't but my father does

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.357
as he pays for me

00:33:00.621 --> 00:33:04.981
Your parents have been
divorced since fourteen

00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:07.784
- Since you were fourteen
- That's right, quite recently yes

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:10.273
Tell me about that and
the influence it's had on you

00:33:10.717 --> 00:33:12.767
Well not much
influence in fact

00:33:12.818 --> 00:33:15.517
because it's happened
when I'm quite old

00:33:15.518 --> 00:33:17.974
and I'm away from
home a lot anyway

00:33:17.975 --> 00:33:21.087
it's very sad of course

00:33:21.088 --> 00:33:23.561
but I don't think it has had
a great deal of influence

00:33:23.562 --> 00:33:26.588
if it had happened
when I was much younger

00:33:26.589 --> 00:33:28.727
it would've had much
more influence

00:33:28.728 --> 00:33:31.357
an adverse influence
I would've thought

00:33:31.358 --> 00:33:36.088
Did your parents divorce
leave any lasting mark on you?

00:33:36.892 --> 00:33:38.248
I don't know, I mean

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:40.452
seen the film at fourteen so

00:33:41.282 --> 00:33:45.857
and that's of our closest time,
I would've thought it did but...

00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:48.115
don't talk about that anyway so...

00:33:48.116 --> 00:33:49.071
Why?

00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:52.591
I think it's unfair on them

00:33:55.461 --> 00:33:58.579
Very few parents I think,
bring up their children...

00:33:59.467 --> 00:34:04.115
with the intention of belittling them
or doing as little for them as possible

00:34:04.116 --> 00:34:04.953
I think

00:34:04.988 --> 00:34:07.659
you have to assume that most
parents do as much as they can

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.150
given the circumstances
of the children

00:34:10.537 --> 00:34:13.239
and obviously things
could've been far worse

00:34:14.217 --> 00:34:18.216
Do you think it's changed your
attitude to marriage? or...

00:34:18.217 --> 00:34:20.645
It just means that

00:34:20.646 --> 00:34:24.410
because I was faced with that situation I
have an attitude which is a positive attitude

00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:28.106
rather than "well everybody else gets
married therefore I shall get married"

00:34:32.684 --> 00:34:37.372
My attitude would be that if
one is going to have children

00:34:37.373 --> 00:34:42.590
if you want to have children then
that's a very real reason for getting married

00:34:42.591 --> 00:34:44.509
but if you get married...

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.634
it's an agreement to make the
thing work for eighteen years

00:34:47.635 --> 00:34:51.056
or however long it is until
the children have grown up

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.829
no there's no point in just
sitting it out for eighteen years

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.308
there's nothing worse than that, it would
be better for the parents to get a divorce

00:35:00.309 --> 00:35:02.236
I think people

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.156
perhaps don't make
as much effort

00:35:06.157 --> 00:35:09.112
as they should have, or should
do to make marriages work

00:35:09.113 --> 00:35:12.366
it's very easy for me to say so as
I've never been in the position

00:35:12.664 --> 00:35:15.691
In what way should
people make more effort?

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.526
I think people just take too much
for granted when they get married

00:35:21.527 --> 00:35:23.652
or used to, not now perhaps

00:35:23.653 --> 00:35:26.094
I mean, I don't know
about you for instance

00:35:26.095 --> 00:35:29.848
I know my mother,
she's said that

00:35:29.849 --> 00:35:32.300
she's spoilt really

00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:36.019
and she never realised how lucky
she'd been until she'd been divorced

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.018
Up to about twelve

00:35:38.808 --> 00:35:40.598
maybe it's different with
other people, but

00:35:40.599 --> 00:35:44.476
I found that you're much
more attached to your parents

00:35:44.477 --> 00:35:47.601
once you come to about
thirteen, fourteen

00:35:48.605 --> 00:35:50.875
you're not quite so
attached to them

00:35:50.876 --> 00:35:54.863
I think the system of
having house captains

00:35:54.864 --> 00:35:55.981
is rather good

00:35:55.982 --> 00:35:58.430
because when somebody is naughty

00:35:58.431 --> 00:36:02.494
the house captain asks him and...

00:36:03.484 --> 00:36:05.677
and has a talk to him

00:36:05.678 --> 00:36:09.544
once I had a talk to Grevil,
he was in my house

00:36:10.587 --> 00:36:11.787
and

00:36:12.078 --> 00:36:18.619
I asked Sir if he could put him out of my
house because he was always getting minuses

00:36:18.963 --> 00:36:20.564
What did Sir say?

00:36:20.565 --> 00:36:24.392
Sir said that he would...

00:36:24.393 --> 00:36:26.544
we would see
about it this term

00:36:26.545 --> 00:36:29.669
Well I think it's a
very good system

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.480
Have you had to speak to anyone?

00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:35.354
- Just because you are one I suppose?
- No, no I haven't!

00:36:35.355 --> 00:36:37.219
- You're not are you?
- But I am!

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.546
Straw, Mac and Nessie got
three minuses in a day

00:36:43.013 --> 00:36:46.088
If I work in Law I should like
a reasonable amount of success

00:36:46.089 --> 00:36:49.030
I shouldn't like to be on the
bread-line which is all to common

00:36:49.031 --> 00:36:51.351
I'd like to be a Solicitor

00:36:51.352 --> 00:36:53.599
and, also fairly successful

00:36:53.827 --> 00:36:55.493
I only know what I
don't want and that's

00:36:55.494 --> 00:36:59.247
a nuclear family in a
semi-detached in Brentford

00:36:59.248 --> 00:37:00.921
Do you three see yourselves...

00:37:00.922 --> 00:37:04.375
staying in England, living in England,
making your careers in England?

00:37:05.213 --> 00:37:06.313
Yes

00:37:06.669 --> 00:37:09.789
Well the trouble is Law
is not really very exportable

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.455
From my point of view anyway

00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:13.656
I quite like England

00:37:13.657 --> 00:37:17.798
'cause I can't say I really approve very
much of the sort people who emigrate

00:37:18.017 --> 00:37:19.932
I mean it's too
easy for people who...

00:37:19.933 --> 00:37:23.917
this is where I would agree with you
about people who have had opportunities

00:37:23.918 --> 00:37:27.670
I do think they've got a corresponding
duty to sort of put back....

00:37:27.671 --> 00:37:31.667
you know, people who have had
things going well for them

00:37:31.668 --> 00:37:36.361
really ought to stay and help the country
out when things aren't going very well

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:39.492
I don't believe in all
this pulling one's money out

00:37:39.493 --> 00:37:42.783
but that's a moral point of view, I do believe
people have the right to live where they like

00:37:42.784 --> 00:37:44.423
and also to move
their assets around

00:37:44.424 --> 00:37:48.508
but on a moral level I do feel very
strongly that people shouldn't quit

00:37:50.053 --> 00:37:52.750
- Is that why you don't want to leave?
- Yes

00:37:53.153 --> 00:37:57.355
and also I can't imagine
anywhere so nice as England

00:37:58.534 --> 00:38:02.530
Probably stay in England for the reasons that
John put forward, I think one has a moral duty

00:38:02.837 --> 00:38:05.004
It sounds terrible
but,  you know...if...

00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:08.682
It's up to one certainly
to make an attempt

00:38:08.683 --> 00:38:13.756
to put something back in to whatever
it is that you're doing in England

00:38:14.072 --> 00:38:17.961
Having used the various facilities that
are put out for you by the state

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:21.325
I think the more you've
had out of the country

00:38:21.815 --> 00:38:23.958
the more privileges
you're born with

00:38:23.959 --> 00:38:26.399
the greater your duty is

00:38:27.968 --> 00:38:31.354
We chose two boys from a
children's home in Middlesex

00:38:31.355 --> 00:38:32.439
Paul

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.095
Say you had a wife

00:38:37.008 --> 00:38:40.243
say you had to eat
what they cooked you

00:38:41.115 --> 00:38:44.315
and say I don't like
vegetables, well I don't

00:38:45.621 --> 00:38:50.468
and say she said "you have
to eat what you get"

00:38:50.504 --> 00:38:56.635
So I don't like vegetables so say she
gives me vegetables then that's it

00:38:56.636 --> 00:38:58.910
Well as far as I know my
mother and father got...

00:38:58.911 --> 00:39:01.373
well they separated
originally I think

00:39:03.097 --> 00:39:04.953
they eventually got divorced

00:39:05.221 --> 00:39:09.119
I went to the boarding school for one
year then we emigrated to Australia

00:39:10.223 --> 00:39:12.451
my father got remarried

00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:16.346
and how do you get on
with your step-mum?

00:39:17.011 --> 00:39:21.043
pretty well but like I said
before I'm just not close enough

00:39:21.044 --> 00:39:23.838
I'm not really close
to my father either

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.168
Paul left the children's home
when he was eight

00:39:27.169 --> 00:39:29.807
Our other boy stayed
until he was thirteen

00:39:29.808 --> 00:39:31.158
Symon

00:39:31.921 --> 00:39:35.200
Was it difficult moving from the
home back to live with your mother?

00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:38.958
- You're still here after, eight years now?
- Yeah yeah

00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:41.757
Well I find it's comfortable

00:39:42.302 --> 00:39:45.755
See I can get on well with
my mother sometimes

00:39:46.834 --> 00:39:49.107
well that's good
because a lot of ...

00:39:49.108 --> 00:39:53.462
young children can't get on with their
parents at all at this time of the year, their life

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.797
but I get on pretty
well with my mum now

00:39:58.315 --> 00:40:00.490
we talk very well with each other

00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:01.744
but it's..

00:40:01.745 --> 00:40:04.618
sometimes not quite
as mother and son

00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:06.477
sort of more like friends

00:40:06.478 --> 00:40:08.771
What sort of life does
your mother have?

00:40:08.772 --> 00:40:12.511
Well it seems hard, I mean
she's always been...

00:40:13.068 --> 00:40:14.569
nervous

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.265
not all the time, but...

00:40:16.266 --> 00:40:20.743
she has periods of depression or deep
depression or whatever you want to call it

00:40:21.603 --> 00:40:24.633
that sort of makes me think
"well what happened there?"

00:40:25.053 --> 00:40:27.449
What effect has that
had on you do you think?

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:31.552
Well it's made me very sort
of protective towards her

00:40:31.553 --> 00:40:34.804
I feel I've got to
help her all the time

00:40:34.805 --> 00:40:37.231
They say "Where's your
father then?"

00:40:37.232 --> 00:40:40.644
You know when your mums out at
work "Where's your father?"

00:40:40.645 --> 00:40:43.464
and I just tell them
I ain't got one

00:40:48.481 --> 00:40:50.907
What effect has that had on you?

00:40:52.206 --> 00:40:55.742
Well I don't think it's had
any effect on me, 'cause...

00:40:57.471 --> 00:41:00.225
what you don't have
you don't miss

00:41:00.226 --> 00:41:02.706
Twenty years ago

00:41:03.843 --> 00:41:05.323
when I was born

00:41:05.779 --> 00:41:07.648
an illegitimate child, you know

00:41:07.649 --> 00:41:10.658
that's something that's
only whispered about

00:41:11.106 --> 00:41:15.226
people feel strongly
about it in those days

00:41:15.227 --> 00:41:18.062
but nowadays it's..

00:41:19.296 --> 00:41:20.588
it's not a serious matter

00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:24.048
the serious point is whether you
stay with someone or you leave them

00:41:24.264 --> 00:41:28.063
We took Paul and Symon round the buildings
which were once the children's home

00:41:28.064 --> 00:41:31.626
I remember this path but I've
never walked on it was out of bounds

00:41:31.627 --> 00:41:34.947
the only place I saw this was
from out the windows and that

00:41:34.948 --> 00:41:37.519
- What was that there?
- That? That was eh...

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.188
That was hospital juniors,
that's where we used to be

00:41:40.189 --> 00:41:41.696
- Really?
- Yeah

00:41:41.697 --> 00:41:44.106
I don’t like the big boys

00:41:44.107 --> 00:41:45.830
Hitting us and...

00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:48.234
and the staff is up
in the washroom

00:41:48.235 --> 00:41:51.431
sends the nurse out,
"well there's no talking"

00:41:51.432 --> 00:41:53.485
"No I wasn't talking today"

00:41:53.486 --> 00:41:56.212
Then Brown sent
me out for nothing

00:42:01.968 --> 00:42:03.470
Remember the tiles?

00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:06.172
- No not really
- Yeah I remember them when they were cleaner

00:42:06.173 --> 00:42:10.142
- I remember the two offices
- Yeah the doctors and the nurses

00:42:10.769 --> 00:42:12.452
Some things gone

00:42:12.453 --> 00:42:14.519
- The seats
- Yeah the seats

00:42:14.812 --> 00:42:17.437
The smell, the smells gone

00:42:18.227 --> 00:42:20.114
- Remember Midgely
- Yeah

00:42:20.115 --> 00:42:22.410
He was a real bastard

00:42:22.411 --> 00:42:25.010
I remember one night,
I forget what I actually did

00:42:25.011 --> 00:42:27.778
But he made me clean
all the shoes in the house

00:42:27.779 --> 00:42:31.057
there was about fifty pair of shoes
and took about two hours or something

00:42:31.508 --> 00:42:37.187
Well I feel like joining in
when there's already a fight

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.728
Ah do you remember Froggy Page?

00:42:39.729 --> 00:42:40.734
No

00:42:41.531 --> 00:42:43.444
He was the tailor

00:42:43.445 --> 00:42:45.190
- I remember him
- Tailor?

00:42:45.191 --> 00:42:47.582
Yeah he was here for thirty-seven
years or something

00:42:47.583 --> 00:42:50.521
bent over backwards or bent
over forwards or something

00:42:51.204 --> 00:42:52.950
- The golf course
- Yeah

00:42:52.951 --> 00:42:56.212
Used to think about running away
over that when you'd get scared

00:42:56.213 --> 00:42:59.971
That's where the headmaster's son used to
shoot the squirrel's off the trees isn't it - yeah

00:42:59.972 --> 00:43:01.784
Do you remember the boy that

00:43:01.785 --> 00:43:04.170
in the senior part

00:43:04.171 --> 00:43:05.817
where my brother was, he

00:43:05.818 --> 00:43:09.619
he was sleeping one time and he
went out the second story window

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.402
Oh the sleep walker,
Weaver, Robert Weaver

00:43:12.403 --> 00:43:14.546
- We all had to pray for him
- Yeah

00:43:15.992 --> 00:43:18.488
- Everybody said he had a steel plate in his head
- Yeah

00:43:18.489 --> 00:43:22.335
How have you got on with Symon? after
you haven't seen him for fourteen years

00:43:23.855 --> 00:43:26.896
Well I didn't recognise him at all

00:43:27.984 --> 00:43:31.520
I think we got along really well, I
don't know what he'd say to that but

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:35.374
I found him very likeable

00:43:37.874 --> 00:43:42.508
He's just the sort of person who
if I could I'd like to do something for them

00:43:42.843 --> 00:43:47.370
Because I feel I've got, no offence to
him, but I feel I've got more than him

00:43:47.371 --> 00:43:49.360
It's just that it
seems to me that

00:43:49.911 --> 00:43:53.127
things have fallen
into line now for me

00:43:53.489 --> 00:43:56.758
Every thing's started to come
good, I've started to enjoy life

00:43:57.826 --> 00:44:01.585
and I've started to think
"well I'm not a no hoper"

00:44:01.586 --> 00:44:05.584
Because I think that's what
I've always thought about myself

00:44:05.585 --> 00:44:08.395
I know I didn't have
any confidence in myself

00:44:08.692 --> 00:44:11.524
despite what I said
when I was fourteen

00:44:11.525 --> 00:44:13.506
I've always lacked confidence

00:44:13.507 --> 00:44:16.312
I still do to a certain
extent but nothing

00:44:16.596 --> 00:44:20.052
nothing like I did say
when I was fourteen

00:44:21.268 --> 00:44:23.922
The job I'm in, I
mean, brick laying

00:44:24.882 --> 00:44:28.032
I mean I enjoy it,
it interests me

00:44:29.138 --> 00:44:31.225
and I'm very
content at work

00:44:33.495 --> 00:44:37.544
in June last year I was
made a junior partner

00:44:38.343 --> 00:44:41.509
though that was
through circumstances

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.881
but I look at it this way

00:44:43.882 --> 00:44:45.829
I'm not great with my life

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:49.034
but if I wasn't good enough and
my boss didn't think I was good enough

00:44:49.035 --> 00:44:51.327
he would've never made
me a junior partner

00:44:51.328 --> 00:44:52.988
as for the job

00:44:52.989 --> 00:44:54.589
you know, you build a house

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.060
then you turn around and look
at it and say "well I did that"

00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:00.005
it's better than having
a whole row of figures

00:45:00.006 --> 00:45:02.323
it's substance you know,
there's something there

00:45:04.517 --> 00:45:08.641
Symon works in the freezer room of a
meat company near his home in Middlesex

00:45:09.939 --> 00:45:12.019
My job’s running away from me

00:45:14.713 --> 00:45:18.679
You do jobs which I suppose
are fairly routine and dull

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.747
- Yeah
- What keeps you going during them?

00:45:22.863 --> 00:45:25.041
Oh it's definitely
the people there

00:45:26.061 --> 00:45:29.428
You work up a kind of team
spirit there, y'know what I mean

00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:31.709
You can .....

00:45:32.989 --> 00:45:35.595
think about all the work
you've got to do in the morning

00:45:35.596 --> 00:45:37.318
and you just don't want to go

00:45:37.319 --> 00:45:40.341
but once you get there
just sort of generally....

00:45:40.342 --> 00:45:42.935
I was going to say messing around
there, I won't say that

00:45:42.936 --> 00:45:44.497
the managers might see it

00:45:44.498 --> 00:45:46.073
sort of joking about

00:45:46.074 --> 00:45:49.433
they make you feel you
want to get the work done

00:45:49.434 --> 00:45:50.605
Go out and get some

00:45:52.001 --> 00:45:53.185
just ask for them

00:45:53.186 --> 00:45:56.575
and we always say

00:45:57.094 --> 00:46:00.197
when we come out of the chiller
we don't want to go back in

00:46:00.198 --> 00:46:03.089
but when we get
back in we get on with it

00:46:05.234 --> 00:46:07.467
So are you a good time keeper?

00:46:07.468 --> 00:46:09.033
Ah it depends

00:46:09.215 --> 00:46:11.065
Usually I try to get
to work early

00:46:11.066 --> 00:46:14.521
but I have periods of
where I just say "sod it"

00:46:15.246 --> 00:46:17.795
if I get there I get there

00:46:18.621 --> 00:46:21.303
I think the hardest thing
is to get up in the morning

00:46:21.304 --> 00:46:23.377
for me it takes a great
deal out of me now

00:46:23.378 --> 00:46:26.673
Do you never feel you should
be doing better jobs than these?

00:46:26.674 --> 00:46:28.714
Aren't you worth more than this?

00:46:32.477 --> 00:46:34.751
No I haven't really

00:46:34.752 --> 00:46:37.229
I suppose I just like hard
work, I don't know

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.835
But eh...

00:46:39.809 --> 00:46:42.855
It's never really
sort of worried me

00:46:42.856 --> 00:46:46.115
I suppose it should
but it just hasn't

00:46:47.211 --> 00:46:49.941
and how do you see the
future as far as work goes?

00:46:53.168 --> 00:46:57.163
Well I know I can't stay at Walls
forever, I mean it's just not me

00:46:57.253 --> 00:47:01.292
I couldn't stay there for that
long, my mind would go dead

00:47:01.859 --> 00:47:03.315
But eh...

00:47:06.295 --> 00:47:10.037
I think if I really wanted to
I could learn a trade, even now

00:47:10.914 --> 00:47:17.281
Y'know if I really felt that I ought
to get out and do something different

00:47:17.282 --> 00:47:19.659
I could learn a
trade if I wanted to

00:47:20.347 --> 00:47:24.053
and what would you like to
be doing say in seven years?

00:47:28.543 --> 00:47:32.032
Well I couldn't really say I haven't
thought one year ahead yet

00:47:33.451 --> 00:47:35.819
I think I'm still sort
of young in my head

00:47:36.118 --> 00:47:38.716
I don't really sort of
take things seriously

00:47:38.717 --> 00:47:40.938
All I want out of
life is to be happy

00:47:40.939 --> 00:47:44.515
and when I say happy I want
to be happily married as well

00:47:44.516 --> 00:47:49.014
because I can't say I
don't want to get married

00:47:49.015 --> 00:47:50.661
because I think I do

00:47:50.662 --> 00:47:52.542
but I want to be
happily married y'know

00:47:52.543 --> 00:47:54.923
therefore I want to
make sure I think

00:47:54.924 --> 00:47:57.691
How would you define
happiness? What is it?

00:48:00.827 --> 00:48:04.026
Basically to me it's
the will to live

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:09.333
I mean, me I literally
love life, I love people

00:48:09.334 --> 00:48:11.581
I mean I think
before I didn't

00:48:11.582 --> 00:48:14.144
I mean, when I
was fourteen I said

00:48:14.427 --> 00:48:16.921
I've forgotten what the
question was but I said

00:48:17.815 --> 00:48:19.496
something about I
want to be alone

00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:23.385
and when I said that I know
even now I meant that

00:48:23.386 --> 00:48:25.861
if someone had dropped
me out in the Sahara Desert

00:48:26.635 --> 00:48:29.627
I probably would've been happy
more or less if you get the point

00:48:30.603 --> 00:48:32.962
Whereas I'm not like that now,
I'd sooner be around people

00:48:32.963 --> 00:48:35.881
I don't like doing
things by myself

00:48:37.719 --> 00:48:43.349
and happiness to me is a love
for life and a love for people

00:48:44.717 --> 00:48:48.291
I think I admire people
with great determination

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:51.435
y'know like people who just
come up from nothing

00:48:51.436 --> 00:48:54.089
they build up their life
from absolutely nothing

00:48:58.651 --> 00:49:00.907
I could say Muhammad Ali

00:49:00.908 --> 00:49:03.747
because he absolutely
came from nothing

00:49:05.129 --> 00:49:09.801
I mean you can't agree with everything
he says but his word goes down now

00:49:09.802 --> 00:49:14.343
he's the biggest thing in sport
he's one of the biggest things in life

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:18.259
I mean people like him

00:49:19.805 --> 00:49:26.776
What when you look at yourself do you
think your weaknesses and strengths are?

00:49:35.836 --> 00:49:39.449
I think my main weakness is
I don't really take a grip of life

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:41.068
I don't really look...

00:49:42.457 --> 00:49:46.945
I always look deeply into
it but it just seems to be ...

00:49:46.946 --> 00:49:51.364
just a sort of hobby with me, I
look at everything and I criticise it

00:49:51.365 --> 00:49:55.673
and I work everything out but
after that I just sort of leave it

00:49:55.674 --> 00:49:58.800
I find it hard to express
emotion most of the time

00:49:58.801 --> 00:50:01.367
although I'm getting
on top of that

00:50:01.368 --> 00:50:03.234
more happy now?

00:50:03.625 --> 00:50:07.928
just the simple things to say to Susan,
y'know "I love you" or something like that

00:50:08.441 --> 00:50:10.712
I mean I can tell
you about it but

00:50:11.487 --> 00:50:15.311
I really haven't been able
to say it freely to Susan

00:50:16.125 --> 00:50:18.557
I suppose that's a weakness

00:50:18.558 --> 00:50:20.053
Do you have a dream?

00:50:21.079 --> 00:50:22.173
A dream? not....

00:50:22.174 --> 00:50:27.747
Not so much a dream but I know
if I ever wanted to get on I could do it

00:50:28.663 --> 00:50:33.977
I mean I always feel that I've got something
inside me that would make me move

00:50:34.353 --> 00:50:36.241
But eh...

00:50:37.341 --> 00:50:40.539
I think what it is really is I'm just
waiting for an excuse to use it

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:45.520
Y'know at the moment I feel
ok just getting on with my life

00:50:46.029 --> 00:50:48.190
just sort of keeping up

00:50:48.479 --> 00:50:51.359
but I know if I really
wanted to I could get on

00:50:52.003 --> 00:50:54.899
It'll only take a little
spark with me to do it

00:50:59.457 --> 00:51:02.572
Is it important to fight? Yes

00:51:13.581 --> 00:51:17.003
Would everybody please sit round
now and get on with their work

00:51:17.004 --> 00:51:19.887
I don't want to see
any backs to me

00:51:20.567 --> 00:51:23.750
Shouldn't be anybody turning
round, Tony do you hear aswell?

00:51:25.443 --> 00:51:27.439
Get on with your work in front

00:51:28.477 --> 00:51:30.027
Tony!

00:51:30.407 --> 00:51:32.040
Don't turn
round again

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.961
I want to be a jockey when I grow up
yeah I want to be a jockey when I grow up

00:51:42.739 --> 00:51:45.989
Tony left his Eastend secondary
modern school at fifteen

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:49.843
and became an apprentice at
Tommy Gosling's racing stables in Epsom

00:51:55.498 --> 00:51:58.525
This is a photo finish of
when I rode at Newberry

00:52:00.587 --> 00:52:02.035
I'm the one with the white cap

00:52:02.036 --> 00:52:05.721
I was beaten a length and a half
for third and had a photo finish

00:52:06.219 --> 00:52:08.881
so I took it out the box and
kept it as a souvenir

00:52:08.882 --> 00:52:10.921
Have you any other pictures
of you as a jockey?

00:52:10.922 --> 00:52:13.479
Yeah I've got a lot of them

00:52:13.921 --> 00:52:15.071
Show me that one

00:52:16.215 --> 00:52:18.919
That one when I was at Windsor

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.100
that was my last ride on the old
horse, Sharrod Heath that was

00:52:22.341 --> 00:52:24.805
he was a lovely old horse,
I'll never forget him

00:52:24.806 --> 00:52:26.405
How many rides did you have?

00:52:26.851 --> 00:52:28.035
Only three

00:52:28.551 --> 00:52:29.885
Why was that?

00:52:30.117 --> 00:52:32.821
Well obviously if I was good
enough I would've had more

00:52:32.822 --> 00:52:36.879
that was the first day I ever
put myself in jockey silks

00:52:37.155 --> 00:52:39.155
that was my first ride ever

00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:40.914
How did it feel like?

00:52:40.915 --> 00:52:44.439
It feel like there's no words
that can explain how it felt

00:52:44.673 --> 00:52:47.338
that one was when I
was going to the parade ring

00:52:48.469 --> 00:52:50.623
They're not very good

00:52:50.624 --> 00:52:53.778
my brother, I mean he's not
no good at taking photos

00:52:53.779 --> 00:52:55.583
He's no Lord Snowdon

00:52:55.584 --> 00:52:57.433
But describe
the feeling, go on

00:52:57.434 --> 00:52:59.399
Describe, well....I mean I..

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.430
Frankie Durr right, he was
told to look after me

00:53:02.431 --> 00:53:05.137
so I went in there I said "I
don't know my first ride"

00:53:05.138 --> 00:53:09.495
and he said "alright don't worry, your
boss has told me to look after you"

00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:10.785
and so

00:53:10.786 --> 00:53:12.891
I was changing into my silks

00:53:12.892 --> 00:53:16.175
and I felt good y'know, I could
see all the faces that I think

00:53:16.176 --> 00:53:19.759
and when I look at the newspaper I
think, Jeff Lewis, Frankie Durr and...

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.288
I thought to myself all of a sudden I'm
in the same room getting changed

00:53:23.289 --> 00:53:24.884
Then I walked in the parade room

00:53:24.885 --> 00:53:26.576
the parade ring and eh...

00:53:26.577 --> 00:53:29.521
and all my family's there and
they're all going "Go on Tone!"

00:53:30.045 --> 00:53:31.676
and the boss came over and he said

00:53:31.677 --> 00:53:34.584
you've got to do this to the horse,
you hold him back, you go half pace

00:53:34.585 --> 00:53:36.865
keep your hands down,
keep him in the rails

00:53:36.866 --> 00:53:38.851
and I'm going "yeah
yeah" like, nod

00:53:38.852 --> 00:53:42.025
and all of a sudden when he
said "Jockeys please mount"

00:53:42.026 --> 00:53:43.723
and the bell went "Ding ding"

00:53:43.724 --> 00:53:46.716
and my heart just sunk
because I thought to myself

00:53:46.717 --> 00:53:49.185
Here I was yesterday
a sort of nobody

00:53:49.186 --> 00:53:52.235
and here I am today, I'm king like

00:53:52.236 --> 00:53:55.047
I felt king for one day,
well for ten minutes

00:53:55.048 --> 00:53:56.727
Do you regret not making it?

00:53:56.899 --> 00:54:00.708
Well I would've given my right
arm at the time to become a jockey

00:54:01.077 --> 00:54:02.863
But now...

00:54:02.864 --> 00:54:06.069
well I wasn't good enough,
it's as easy as that

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.892
What will you do if you
don't make it as a jockey?

00:54:08.893 --> 00:54:10.503
I don't know

00:54:10.504 --> 00:54:13.369
If I knew I couldn't be
one I'd get out of the game

00:54:14.765 --> 00:54:16.373
wouldn't bother

00:54:16.374 --> 00:54:18.555
and what do you think
you would do then?

00:54:19.175 --> 00:54:20.789
Learn taxi's

00:54:21.365 --> 00:54:23.329
Taxi driver

00:54:29.541 --> 00:54:32.317
I will be a cab driver
right, how can I fail?

00:54:32.318 --> 00:54:34.607
I got one brother
taxi driver pulling me

00:54:34.608 --> 00:54:37.791
and the other brother pushing
me so I got to make it

00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:40.518
I will be a cab driver
and I know I will

00:54:40.519 --> 00:54:44.075
and I'm going to prove every person
who thinks I can't be a cab driver wrong

00:54:44.305 --> 00:54:47.872
and I'm going to get that
badge and put it right in their face

00:54:47.873 --> 00:54:51.599
just to tell them how wrong they
can be and how under estimated I am

00:54:52.938 --> 00:54:56.903
Doing the taxi knowledge means Tony
going out on his motorbike every day

00:54:56.904 --> 00:54:59.709
and learning the hundreds of
routes round the streets of London

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:03.143
Well I can just get up, go on my
bike, do two runs, come home

00:55:03.144 --> 00:55:08.585
call them over then boom, I've done my days
work then I go
out here and earn my money

00:55:09.399 --> 00:55:11.928
Hackney Wick it's
my sort of living

00:55:11.929 --> 00:55:14.433
I can say until the time
I am a cab driver

00:55:14.434 --> 00:55:17.318
But  mean my freedom's here and
that is the main thing what I want

00:55:17.585 --> 00:55:22.145
Tony spends his spare time at Hackney Wick
Greyhound Stadium placing bets for the punters

00:55:22.233 --> 00:55:24.271
Fifty-five to twenty Boris

00:55:35.441 --> 00:55:38.151
Five to one Cooladine

00:55:38.462 --> 00:55:40.105
Four and a half fifty's,
four and a half fifty's

00:55:42.335 --> 00:55:44.579
Poor-Sunshine fourteen to one

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.276
Take it, take it!

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.881
If your father gambles you always
looked upon how he gambles

00:55:49.882 --> 00:55:51.820
I tried my luck and
see what he does

00:55:52.522 --> 00:55:55.017
and I took it from there,
it's sort of in you

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:59.263
some people drink and they can't get out of
drinking, some people smoke and can't stop smoking

00:55:59.264 --> 00:56:02.599
well I think I'm firmly on
the ground as a gambler

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.277
I know you can't win gambling, putting
money on the dogs and horses, I know that

00:56:06.278 --> 00:56:09.893
But when you put other
peoples money on you can't lose

00:56:09.894 --> 00:56:11.384
What do they call you here?

00:56:11.385 --> 00:56:13.966
I reckon a pest, or
something like that

00:56:13.967 --> 00:56:17.735
'cause I'm always running and doing
everything that I shouldn't be doing

00:56:18.403 --> 00:56:21.469
I thought I was going to get
barred one day 'cause I used to...

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:23.666
Well I don't mean to make
a nuisance of myself

00:56:23.667 --> 00:56:27.150
I mean if the other
patrons of the place

00:56:27.151 --> 00:56:29.981
they don't want to see a little
boy nipping between their feet

00:56:29.982 --> 00:56:32.448
running, putting a
bet on for a person

00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:35.073
You understand? they think "cor
what's he doing is he mad?"

00:56:35.074 --> 00:56:38.111
I mean I walk up there
I order the teas

00:56:38.112 --> 00:56:40.455
There could be eight people
in front of me, I just go...

00:56:40.456 --> 00:56:42.581
Can I have a tea please,
tea please, five times

00:56:42.582 --> 00:56:43.751
tea please
tea please

00:56:43.752 --> 00:56:46.759
and they've got to serve me before them
to get rid of me, do you understand?

00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:49.424
So that’s how you've got to do it

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:52.086
Just keep on and on
and on and they go

00:56:52.087 --> 00:56:54.921
"oh driving me mad, here you are,
get rid of him" it's as easy as that

00:56:55.603 --> 00:56:58.784
That's the way to get on in
life, just be a noise, annoyed

00:56:59.145 --> 00:57:03.898
annoyance all the time to a person and they go
"oh he's driving me mad, get him away from me

00:57:03.899 --> 00:57:06.440
and more or less they
give you the first option

00:57:06.441 --> 00:57:08.225
sort of find that

00:57:08.461 --> 00:57:11.885
You're very short, has
that had much trouble?

00:57:11.886 --> 00:57:14.197
Well a bird said
to me the other day

00:57:14.198 --> 00:57:15.777
She said "ain't you small"

00:57:15.778 --> 00:57:18.467
So I said "but you're ugly
at least I can grow"

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:21.707
What can they say to that? they
can't say nothing can they?

00:57:21.708 --> 00:57:23.378
to a thing like that, or...

00:57:23.379 --> 00:57:24.557
or example...

00:57:24.558 --> 00:57:28.099
She said to me "Ain't you small" so I looked
at her tits and she was only about a thirty

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:31.187
I said "But you're not too big
either so we're both in the same way"

00:57:31.493 --> 00:57:33.561
- Have you got a girlfriend?
- No

00:57:33.729 --> 00:57:36.481
Would you like to
have a girlfriend?

00:57:36.482 --> 00:57:37.307
No

00:57:37.308 --> 00:57:39.005
Do you understand "The Four F's?"

00:57:39.006 --> 00:57:41.183
Find the, feed them, forget them

00:57:41.184 --> 00:57:44.244
for the other F I'll let you
use your own discrimination

00:57:44.245 --> 00:57:45.063
I mean...

00:57:45.064 --> 00:57:46.523
this one

00:57:46.524 --> 00:57:48.457
I tried to do the three F's

00:57:48.777 --> 00:57:50.611
but I couldn't forget her

00:57:51.001 --> 00:57:53.567
I'd done the three F's
but I couldn't forget her

00:57:53.568 --> 00:57:55.961
It sounds silly but that's
the only way I can put it

00:57:56.199 --> 00:57:59.091
Tell me about the family,
are you fairly closely knit?

00:57:59.332 --> 00:58:00.853
Well I love them all

00:58:00.854 --> 00:58:04.142
There's not one I don't love more than
the other, other than my mum obviously

00:58:04.143 --> 00:58:08.630
but your mum is the root of the
tree, you love your mum best

00:58:08.631 --> 00:58:11.042
So what do you like about
living in the Eastend?

00:58:11.043 --> 00:58:14.175
It's very sort of real,
there's nothing false

00:58:14.395 --> 00:58:16.267
only the police!

00:58:16.627 --> 00:58:20.735
I'm firmly placed and there's no way I can
see getting out, I wouldn't want to get out really

00:58:20.736 --> 00:58:26.095
It's very hard to make it in the Eastend
because the roots are firmly stuck in the ground

00:58:26.096 --> 00:58:28.345
and you've got to have a
big hard pull to get them out

00:58:28.346 --> 00:58:30.437
So are there many
villains in the Eastend?

00:58:31.209 --> 00:58:33.354
There has been in
the time I suppose

00:58:33.355 --> 00:58:36.063
the originals were
the Kray twins

00:58:36.064 --> 00:58:38.653
We're in Vallance Rd now, as
it goes they used to live here

00:58:38.654 --> 00:58:41.847
in a house they used
to call Fort Vallance

00:58:41.848 --> 00:58:44.291
'cause it was that hard
to get into I expect

00:58:44.547 --> 00:58:46.503
Do you have much
to do with villains?

00:58:46.504 --> 00:58:50.085
I can't say I have much to do,
I wouldn't say I'm a villain myself

00:58:50.086 --> 00:58:53.221
I don't go thieving and don't do
anybody any harm fighting wise

00:58:53.222 --> 00:58:55.023
I'm trying to say that

00:58:55.024 --> 00:59:00.023
Wherever you go there's villains and whether
you mix with them or not it's up to you

00:59:00.167 --> 00:59:03.351
Does it worry you the possibility
of becoming one of them?

00:59:03.352 --> 00:59:05.473
How can I become a villain?

00:59:05.474 --> 00:59:08.375
If it's not in there, it's not born
in there you won't become one

00:59:08.376 --> 00:59:11.329
Don't you think you're going to
regret not having an education?

00:59:11.506 --> 00:59:14.321
Where does that come into it?
it doesn't come into it in my mind?

00:59:14.322 --> 00:59:18.391
Education is just a thing to say
"my son is higher than him"

00:59:18.392 --> 00:59:20.707
or "my son had a better
background than him"

00:59:20.708 --> 00:59:22.247
I mean

00:59:22.248 --> 00:59:25.605
I'm as good or even better
than most of them people

00:59:25.606 --> 00:59:28.011
especially on this program

00:59:28.012 --> 00:59:29.004
I mean

00:59:29.223 --> 00:59:31.016
On one of the trailers
you'll think

00:59:31.017 --> 00:59:33.957
oh the Eastend boy and he
ain't got a no good education

00:59:33.958 --> 00:59:37.811
but all of a sudden the Eastend boy's got a
car and a motorbike and he goes to Spain every year

00:59:37.812 --> 00:59:39.127
and whatever

00:59:39.461 --> 00:59:41.128
and have I worked for it?

00:59:41.129 --> 00:59:42.780
No I'm here putting bets on

00:59:42.781 --> 00:59:44.605
and you think "how
does he do it?"

00:59:44.606 --> 00:59:46.870
and there's a boy,
who's he? and whatever

00:59:46.871 --> 00:59:50.763
he's studying to be a
professor, he's making up things

00:59:50.764 --> 00:59:53.419
They're mainly education, there's
no education in this world

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:55.587
Just one big rat
race and you've got to

00:59:55.588 --> 00:59:58.449
kill your man next to you
to get in front of him

00:59:58.625 --> 01:00:02.065
What do you think about trade
unions and things like that?

01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:04.167
I don’t under know I don't

01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:06.931
I don't know enough to know about
them if you understand me

01:00:07.675 --> 01:00:08.903
I mean

01:00:08.904 --> 01:00:13.207
I'm not a politician so let them worry
about what's coming for the next day

01:00:13.493 --> 01:00:14.809
all I understand is

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:20.544
dogs, prices, girls, knowledge, roads, streets,
squares and mum and dad and love

01:00:20.545 --> 01:00:23.467
that's all I understand that's
all I want to understand

01:00:30.756 --> 01:00:32.087
Here you are

01:00:35.269 --> 01:00:37.003
Come on three chase it

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:39.335
Come on boy

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:41.845
Go on three inside

01:00:44.098 --> 01:00:46.043
Come on three???

01:00:46.668 --> 01:00:48.857
He's checking everywhere....

01:00:48.858 --> 01:00:51.413
Well going to Africa

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:55.817
and try and teach people
who are not civilised

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:59.343
to be more or less good

01:00:59.344 --> 01:01:03.766
No I don't want to be a missionary because
I just can't talk about it to people

01:01:04.442 --> 01:01:09.642
Y'know, I am interested in it myself
but I wouldn't be very good at it at all

01:01:10.448 --> 01:01:12.272
and I wouldn't enjoy it

01:01:13.018 --> 01:01:15.156
Why wouldn’t you be good at it

01:01:16.607 --> 01:01:19.513
Well I'm just not
very good at...

01:01:19.514 --> 01:01:24.658
at standing up in front of people and
making a speech or anything like that

01:01:24.659 --> 01:01:27.301
I'd like to keep it
private, y'know

01:01:27.302 --> 01:01:30.686
Is it possible you might ever
think of going to the church?

01:01:32.672 --> 01:01:35.807
It is possible, I've
never said no definitely

01:01:36.176 --> 01:01:40.019
But I wouldn't be doing it
after I go to university

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:44.407
I mean it's just possible in
ten years time I suppose

01:01:46.224 --> 01:01:48.561
What would draw
you to the church?

01:01:50.996 --> 01:01:55.609
I don't know, it wouldn't be dissatisfaction
with whatever I'm doing at the moment

01:01:56.831 --> 01:01:58.580
In a way

01:01:58.847 --> 01:02:02.226
If whatever I was doing I
was doing very successfully

01:02:03.702 --> 01:02:07.128
then that would be a better reason
for going into the church really

01:02:07.129 --> 01:02:10.691
or at least if I did go into the church
it would meant I was giving something up

01:02:10.692 --> 01:02:12.007
But

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:17.685
I think the wrong reasons are if you
are dissatisfied with what you're doing

01:02:17.686 --> 01:02:22.782
in the general sense
of doing a job badly or

01:02:22.783 --> 01:02:25.177
a failure in some sort of way

01:02:25.734 --> 01:02:30.219
Bruce is in his final year at University
College Oxford, reading mathematics

01:02:31.043 --> 01:02:36.114
and by Eisenstien you can
show that this is irreducible

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.975
then you do a transformation
on this ???? x = to T+2

01:02:41.894 --> 01:02:46.422
which you find is T cubed plus
17 squared plus 14 T plus 7

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:47.936
and

01:02:47.937 --> 01:02:50.582
you observe that
seven which is a prime

01:02:50.826 --> 01:02:53.370
divides the co-efficient
of T squared

01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:56.152
T and the constant,
not T cubed

01:02:56.309 --> 01:03:00.742
and seven squared doesn't
divide the constant term

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.926
so by Eisenstien

01:03:02.927 --> 01:03:04.723
this is irreducible

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:08.751
so therefore two cross, two
by seven is of degree three

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:11.451
and that length
isn't constructable

01:03:12.207 --> 01:03:14.327
from the quarry of
our original theorem

01:03:14.328 --> 01:03:16.270
so therefore the
septagon's not constructable

01:03:16.271 --> 01:03:20.102
Well that's a nice way of doing it,
particularly using Eisenstien down here

01:03:20.103 --> 01:03:23.583
his test is very popular, he
was an interesting mathematician

01:03:23.584 --> 01:03:26.701
What sort of job are
you going to try for?

01:03:28.969 --> 01:03:33.206
Well there was one job, I'd
like to make maps really

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.586
and it's nice sort
of outdoor life

01:03:38.586 --> 01:03:41.394
you go to...I mean
you travel around

01:03:41.395 --> 01:03:42.534
and eh...

01:03:43.003 --> 01:03:45.450
but there are very
few jobs like that going

01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:49.330
I'm sort of qualified, a general maths
or science degree would do

01:03:49.331 --> 01:03:51.504
or geography degree

01:03:51.885 --> 01:03:53.438
But eh...

01:03:56.404 --> 01:03:59.787
I think I've probably
missed it this time round

01:04:00.032 --> 01:04:01.932
and eh....but that's only....

01:04:01.933 --> 01:04:05.190
perhaps I won't like making maps,
it's something that I think I would do

01:04:14.892 --> 01:04:18.840
Millbrook probably had a
great influence on me in a way

01:04:18.841 --> 01:04:22.165
I mean I was absolutely shocked
rigid when I went to my prep school

01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:24.972
and found people who
thought of doing things wrong

01:04:24.973 --> 01:04:28.709
I never really upset anyone
or questioned authority

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:32.461
or misbehaved in any
of my two later schools

01:04:32.462 --> 01:04:39.266
which may seem an ideal thing but it's probably
healthy to question why you have to do certain things

01:04:39.611 --> 01:04:41.323
which I never did

01:04:41.324 --> 01:04:45.376
Bruce was a border at this pre-preparatory
school from the age of five

01:04:46.763 --> 01:04:48.935
Squad left foot in one place

01:04:50.858 --> 01:04:52.455
squad breathe in

01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:55.798
Well it is mainly this
lack of responsibility

01:04:55.799 --> 01:04:57.397
for doing jobs given to me

01:04:57.398 --> 01:05:00.622
people will say "why haven't you
done this? Look you've upset us"

01:05:00.623 --> 01:05:06.549
I was secretary of bridge society,
chess society, cricket society

01:05:07.005 --> 01:05:09.149
Scottish dancing society

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:12.484
and I didn't do anything for any
of them, they were all very angry

01:05:13.227 --> 01:05:17.456
and I spent last summer
term in total seclusion

01:05:17.457 --> 01:05:19.968
I saw maybe half a
dozen people all term

01:05:19.969 --> 01:05:22.014
in my room, darting
across courts

01:05:22.712 --> 01:05:26.742
people would say "I saw Balden
today" and they'd say "No? really?"

01:05:27.938 --> 01:05:29.562
it was awful really

01:05:29.563 --> 01:05:34.964
My hearts desire is to see my
daddy who is six thousand miles away

01:05:35.373 --> 01:05:38.941
Y'know I've been getting
on well with my step-father

01:05:39.512 --> 01:05:42.263
and I like seeing my
father occasionally

01:05:42.523 --> 01:05:45.034
and he does come
over from Rhodesia

01:05:45.035 --> 01:05:51.187
What effect has the fact that you've
seen very little of your father had on you?

01:05:52.094 --> 01:05:55.159
Nothing really, I only
...something I regret that...

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.646
I didn't really get to
know him better at all

01:06:00.766 --> 01:06:04.335
We've written and we're both very
bad writers, I'm probably worse than him

01:06:05.308 --> 01:06:06.368
and eh...

01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:10.948
that's something I regret is not
having a just a regular correspondence

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:14.929
because I think he's an
interesting man actually

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:17.994
and eh...

01:06:18.744 --> 01:06:20.656
he probably regrets it as well

01:06:20.657 --> 01:06:23.036
What do you think about
your own upbringing?

01:06:23.037 --> 01:06:26.308
what have been the strongest
influences on that?

01:06:27.656 --> 01:06:31.920
Probably to not let
down my mother really

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:35.940
because she's worked awfully
hard to get me through school

01:06:36.728 --> 01:06:37.610
and

01:06:38.206 --> 01:06:40.319
I haven't let
her down yet

01:06:43.576 --> 01:06:44.620
then..

01:06:44.621 --> 01:06:48.544
as far as...eh
...not having...

01:06:48.967 --> 01:06:51.515
my mothers divorce

01:06:51.516 --> 01:06:55.280
I don't think that really has the
effect that people imagine it to have

01:06:55.702 --> 01:06:59.708
I mean I always have got
on well with my stepfather

01:07:00.398 --> 01:07:05.642
and with my half-sister, so in
that sense I've had a family life

01:07:06.006 --> 01:07:08.801
I'd help people
if I had a chance

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:16.086
Y'know by say giving a little bit of
money to charity or sponsoring things

01:07:16.087 --> 01:07:17.740
or things like that

01:07:17.741 --> 01:07:21.308
Well I took nine months off

01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:23.587
between school and university

01:07:25.188 --> 01:07:29.879
and there I taught at a school and
worked in the Banbury sewage works

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:33.717
two months

01:07:34.104 --> 01:07:35.928
What sort of school was it?

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:39.812
Well I never like admitting this
but it was a handicapped school

01:07:39.813 --> 01:07:42.421
I mean

01:07:42.422 --> 01:07:46.187
it seems to present me as
wanting to do these things

01:07:46.188 --> 01:07:47.922
I suppose in a way I do, and

01:07:47.923 --> 01:07:51.736
I do get some satisfaction
from doing it, but....

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:55.226
I could so easily have
done something else

01:07:55.227 --> 01:08:00.384
it was just almost an accident that
I ended up at the spastic school

01:08:01.271 --> 01:08:02.720
and eh...

01:08:02.721 --> 01:08:04.759
I'm glad I did it
because I enjoyed it

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.021
not for its....

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:11.662
I suppose slightly charitable
nature of the work, but

01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:16.382
the people I met, work,
it was quite good

01:08:16.383 --> 01:08:20.370
Why are you frightened of
presenting this image of yourself

01:08:25.297 --> 01:08:27.353
It's...

01:08:28.827 --> 01:08:31.588
It’s possibly because I

01:08:32.886 --> 01:08:35.619
I don't know, I never
want to feel to proud really

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.032
I mean it's dangerous for
a start and it's so easy

01:08:43.033 --> 01:08:43.618
and

01:08:45.708 --> 01:08:49.764
it doesn't work in a way because I
can try and pretend to be humble

01:08:49.765 --> 01:08:54.044
that's being proud in
just the same sort of way

01:08:54.607 --> 01:08:57.484
I find it a very difficult
thing to avoid, pride

01:08:57.485 --> 01:08:59.858
Tell me, are you interested
in politics at all?

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:04.628
Not as much as I was

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:10.756
I am about the only
socialist in my village

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:13.283
and I go into the pub

01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:19.959
and sort of expect to stand up
and defend all socialist policies

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.841
sort of, this is
the village socialist

01:09:22.842 --> 01:09:25.375
no, village idiot, sorry

01:09:26.446 --> 01:09:29.519
you agree with all this immigration
so I stand up and defend it

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.143
and it's awfully hard work though
I think I'm going to give that up

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:38.735
So where do you stand
politically now then?

01:09:39.878 --> 01:09:44.137
I'm still socialist but not as
energetically as I was I suppose

01:09:46.759 --> 01:09:49.818
What do you think about the way
England's being run at the moment?

01:09:54.527 --> 01:09:56.222
Well...

01:10:00.081 --> 01:10:02.427
I'm glad the socialist's
are in power because

01:10:02.793 --> 01:10:08.581
This illusive thing called freedom
is sort of rearing its head

01:10:08.582 --> 01:10:11.513
and the conservatives
are pushing it forward

01:10:11.514 --> 01:10:16.373
and I thought this
argument was smashed

01:10:16.374 --> 01:10:19.323
at the early years of this century
but it seems to be coming back

01:10:19.324 --> 01:10:21.885
and it really is exceptionally
dangerous because

01:10:21.886 --> 01:10:24.257
the more you try
and defend freedom

01:10:24.949 --> 01:10:29.189
you allow everybody to do
exactly what they like within limits

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:31.527
then the less you have

01:10:31.763 --> 01:10:36.763
I mean there's no
freedom in living in a slum

01:10:38.174 --> 01:10:40.166
It's alright you can say the
chap can do whatever he wants

01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:42.977
he can get a better job or anything
but that's just not the case

01:10:42.978 --> 01:10:45.376
the more you defend freedom
the less you have it

01:10:45.377 --> 01:10:49.813
Well my girlfriend is in Africa

01:10:49.992 --> 01:10:53.741
and I don't think I'll have
another chance of seeing her again

01:10:53.742 --> 01:10:55.080
Have you got any girlfriends?

01:10:55.081 --> 01:10:57.307
No, not yet

01:10:57.684 --> 01:11:00.820
I'm sure it will come, but not yet

01:11:00.821 --> 01:11:03.137
What is your attitude to sex?

01:11:04.988 --> 01:11:10.521
Well it's not quite, normal
attitude to anti-sex

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:21.877
I mean I as it were
burnt my fingers a little

01:11:24.165 --> 01:11:27.989
I don't feel as though I'm
missing anything now

01:11:29.487 --> 01:11:31.813
I don't feel a need for it

01:11:33.419 --> 01:11:37.516
and I'm quite happy at not
feeling a need for it really

01:11:40.527 --> 01:11:45.211
I mean I do think a lot of people
think too much about it

01:11:46.102 --> 01:11:48.100
What happened
when you burnt your fingers?

01:11:53.793 --> 01:11:56.647
I'd rather not talk
about it really

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.714
well no in fact I don't
really mean that

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:02.451
I don't mean I don't
want to talk about it

01:12:02.452 --> 01:12:05.510
it's just I'd need quite a long
time to think about it really

01:12:06.257 --> 01:12:07.569
Why?

01:12:12.215 --> 01:12:15.872
Well in the end I
decided the eh...

01:12:18.114 --> 01:12:22.649
the effect, the pleasure, or...

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:26.858
just didn't seem
worth it really

01:12:26.859 --> 01:12:29.123
didn't seem worth...

01:12:40.562 --> 01:12:42.258
See I think there's
two different sorts

01:12:42.259 --> 01:12:46.477
there's casual sex then there's
sex in love and marriage

01:12:46.978 --> 01:12:48.590
and

01:12:50.975 --> 01:12:53.149
casual seks is not...

01:12:53.437 --> 01:12:56.219
I don't think it's quite as
widespread as people believed

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.065
because

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:04.347
if both the people treat it as
casual sex then I think it's alright

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.731
but

01:13:08.573 --> 01:13:11.239
if you're sort of looking for

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.861
I don't know this may
seem awfully silly but

01:13:13.862 --> 01:13:17.802
if you're looking for casual sex
but don't want to treat it as such

01:13:17.803 --> 01:13:22.907
then it doesn't seem to be worth
the lies, I don't know the...

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:26.011
the sort of effort

01:13:26.385 --> 01:13:29.285
- Is this what happened to you?
- I suppose in a way yes

01:13:30.437 --> 01:13:31.658
Have you been in love?

01:13:31.659 --> 01:13:33.169
No, no

01:13:34.485 --> 01:13:36.835
and eh...

01:13:37.503 --> 01:13:39.935
I think I'll probably have
to wait for that really

01:13:39.936 --> 01:13:42.110
Play international wrestling

01:13:42.111 --> 01:13:44.529
Yeah that's only at
summertime though

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:46.621
Yeah summer we can
go on the grass

01:13:53.525 --> 01:13:56.598
Neil went to a comprehensive
school in Liverpool

01:13:56.599 --> 01:14:00.966
got four A-levels then walked out
of Aberdeen university after one term

01:14:00.967 --> 01:14:03.927
and is now doing
casual labour in London

01:14:03.928 --> 01:14:08.352
I came to London I think because
I wanted to start a new life really

01:14:08.543 --> 01:14:12.124
I'd left the university
in Aberdeen

01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:14.459
in the end of nineteen
seventy-five

01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:18.522
and I became conscious of the
fact that I was drifting around

01:14:18.745 --> 01:14:24.625
which I suppose I'm still doing here but at
least I took the decision to move myself

01:14:24.984 --> 01:14:30.473
and I think possibly there's more challenge in
London than there ever could be in Aberdeen

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.960
Peter, Neil's school
friend from Liverpool

01:14:33.961 --> 01:14:37.439
is now in his last year at
London university, reading history

01:14:38.017 --> 01:14:41.041
It was obviously a big step

01:14:41.475 --> 01:14:45.285
it was exciting more than anything,
I mean that sounds corny but it was

01:14:45.286 --> 01:14:47.258
Do you remember the
day you left Liverpool?

01:14:47.259 --> 01:14:48.824
Yeah very well

01:14:49.131 --> 01:14:51.931
It was pouring down with
rain, I remember that

01:14:52.021 --> 01:14:55.708
just had the traditional send of from the train
station, my mum and dad were there

01:14:56.423 --> 01:14:59.831
a couple of mates turned up at the
last minute, from the school to see me

01:15:00.857 --> 01:15:03.493
- Catch a girl and kiss a girl
- Yeah

01:15:03.889 --> 01:15:05.289
and what happens then?

01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:08.377
- Well the girls are all screaming
- Yeah

01:15:08.947 --> 01:15:12.582
and then we catch
them we kiss them

01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:15.327
We're interested in
contrast with you and Neil

01:15:15.328 --> 01:15:20.605
were you aware of differences
in home background at the time?

01:15:20.606 --> 01:15:24.739
Oh sure yeah, I mean both Neil's
parents are teachers as you know

01:15:25.439 --> 01:15:28.107
that's got to be a hell of
a difference for a start

01:15:28.461 --> 01:15:31.552
I mean, I'm not knocking them
for a minute, they're very nice people

01:15:31.743 --> 01:15:33.009
but eh...

01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:37.987
there's obviously going to be some sort
of academic type atmosphere in the house

01:15:39.066 --> 01:15:42.427
which I did notice
one or two times

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.924
but I think Neil

01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:49.605
whether by design or just
by the situation he was in

01:15:49.606 --> 01:15:52.023
was obviously going to
be under more pressure

01:15:52.684 --> 01:15:57.835
I came to London and I
contacted an agency for squatters

01:15:58.562 --> 01:16:02.642
and they were able to give
me the address of somebody

01:16:02.643 --> 01:16:07.374
who was able to help people who were
looking for accommodation in the London area

01:16:08.083 --> 01:16:10.952
and by a process of
chasing people around

01:16:10.953 --> 01:16:14.113
I eventually managed to
find this place here

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:20.806
I wouldn't squat in a place which
I knew to be owned by somebody else

01:16:20.807 --> 01:16:24.816
I wouldn't, certainly because
I knew if I had a place of my own

01:16:24.817 --> 01:16:27.167
and found somebody
squatting in it I'd be disgusted

01:16:27.168 --> 01:16:29.435
But this place
was empty

01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:33.485
and I was simply offered a place to
live here and was very grateful for it

01:16:33.747 --> 01:16:36.755
and I think in
questions of squatting

01:16:37.037 --> 01:16:43.020
a bit of humanity is more important that
vain rules about who can live where

01:16:50.969 --> 01:16:53.711
In contrast, Peter lives
in a flat in North London

01:16:53.712 --> 01:16:55.417
sharing with three
other students

01:16:55.418 --> 01:16:58.257
there have been three
guys living here originally

01:16:58.397 --> 01:17:00.045
and one of them left

01:17:00.285 --> 01:17:03.197
to get engaged,
virtually married

01:17:03.515 --> 01:17:06.984
and the flat was meant
for four in the first place

01:17:07.461 --> 01:17:10.461
so Dave and Trev asked Ian
and I if we'd like to move in

01:17:10.462 --> 01:17:13.608
because we did 'cause we'd been
searching for a flat for some months

01:17:14.217 --> 01:17:16.579
so we jumped at the
opportunity really

01:17:18.443 --> 01:17:21.627
I've got my own room, I
can cook whenever I like

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:25.257
I haven't got a landlady to
tell me what time to come in

01:17:25.258 --> 01:17:27.204
I've got my own front door key

01:17:29.609 --> 01:17:32.748
and to tell the truth it's a lot better
than a lot of the accommodation I've had

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:35.583
over the last eighteen
months or so

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.845
it could be a bit warmer,
it's a bit chilly

01:17:38.589 --> 01:17:40.220
but eh...

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:44.605
it's perfectly satisfactory
for the time being

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.767
These are obvious
restrictions, y'know

01:18:00.768 --> 01:18:02.475
not able to cook for yourself

01:18:02.476 --> 01:18:04.291
you've got to think
for yourself a lot more

01:18:04.292 --> 01:18:06.429
but it's eh...

01:18:07.093 --> 01:18:10.532
certainly not as exhausting or
wearing as I thought it would be

01:18:10.533 --> 01:18:11.901
I mean, y'know...

01:18:11.902 --> 01:18:14.314
coming up myself is a
challenge of some sort

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:17.370
we're going to have to split
two sausages into three now

01:18:17.371 --> 01:18:22.553
Well once Caroline Tetford
said she loved me

01:18:24.882 --> 01:18:28.708
and I'm going to marry
her when I grow up

01:18:28.998 --> 01:18:33.082
I hate her, she's always getting
bad tempered and cross with me

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:33.988
- Does she?
- Yeah

01:18:33.989 --> 01:18:37.044
She says "Neil Hughes, move
your desk forward"

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:40.742
and when I put it back she says
"Neil Hughes put your chair forward"

01:18:40.743 --> 01:18:44.347
and she just gets into a
girly mood with me like that

01:18:44.348 --> 01:18:48.942
Tell me about the period in your life when
you went to university and what happened

01:18:48.943 --> 01:18:50.211
It was a very short period

01:18:50.212 --> 01:18:51.151
I was only at university...

01:18:51.152 --> 01:18:55.639
well I was only taking university seriously
for a matter of two or three months

01:18:57.395 --> 01:19:01.509
maybe I went to the wrong university
or maybe university life didn't suit me

01:19:01.890 --> 01:19:02.930
either way

01:19:03.479 --> 01:19:06.619
I felt a very great need
to get out of the system

01:19:08.223 --> 01:19:11.948
Well this is my final year so
I'm not in college that much

01:19:11.949 --> 01:19:13.319
I don't have to be

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:16.427
so what I'm expected
to do is to be ...

01:19:16.695 --> 01:19:19.822
laying out revision
timetables at home and..

01:19:19.823 --> 01:19:21.252
working like a slave

01:19:21.503 --> 01:19:24.197
which I'm not at the
moment, but I will be soon

01:19:24.198 --> 01:19:26.688
I did make an
application to Oxford

01:19:26.689 --> 01:19:28.006
but I didn't get in

01:19:28.007 --> 01:19:28.991
and eh

01:19:28.992 --> 01:19:31.661
well I think that's in the
past now and that's...

01:19:31.662 --> 01:19:34.802
I don't know whether I would've
been any happier at Oxford

01:19:36.535 --> 01:19:38.749
it always had been a
dream to get into Oxford

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:40.875
I think being as people
had encouraged me

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:44.216
because I knew famous
people having been to Oxford

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.901
I'd read memoirs written
by famous people

01:19:47.902 --> 01:19:52.535
things such as Brideshead's Revisited
which was a great favourite

01:19:54.147 --> 01:19:56.265
but these I suppose are

01:19:56.743 --> 01:20:01.041
well they were dreams which
I had while I was at school and

01:20:01.789 --> 01:20:04.787
I have to just get over the
fact that I didn't get into Oxford

01:20:05.123 --> 01:20:07.459
probably because I didn't
approach the thing in the right way

01:20:09.082 --> 01:20:10.492
Are you bitter about it?

01:20:10.493 --> 01:20:12.933
I was very bitter at the time

01:20:12.934 --> 01:20:16.238
maybe I still am but
I try to get over it

01:20:16.635 --> 01:20:20.955
I think once I can get myself
going I can work solid, yeah

01:20:22.005 --> 01:20:23.519
but it's the motive

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.912
which is very hard to acquire when
you're in the flat most of the time

01:20:28.637 --> 01:20:32.068
it's hard to sort of look ahead to
next June and think of those exams

01:20:32.955 --> 01:20:36.256
but I dare say I'll do it, get the
average type degree and...

01:20:36.257 --> 01:20:37.929
I'm not worried

01:20:38.619 --> 01:20:43.023
Is it a problem to you
motivating yourself generally?

01:20:43.024 --> 01:20:44.697
Yeah it can be

01:20:44.698 --> 01:20:48.052
I can look back on the day
and think "how I wasted that"

01:20:48.439 --> 01:20:50.742
although I must've
enjoyed it at the time

01:20:50.743 --> 01:20:54.055
What sort of influence did
your parents have on you?

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:57.689
Well they made me believe
in god from the start

01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:00.279
which I certainly wouldn't

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.306
or I don't know even now
whether I believe in god or not

01:21:03.307 --> 01:21:05.877
I've thought an awful
lot about it actually and

01:21:05.878 --> 01:21:07.436
I still don't know

01:21:07.725 --> 01:21:09.497
but still this was the
absolutely certain one

01:21:09.498 --> 01:21:12.510
if one was to survive in the
world one had to believe in god

01:21:12.511 --> 01:21:14.433
this was something
which was taught to me

01:21:16.119 --> 01:21:19.153
always think of other
people first before yourself

01:21:19.154 --> 01:21:22.313
to a ridiculous neurotic degree

01:21:22.314 --> 01:21:24.397
which I think affected me

01:21:26.557 --> 01:21:27.967
What do you mean by that?

01:21:28.299 --> 01:21:31.722
Well this I suppose
is basic christianity

01:21:32.385 --> 01:21:33.569
it's sort of...

01:21:34.859 --> 01:21:38.126
if somebody slaps you on one cheek
let them do it on the other

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:40.824
almost literally taken

01:21:41.786 --> 01:21:45.210
which gave me a few shocks
when I tried to put it into practise

01:21:46.416 --> 01:21:48.282
- In what way?
- I don't think to be honest

01:21:48.283 --> 01:21:50.366
to go back to that
question I don't think

01:21:50.367 --> 01:21:54.304
I was really taught any sort of
policy of living at all by my parents

01:21:54.305 --> 01:21:56.208
this was probably
their biggest mistake

01:21:56.209 --> 01:21:58.296
that I was just left
to fend for myself

01:21:58.297 --> 01:22:01.223
in a world which they seemed
completely oblivious of

01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:06.115
and I found even when I tried to discuss
problems which were facing me in school

01:22:06.662 --> 01:22:09.957
my parents didn't seem to be
aware of the nature of the problem

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.708
Were they ambitious for you?

01:22:13.793 --> 01:22:16.714
Yeah but along set lines
which they had planned

01:22:16.715 --> 01:22:19.208
I think they have often
said to me that they

01:22:19.209 --> 01:22:22.926
they had seen me even from when I was
very young in a certain type of career

01:22:22.927 --> 01:22:28.834
and possibly they'd never even thought
that anything else was vaguely possible

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:31.948
they probably imagined I would be

01:22:31.949 --> 01:22:34.817
maybe a university lecturer or

01:22:35.996 --> 01:22:38.716
a bank manager or
something like this

01:22:39.613 --> 01:22:41.967
some kind of indoor work

01:22:41.968 --> 01:22:46.120
which involved writing and
reading and this sort of thing

01:22:46.414 --> 01:22:49.262
because they didn't take account
of the other side of my personality

01:22:50.698 --> 01:22:52.058
but

01:22:56.954 --> 01:23:01.715
I wonder how many parents really think
of their children as individual human beings

01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:06.526
What are your feelings about
them now? Your parents

01:23:08.028 --> 01:23:10.504
I'm glad they're there because
if I ever become homeless again

01:23:10.505 --> 01:23:12.174
I will be able to go
back and live with them

01:23:12.175 --> 01:23:13.962
they wouldn't object to this

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:20.094
I'm capable of getting on with
my parents perfectly well

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:28.446
If they are willing to let me live
as another adult in their house

01:23:28.447 --> 01:23:31.492
and appreciate that I'm
living my own way of life

01:23:31.493 --> 01:23:35.070
and that I am living there because I
can't think of anything else to do with myself

01:23:38.191 --> 01:23:40.933
What do they think of
what you're doing now?

01:23:42.462 --> 01:23:45.800
They accept it, I think now they
do accept that I'm the person I am

01:23:47.531 --> 01:23:55.396
they see this as simply my attempting
to add more experience to my life

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:58.208
which satisfies me

01:23:58.209 --> 01:23:59.886
Are they worried about you?

01:24:01.213 --> 01:24:02.936
Probably yes

01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:11.604
but no more worried now than they
were when I first left for university

01:24:11.605 --> 01:24:14.271
that was probably the time at
which they were most worried

01:24:15.731 --> 01:24:19.754
and we have in fact managed to
discuss a lot of personal things

01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.972
which I felt at one time I'd
never be able to discuss

01:24:25.032 --> 01:24:26.869
and therefore, as I say

01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:30.124
it is possible for me to live for a
few weeks even a month or so at home

01:24:30.693 --> 01:24:34.372
without there being
to much friction

01:24:35.838 --> 01:24:39.428
So are you under
pressure to get a job

01:24:39.429 --> 01:24:42.256
to think of what you're going
to do when you leave in June

01:24:42.766 --> 01:24:45.972
Yeah I suspect I am from my
parents, they keep dropping hints

01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:48.802
which is only fair I can
understand their feelings

01:24:49.041 --> 01:24:50.516
obviously I've
got to get a job

01:24:50.517 --> 01:24:53.083
I don't want to laze around on
the dole for months and months

01:24:53.084 --> 01:24:54.682
you'd go mad

01:24:55.806 --> 01:24:59.694
I just can't see what I'll be
doing in nine, ten months time though

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:03.112
Does that depress you
or does that excite you?

01:25:03.415 --> 01:25:05.558
No it certainly
doesn't depress me

01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:08.921
perhaps it does excite
me in a way yes

01:25:09.973 --> 01:25:13.314
something will turn up, something
of that nature y'know

01:25:13.747 --> 01:25:17.988
but obviously you've got to think
realistically about doing something

01:25:19.578 --> 01:25:22.790
I mean I might be living in
cloud cuckoo land y'know

01:25:24.297 --> 01:25:27.624
my mum and dad
might say "no son"

01:25:27.625 --> 01:25:29.534
"you don't get a job you like"

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.780
I'd like to think I could

01:25:31.781 --> 01:25:34.636
Well, we pretend we've got swords

01:25:35.152 --> 01:25:37.872
we make the noises of
the swords fighting

01:25:37.873 --> 01:25:40.165
and when somebody stabs
us we go "Arrrrrgghhh!"

01:25:40.866 --> 01:25:44.847
What goes through your mind
when you saw those two films

01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:48.472
when you were at
seven, bright and perky?

01:25:48.876 --> 01:25:53.164
I find it hard to believe that I was ever
like that but there's the evidence

01:25:53.165 --> 01:25:54.812
I wonder why I was like that

01:25:54.813 --> 01:25:58.330
I wonder what it was inside
me that made me like that

01:26:00.256 --> 01:26:03.759
and I can see even at fourteen and
I was beginning to get more subdued

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.194
and I was putting a lot more
thought into what I was saying

01:26:06.195 --> 01:26:08.473
too a ridiculous degree

01:26:11.036 --> 01:26:14.583
and probably when I was
seven I just..... I don't know

01:26:14.584 --> 01:26:18.400
I lived in a wonderful world where
everything was sensation dumb

01:26:18.401 --> 01:26:20.772
I could be happy like this I could
be miserable the next minute

01:26:20.773 --> 01:26:22.618
and I didn't have
to plan for the future

01:26:22.619 --> 01:26:25.790
I didn't have to worry about
having friends and all this money

01:26:25.791 --> 01:26:28.440
because everything was
so mapped out for me

01:26:29.864 --> 01:26:34.016
I don't know what sort of stumbling
blocks should be put in a child's way

01:26:34.541 --> 01:26:38.087
to get him used to living
in the outside world

01:26:39.046 --> 01:26:42.738
because I think maybe this is something
that was wrong in my upbringing

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:47.074
I didn't have enough obstacles to
get over, to toughen myself up against

01:26:48.188 --> 01:26:50.633
I was unprepared for
things as they were

01:26:50.634 --> 01:26:54.974
but looking back now I couldn't
think of what might have been done

01:26:54.975 --> 01:26:59.032
and I certainly wouldn't start
writing educational theory about this

01:26:59.033 --> 01:27:00.850
because I know how
personal a thing it is

01:27:00.851 --> 01:27:03.486
and it probably wouldn't
work in anybody else's case

01:27:04.712 --> 01:27:06.264
Would you like to
be seven again?

01:27:07.664 --> 01:27:10.574
No because I'd know that I
had to be twenty-one again

01:27:10.575 --> 01:27:12.638
I moved up to a
comprehensive school

01:27:13.281 --> 01:27:15.263
I found it much
bigger of course

01:27:15.264 --> 01:27:17.667
I found it hard to
settle into at first

01:27:17.668 --> 01:27:21.348
but now I've been here a few
years I know my way around

01:27:21.349 --> 01:27:24.002
I think it's a very good
idea to have competition

01:27:24.003 --> 01:27:27.113
otherwise you might start
to relax and not try hard enough

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:33.638
Yes at that age I was very
conscious of having to struggle

01:27:33.639 --> 01:27:36.056
because I suppose of what
parents and teachers were saying

01:27:36.057 --> 01:27:36.984
they were saying

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:41.246
they said "you've got a brain you
must put all your effort into school work"

01:27:44.089 --> 01:27:45.824
well what else could
they have said?

01:27:45.825 --> 01:27:48.466
I would've probably been
just as angry, looking back

01:27:48.467 --> 01:27:52.192
if they'd never encouraged
my intellectual efforts at all

01:27:52.193 --> 01:27:55.494
When I get married I don't
want to have any children

01:27:56.324 --> 01:27:57.396
because

01:27:57.397 --> 01:28:00.174
they are always
doing naughty things

01:28:00.175 --> 01:28:03.074
and making the
whole house untidy

01:28:03.075 --> 01:28:05.935
Do you have any
great ambition, any dream?

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:11.010
I suppose I...

01:28:11.304 --> 01:28:12.612
yes well...

01:28:12.613 --> 01:28:17.212
I would like to be someone in a position
of importance and I've always thought this

01:28:17.822 --> 01:28:21.642
but I don't think I'm the right sort of person
to carry the responsibility for whatever it is

01:28:21.643 --> 01:28:24.171
I've always thought
well I'd love to be

01:28:25.186 --> 01:28:28.052
possibly even love
to be in politics

01:28:28.496 --> 01:28:29.764
Something like this

01:28:29.765 --> 01:28:30.866
but eh...

01:28:31.461 --> 01:28:36.992
I suppose that I'd probably find just as
tedious as all the other jobs I've done so...

01:28:37.804 --> 01:28:40.348
What do you want out of life?

01:28:45.227 --> 01:28:48.545
The satisfaction of knowing

01:28:48.778 --> 01:28:52.807
that I've left some sort of imprint

01:28:52.808 --> 01:28:55.609
rather than just
lived out my life

01:28:56.963 --> 01:28:58.755
I don't know....

01:28:59.387 --> 01:29:03.438
it's going to sound like an epitaph
I've left in memory of some people y'know

01:29:04.651 --> 01:29:10.023
not that this guy worked, made a fair
bit of money, good house, died

01:29:10.959 --> 01:29:13.455
I'd like to have done
something but...

01:29:13.456 --> 01:29:16.357
then again it must be a
drop in the ocean I suppose

01:29:16.358 --> 01:29:18.993
I mean who is going to remember
me in a hundred years time?

01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:22.588
So is it that important,
how you live out your life?

01:29:22.809 --> 01:29:25.946
but I would like to think
I'm going to do something with it

01:29:25.947 --> 01:29:27.987
something positive

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:30.292
Do you and Peter have
the same values?

01:29:30.293 --> 01:29:33.683
I think we both value
happiness and stability

01:29:33.684 --> 01:29:35.483
I think most people do

01:29:38.429 --> 01:29:41.003
But you've kicked against
the stability that's..

01:29:41.838 --> 01:29:45.935
I don't think I ever had any
stability, to be quite honest

01:29:46.837 --> 01:29:49.627
I can't think of any time
in my life when I ever did

01:29:49.628 --> 01:29:51.813
I don't think I've been
kicking against anything

01:29:51.814 --> 01:29:54.931
I think I've been kicking in
mid-air the whole of my life

01:30:09.516 --> 01:30:11.091
It's only one more

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.982
What do they think
about each other?

01:30:22.983 --> 01:30:24.821
and how would they act together?

01:30:25.327 --> 01:30:29.587
to find out we invited them
all to one big party and joined in

01:30:29.963 --> 01:30:32.493
#If I say that I love you#

01:30:32.494 --> 01:30:34.939
#and you know it's true#

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:37.545
#if you said that you'd leave me#

01:30:37.546 --> 01:30:40.651
#what would I do?#

01:30:41.325 --> 01:30:45.869
#I'll let you back if you let me#

01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:51.025
#I'll change your mind......#

01:30:53.235 --> 01:30:56.755
Yes but they were a bit
too tough for my liking

01:30:56.756 --> 01:31:00.965
so they hit me right in the back
and I've still got a pain there

01:31:00.966 --> 01:31:05.017
The posh ones,
"Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes!"

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:07.737
they're nuts

01:31:07.738 --> 01:31:10.571
you just have to touch them

01:31:10.572 --> 01:31:14.130
Well some of them
were rather dirty

01:31:15.439 --> 01:31:19.295
- What do you think about them?
- I played with them quite naturally

01:31:19.296 --> 01:31:21.745
I think they were
rather nice really

01:31:21.746 --> 01:31:24.149
What do you think
about rich people?

01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:27.963
Well... not much

01:31:28.767 --> 01:31:29.730
Tell me about them

01:31:29.731 --> 01:31:33.903
Well they think they can do
everything without you doing it as well

01:31:33.904 --> 01:31:41.933
and they think just because they're rich
they have to have people to do all their work

01:31:41.934 --> 01:31:46.631
What would you do if you had
lots of money, about two pounds?

01:31:46.632 --> 01:31:49.668
Me? I would help the poor

01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:50.863
What for?

01:31:50.864 --> 01:31:55.489
The poor, if you don't help
them they die soon wouldn't they

01:31:55.490 --> 01:32:01.363
and every time we have a harvest
festival we send food to them

01:32:01.364 --> 01:32:02.977
and once these two.....no

01:32:04.103 --> 01:32:08.151
Susan and Janet Simpson went
round giving it out with Mr Floyd

01:32:08.525 --> 01:32:11.022
- I don't think much of the accents
- Neither do I

01:32:11.023 --> 01:32:12.699
Neither do I

01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:15.422
it won't prevent
me liking them

01:32:15.423 --> 01:32:16.596
Don't you ever
think to yourself -

01:32:16.597 --> 01:32:18.702
Jump out of that suit,
come to the Eastend

01:32:18.703 --> 01:32:21.463
throw the books in the corner
and do what you have to do

01:32:21.464 --> 01:32:24.001
- I'd certainly throw the books in the corner
- Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

01:32:24.002 --> 01:32:24.651
Yeah

01:32:24.652 --> 01:32:27.863
- What are you going to do in life?
- I've really no idea

01:32:28.063 --> 01:32:33.232
The idea of just living somewhere and
working for a living is just horrifying really

01:32:33.233 --> 01:32:35.807
I mean, being a
student is very easy

01:32:35.808 --> 01:32:38.693
I just postponed the decision
by going to university

01:32:38.694 --> 01:32:41.556
I wouldn't say being a student's
easy, that's why I left school

01:32:41.996 --> 01:32:44.296
- It was too hard
- Really

01:32:44.297 --> 01:32:46.829
Who is to say what a
seven year old child is?

01:32:47.971 --> 01:32:52.025
I don't think there's anyway you can do it so a
seven year old child could seem to be one thing

01:32:52.026 --> 01:32:57.447
and you could always argue that the end
product was produced by what he actually was

01:32:57.448 --> 01:32:59.523
rather than what
he seemed to be

01:32:59.524 --> 01:33:02.779
- you'd normally use the total....
- Not a bookmaker but a....

01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:05.331
- I'm always frightened they'd clear off
- What?

01:33:05.332 --> 01:33:07.985
I'm always frightened they'd clear
off if they had a bad afternoon

01:33:07.986 --> 01:33:10.113
No they're not like that,
they can always get hold of money

01:33:10.114 --> 01:33:12.949
What fears do you
have for the future?

01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:15.517
Well certainly the idea of,
as I was saying before

01:33:15.518 --> 01:33:19.441
getting into a job and simply
getting stuck in it and that's it

01:33:19.442 --> 01:33:22.195
without knowing
why you're doing it

01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:27.517
but I would think now that this is the time
where I would think about something like that

01:33:27.518 --> 01:33:29.077
and make sure
it doesn't happen

01:33:29.078 --> 01:33:32.127
I really don't see how
one's life can be a failure

01:33:32.128 --> 01:33:33.227
in that....

01:33:33.228 --> 01:33:36.961
if I became a journalist
and got sacked at thirty

01:33:36.962 --> 01:33:40.289
probably because I had grown out of it or I
had changed so I was no longer suitable

01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:46.080
therefore I'd find something
else which I enjoyed

01:33:46.081 --> 01:33:47.763
and which my talents
were suited to

01:33:47.764 --> 01:33:51.573
No I have never suffered at all

01:33:52.297 --> 01:33:58.439
never been driven to
despair or tears or....

01:34:01.113 --> 01:34:03.053
I don't know, have
any of the others?

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:06.254
My strength is being
able to keep going really

01:34:06.255 --> 01:34:10.517
and my weakness is not being able
to take any positive course of action

01:34:10.908 --> 01:34:15.516
I suppose I tend to behave in the
fashion of the people that I'm with

01:34:16.253 --> 01:34:19.667
in some circumstances I think that
can be quite a weakness sometimes

01:34:19.668 --> 01:34:21.775
sometimes wish I didn't

01:34:22.423 --> 01:34:27.974
occasionally look at myself and think "christ
you're a bloody fool, what are you doing now?"

01:34:29.278 --> 01:34:31.299
and that sometimes disturbs me

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.579
We had a teacher at school

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:37.059
that his favourite ploy was....

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:41.106
"All you girls want to do is walk
out, get married, have babies

01:34:41.107 --> 01:34:44.873
and push a pram down the road with a
cigarette hanging out the side of your mouth"

01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:50.005
god if there was ever a sentence
I'd resent it would be that one - yeah

01:34:50.006 --> 01:34:53.090
There's only one ambition
really I want a baby son

01:34:53.091 --> 01:34:55.970
if I see my baby son that'll
be my ambition fulfilled

01:34:55.971 --> 01:34:58.501
no one knows that,
only you now!

01:34:58.502 --> 01:35:02.589
Well to me it is a dream
to be totally happy

01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:05.527
I mean, I don't think
you can expect that but...

01:35:07.995 --> 01:35:13.203
What happens if you don't make that?
If you don't ever find it? How will you cope?

01:35:13.204 --> 01:35:16.405
I don't know, it
would be hard to say

01:35:17.155 --> 01:35:21.343
the human minds very strong
and it can be very weak

01:35:21.745 --> 01:35:25.369
and so you could crack up
from it and you could just

01:35:25.705 --> 01:35:30.937
live your life out from day to day
and you could get over it I think

01:35:30.938 --> 01:35:34.907
well not get over it but you'd
sort of cope with it I think

01:35:35.338 --> 01:35:37.961
but what I'd do
I just don't know

01:35:40.731 --> 01:35:44.171
I mean I want to be happy and
my dreams are all for happiness

01:35:45.666 --> 01:35:47.855
but basically that's what
I want out of life

01:35:47.856 --> 01:35:52.303
I always leave something inside
me, I always leave a bit behind

01:35:52.765 --> 01:35:56.163
I always hold back a
bit with everything I do

01:35:59.549 --> 01:36:03.097
just to sort of....something
to fall back on

01:36:03.098 --> 01:36:07.260
I've always got something else to look
on if anything goes wrong anywhere

01:36:08.535 --> 01:36:11.920
What is that something
you hold back?

01:36:11.921 --> 01:36:14.319
I think it's a part
of my heart

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.843
What do you want
most out of life?

01:36:18.015 --> 01:36:21.647
To be happy and
get on with life

01:36:21.648 --> 01:36:26.170
you don't want to just sit
back and let it always pass

01:36:27.729 --> 01:36:29.690
you could be run over
by a bus tomorrow

01:36:29.691 --> 01:36:31.710
so you've got to make the
most of it while you've got it

01:36:31.711 --> 01:36:35.219
Simply to be able to wake
up in the morning and feel that

01:36:35.681 --> 01:36:38.109
this day was going
to be worthwhile

01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:43.467
which is what I don't
feel at the moment

01:36:56.245 --> 01:36:59.337
At the end of their very
special day in London

01:36:59.338 --> 01:37:02.059
after their trip to
the zoo and the party

01:37:02.597 --> 01:37:05.645
we took our children to
an adventure playground

01:37:05.646 --> 01:37:07.914
where they could do
just what they liked

01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:14.315
those from a children's home
set about building a house

01:37:14.316 --> 01:37:18.659
The houses in Australia, the average
sort of living there will do me fine

01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:19.956
I mean it's terrific

01:37:19.957 --> 01:37:23.124
I often say I'm saving to
settle down with Yvonne

01:37:24.027 --> 01:37:27.665
and then I think to myself "nah
I might buy a car instead"

01:37:34.643 --> 01:37:36.267
There's Nicholas

01:37:36.268 --> 01:37:39.367
You have to run fast
to stay where you are

01:37:39.368 --> 01:37:42.667
to go forward you have to run very
fast indeed, or whatever the quote is

01:37:44.219 --> 01:37:48.187
so I'll probably feel I'm
actually achieving nothing

01:37:49.519 --> 01:37:51.097
and Tony

01:37:54.015 --> 01:37:57.417
I don't want to change
because if I change

01:37:57.418 --> 01:38:00.698
it proves the other Tony
Walker was all fake

01:38:02.549 --> 01:38:03.610
Andrew

01:38:04.169 --> 01:38:09.068
After I've qualified as a
Solicitor I'll have to rethink

01:38:09.911 --> 01:38:12.343
I don't know at all what
will happen after that

01:38:12.344 --> 01:38:13.733
and Bruce

01:38:16.879 --> 01:38:20.737
It all springs from.....

01:38:21.207 --> 01:38:24.295
loving god and christ I suppose

01:38:24.953 --> 01:38:29.305
you try and do that as best as possible
and that leads your actions in life

01:38:31.397 --> 01:38:32.762
John

01:38:32.785 --> 01:38:37.226
I'd quite like to go into politics but
that's easier said than done

01:38:39.867 --> 01:38:41.033
Susie

01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:44.909
When you're a child you always think
how nice it would be to be grown up

01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:47.035
and independent and things

01:38:47.036 --> 01:38:50.536
but there are times when
I wish I was three again

01:38:50.537 --> 01:38:53.139
Jackie and her friends

01:38:58.721 --> 01:39:01.387
give me a child
until he is seven

01:39:01.438 --> 01:39:04.131
and I will give you the man

01:39:12.496 --> 01:39:16.178
this has been a glimpse
of Britain's future
