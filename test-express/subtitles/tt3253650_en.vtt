LITTLE ENGLAND

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:25.656
<i>Let a love...</i>

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:30.825
<i>... that does not save...</i>

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:37.700
<i>... find me alone...</i>

00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:48.580
<i>One night, one dawn...</i>

00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:57.501
<i>One night, one dawn.</i>

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:05.501
<i>Our love...</i>

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:09.383
<i>... a sea...</i>

00:01:11.307 --> 00:01:17.143
<i>... a tempest in the soul...</i>

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:24.264
<i>Love...</i>

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:29.177
<i>... a myriad waves...</i>

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:36.145
<i>... and it all begins again...</i>

00:01:46.787 --> 00:01:49.824
BASED ON THE NOVEL
BY IOANNA KARYSTIANI

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:58.623
A FILM BY
PANTELIS VOULGARIS

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:03.265
There they are! They're here!
You can see them!

00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:06.305
ANDROS 1930

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:10.222
Where's Maritsa?
Didn't she hear the siren?

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:12.144
You can see it!

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.579
They're probably looking at us
too, through their binoculars.

00:02:16.547 --> 00:02:18.822
Till we meet again, Yannis!

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:24.940
It's the OSTRIA
on its way to Piraeus.

00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:29.424
<i>Odessa, 2nd May 1930.</i>

00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:32.223
<i>My beloved Orsa...</i>

00:02:32.587 --> 00:02:36.978
<i>My uncle Emilios tells no one
that he gives you my letters.</i>

00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:41.026
<i>I've taught him well.
So, don't be afraid.</i>

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.537
<i>We'll be in Piraeus in mid-May.</i>

00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:48.264
<i>We unload and 3-4 days later
we head for Andros. I can't wait.</i>

00:02:48.307 --> 00:02:51.026
<i>I hope you feel the same way
about seeing me.</i>

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:54.104
<i>When I left, you were 17
and now you're 20.</i>

00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:56.258
<i>Spyros Maltabes.</i>

00:03:17.147 --> 00:03:18.057
For you.

00:03:31.347 --> 00:03:35.260
Orsa, the Ostria we'll be sailing off
again in two months.

00:03:37.307 --> 00:03:42.540
Spyros, will we be able to see
each other many more times?

00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:46.986
As you long as you keep finding
good excuses!

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:50.542
I'll tell them I'm going
to Grandma Orsa.

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:56.300
I'll sit with her
for fifteen minutes or so...

00:03:57.347 --> 00:03:59.019
...and after that...

00:04:25.547 --> 00:04:28.345
<i>Las senales del alma...</i>

00:04:34.027 --> 00:04:37.303
<i>You could even catch
the radio signals of the souls...</i>

00:04:37.547 --> 00:04:42.496
<i>Now who will I tell about the
heartache that is gnawing at me?</i>

00:04:42.547 --> 00:04:44.697
<i>Same yearning...</i>

00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:48.737
<i>You in Chile, me in Buenos Aires.</i>

00:04:58.427 --> 00:05:02.818
<i>Savvas, you may be rotting
in the Atlantic...</i>

00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:05.576
<i>... but I'm not wasting
my time either.</i>

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:09.417
<i>The two-story house is
finished. Their dowry.</i>

00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:12.581
<i>It's time I married them off.</i>

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.185
Dry land, Nikiforos...

00:05:21.347 --> 00:05:23.258
Foreign soil...

00:05:25.547 --> 00:05:27.299
...but still soil...

00:05:36.147 --> 00:05:37.546
Moscha!

00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:41.218
Moscha!

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:55.663
Write up the receipts,
all the expenses...

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.661
...and send them to your father.

00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:03.778
Tomorrow at the latest.

00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:06.707
Dad will be so worried...

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:09.098
...how much you paid
for the teacups...

00:06:09.147 --> 00:06:12.583
...how much for the colanders,
the soaps...

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:18.417
Use the thinnest paper. We don't
want to pay a fortune in stamps.

00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:21.700
Or worry about the weight
of feeling either...

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.019
Karaoulanis...

00:06:27.307 --> 00:06:30.060
Sofas for upstairs and
sofas for downstairs.

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:32.025
Two silver tureens...

00:06:32.067 --> 00:06:36.026
Lace curtains for upstairs and
lace curtains for downstairs.

00:06:36.267 --> 00:06:39.498
I'll be equally fair to both of you,
both of you.

00:06:41.587 --> 00:06:43.464
Karaoulanis...

00:06:43.907 --> 00:06:46.979
One for the upstairs house,
one for the downstairs house.

00:06:47.027 --> 00:06:49.985
Don't forget two pairs
of binoculars as well...

00:06:50.027 --> 00:06:52.097
For us to look through them...

00:06:52.147 --> 00:06:54.024
...as we grow old and rusty...

00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:56.144
...like the railings of the balcony.

00:07:03.147 --> 00:07:09.177
<i>Recipient: Savvas Saltaferos,
Captain.</i>

00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:14.463
<i>Ship: SS PENELOPE, Argentina.</i>

00:07:18.227 --> 00:07:19.979
<i>Ready...</i>

00:07:21.907 --> 00:07:25.024
Yesterday we had the memorial
service for the radio operator...

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:27.383
...who worked with my father.
- I was there.

00:07:28.107 --> 00:07:31.224
But we shouldn't be talking
about such things now.

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:34.577
I can't bear the thought
that men are lost at sea...

00:07:34.907 --> 00:07:36.101
...far away...

00:07:38.147 --> 00:07:40.741
...and their remains
never return to Andros.

00:07:40.947 --> 00:07:42.824
His grave here is empty.

00:07:44.107 --> 00:07:47.986
Did they bury him in Argentina?
In Uruguay?

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.227
He was lucky to die near land.

00:07:52.947 --> 00:07:56.986
The Maltabes men, grandfather,
father, uncles...

00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.462
...we drown in the middle
of the ocean.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.219
We like it there.

00:08:04.507 --> 00:08:06.384
Don't you talk that way...

00:08:07.027 --> 00:08:08.142
Don't you talk that way...

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.939
What with the shipwrecks...

00:08:10.147 --> 00:08:13.105
...what with the diseases that
suddenly break out at sea.

00:08:13.147 --> 00:08:16.583
I drive a hard bargain
with the Grim Reaper.

00:08:17.347 --> 00:08:20.020
- I'm not afraid.
- But I am.

00:08:29.627 --> 00:08:31.777
Anyone who drowned...

00:08:47.147 --> 00:08:48.819
...repented...

00:09:08.307 --> 00:09:12.300
I fell in love at 12,
got engaged at 13...

00:09:12.707 --> 00:09:16.780
...got married at 14,
was widowed at 15.

00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:24.904
The SS MAROUSIO sank
with all hands on board.

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.456
That's why I can
no longer look at the sea.

00:09:28.547 --> 00:09:30.742
That's why I never eat fish.

00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:35.825
I can't get it out of my head that
they may have devoured Vangelis.

00:09:44.107 --> 00:09:45.222
It's not the only one.

00:09:45.547 --> 00:09:47.458
I embroider
all the island's shipwrecks.

00:09:47.747 --> 00:09:50.307
How can you bear it?
You shouldn't do it any more.

00:09:50.547 --> 00:09:52.105
I can't.
I don't want to...

00:09:52.147 --> 00:09:55.059
...abandon plaintive souls?
- Well, I do!

00:09:55.107 --> 00:09:59.146
I want everything I can't have...
Everything they won't let me have.

00:10:01.387 --> 00:10:02.183
Katerina...

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:09.741
- I want his initials, you know whose.
- Moscha!

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:11.978
I want you to embroider them
for me on a handkerchief.

00:10:12.027 --> 00:10:14.666
- I can't do that.
- You'll get half a little sovereign.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:15.777
No.

00:10:15.987 --> 00:10:17.943
He's a foreigner, Moscha...

00:10:19.027 --> 00:10:20.699
And he's not a seaman...

00:10:20.907 --> 00:10:23.375
That's why I've set my sights
on him.

00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:33.255
Spyros...

00:10:33.547 --> 00:10:37.062
We're having a soiree
at the lighthouse keeper's...

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.139
And you took the rum too...

00:10:39.187 --> 00:10:41.018
Cuban.

00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:43.627
It's the best way to get drunk...

00:10:43.987 --> 00:10:45.306
I know... I know...

00:10:45.747 --> 00:10:48.466
After the third glass I'll be...

00:10:49.307 --> 00:10:50.660
...in Vera Cruz!

00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:53.986
After the fifth?

00:10:54.027 --> 00:10:56.461
Vera Cruz is just fine, boy...

00:11:02.347 --> 00:11:07.375
Uncle Emilios, why don't you come
with us on one last journey...

00:11:08.587 --> 00:11:10.225
...for old times sake...

00:11:11.787 --> 00:11:15.177
The sea rejected me.
Willy-nilly...

00:11:17.107 --> 00:11:21.020
- It threw me up.
- Yes... the Bay of Biscay.

00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:24.741
We won't be crossing
the Bay of Biscay.

00:11:25.067 --> 00:11:29.026
I cross the Bay of Biscay
every night...

00:11:29.427 --> 00:11:31.099
...in my sleep...

00:11:31.147 --> 00:11:33.297
...tied with ropes...

00:11:33.347 --> 00:11:35.019
...all of us tied...

00:11:35.347 --> 00:11:40.660
...and the waves untie them and
sweep the 16-year old kid away.

00:11:43.027 --> 00:11:46.337
Did you go... to the five?

00:11:50.187 --> 00:11:52.143
Every afternoon... late.

00:11:55.267 --> 00:11:56.825
I tell them...

00:11:57.227 --> 00:11:58.785
...good evening.

00:11:59.027 --> 00:12:03.179
<i>Let a love that does not save...</i>

00:12:03.907 --> 00:12:08.105
<i>... finds me alone.</i>

00:12:08.987 --> 00:12:12.377
<i>One night, one dawn...</i>

00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:14.622
Shoulder to waist 48.

00:12:14.987 --> 00:12:18.582
<i>One night, one dawn.</i>

00:12:19.387 --> 00:12:21.025
98.

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:24.976
<i>Our love a sea...</i>

00:12:25.027 --> 00:12:28.099
I'll have it ready for you
next Saturday.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.900
<i>... a tempest in the soul...</i>

00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:36.182
<i>Love a myriad waves...</i>

00:12:36.227 --> 00:12:40.505
<i>... and it all begins again.</i>

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.225
Vivika!

00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:51.180
Run along and water the dahlias,
my child.

00:12:51.227 --> 00:12:53.024
So, what were we saying, Mouraina?

00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:57.504
Ah, yes... the man's cock
was like a mainmast...

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:00.097
...before he left.

00:13:00.147 --> 00:13:05.221
If he's horny now, it's other women's
panties he'll be dirtying.

00:13:05.547 --> 00:13:08.459
Just like Nikiforos,
God rest his soul. A bigamist.

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:14.061
He had a second wife in Chile
and two Chilean daughters...

00:13:14.347 --> 00:13:17.623
...with the same names
of his daughters here.

00:13:17.987 --> 00:13:19.705
You mean Tassoula and Vangelio?

00:13:19.947 --> 00:13:21.778
Tassoula and Vangelio in Chile?

00:13:22.107 --> 00:13:24.462
Did Savvas write you
about it, Mina?

00:13:24.787 --> 00:13:27.859
He never writes about such things
to me, Mouraina.

00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:31.942
It's Nikiforos' widow herself who
complained about it to my face.

00:13:32.267 --> 00:13:37.057
I saved the best lemon orchard
for you. Sixty trees.

00:13:39.427 --> 00:13:43.056
For you, only the biggest bargains,
for the others, the leftovers.

00:13:43.467 --> 00:13:46.186
But we had agreed 18 pounds.

00:13:46.467 --> 00:13:48.344
15 or I leave.

00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:57.021
We'll sign the deed the day
after tomorrow. St. Marina's Day.

00:13:57.067 --> 00:13:58.978
God bless investments, eh?

00:14:01.107 --> 00:14:04.144
The day after tomorrow,
on St. Marina's Day.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:08.420
Calm down, Mina, I've got
another windfall for you.

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:12.262
<i>Rock fish, red mullet, bogue,
sea bream, red snapper!</i>

00:14:12.787 --> 00:14:18.419
Nikos Vatokouzis. Unmarried.
A captain at 32.

00:14:18.787 --> 00:14:21.506
Owns half shares in two steamboats.

00:14:21.867 --> 00:14:23.664
And he studied mathematics.

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:25.380
He didn't graduate though...

00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:30.183
His governess Annezio is the
most loyal and faithful servant...

00:14:30.227 --> 00:14:32.263
...in all of Andros.

00:14:32.507 --> 00:14:33.906
And the deafest.

00:14:35.067 --> 00:14:36.978
And what about his house?

00:14:37.187 --> 00:14:40.224
Isn't it one of the most beautiful
residences in the city?

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:43.186
We've got a house too, Kourmoulis.

00:14:45.107 --> 00:14:48.099
His late mother lent you
the money for the plot.

00:14:48.147 --> 00:14:50.581
I keep all my old records.

00:14:52.187 --> 00:14:55.179
She also stood by me
on other occasions.

00:14:57.827 --> 00:14:59.818
Always open-handed.

00:15:00.627 --> 00:15:02.060
Now you're talking.

00:15:03.227 --> 00:15:07.220
<i>Peach blossoms on his sides...</i>

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:10.905
<i>... she had said to me, in terror.</i>

00:15:11.147 --> 00:15:15.345
<i>It was the rashes of syphilis...
her husband's.</i>

00:15:16.947 --> 00:15:22.021
<i>Then... he went blind, crazy...</i>

00:15:22.747 --> 00:15:24.624
<i>And then, he kicked the bucket.</i>

00:15:24.867 --> 00:15:26.220
<i>The son is clean.</i>

00:15:35.667 --> 00:15:37.464
<i>Postman!</i>

00:15:37.747 --> 00:15:39.146
<i>Letters!</i>

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:41.737
<i>From Brazil!</i>

00:15:42.427 --> 00:15:44.895
<i>From Canada!
From Poland!</i>

00:15:45.267 --> 00:15:48.100
<i>Argentina! Panama!</i>

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:50.578
<i>Australia!</i>

00:16:18.387 --> 00:16:22.903
That's your color.
Cypress green.

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:46.898
I'm leaving tomorrow.

00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:54.060
When I return I'll be a captain.

00:16:55.947 --> 00:16:58.415
And we'll get married
the very same day.

00:16:58.867 --> 00:17:01.142
And what revelry there'll be...

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:03.298
...with dulcimers and lutes...

00:17:13.027 --> 00:17:15.495
The cave in the rock...

00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:23.224
The cypress trees...

00:17:24.507 --> 00:17:26.577
...the little bridge...

00:17:40.187 --> 00:17:42.257
The Maltabes Circle!

00:17:45.187 --> 00:17:47.542
That's what I named it.

00:18:04.227 --> 00:18:07.378
For as long as you're away I'll come
to our places alone and remember.

00:18:12.427 --> 00:18:14.019
No jasmine today?

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:20.544
Their fragrance is best suited
to the dusk...

00:18:23.867 --> 00:18:25.141
...the night...

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:30.657
I'll plant ten in our flowerbeds.

00:18:31.507 --> 00:18:34.340
We'll stay awake all night
and breathe them in.

00:18:34.587 --> 00:18:37.101
We'll stay awake all night
and breathe them in.

00:18:53.227 --> 00:18:56.264
Wait for me, eh?

00:19:25.107 --> 00:19:27.143
Wait for me!

00:19:30.547 --> 00:19:33.664
<i>- The valerian root didn't work.
- No good for you either?</i>

00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:38.384
<i>Then, my dear, let's try something
more potent... Veronal.</i>

00:19:41.587 --> 00:19:46.058
Have you ever prescribed Salvarsan
for Nikos Vatokouzis?

00:19:46.427 --> 00:19:48.224
No.

00:19:51.387 --> 00:19:55.505
Bismuth! Mercury? Iodine?

00:19:57.107 --> 00:19:59.337
No.

00:20:00.027 --> 00:20:01.779
No.

00:20:04.827 --> 00:20:07.295
Tell me, Resvanis...

00:20:09.827 --> 00:20:13.581
...this isn't a matter
of doctor-patient confidentiality?

00:20:15.587 --> 00:20:19.023
No, Mina, because I realize
what it's all about.

00:20:20.907 --> 00:20:24.297
I'm not a venereologist. I'm a GP.

00:20:25.387 --> 00:20:28.777
But based on timelines
and the records I keep...

00:20:29.787 --> 00:20:33.143
...I believe Vatokouzis' son
was conceived...

00:20:33.547 --> 00:20:38.575
...2 years before the old man, God
rest his soul, contracted the disease.

00:20:43.347 --> 00:20:45.622
<i>Music lovers of Andros.</i>

00:20:45.867 --> 00:20:50.497
<i>This evening Miss Hexadaktylou
will be giving a piano recital.</i>

00:20:51.267 --> 00:20:55.499
<i>Don't miss the musical feast
with European melodies!</i>

00:20:57.467 --> 00:21:01.585
165 postcards.
My pupils don't forget me.

00:21:03.587 --> 00:21:06.101
And Mikes' pupils loved him.

00:21:06.467 --> 00:21:10.301
<i>Your attention please!
At 9:00 this evening...</i>

00:21:10.547 --> 00:21:12.902
I'm a literature teacher
by profession.

00:21:13.227 --> 00:21:15.616
I'm still a schoolgirl
by disposition.

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:19.537
Go on, tell me...
Who is he?

00:21:25.427 --> 00:21:27.304
Like an avalanche in the Alps!

00:21:27.547 --> 00:21:30.220
Ah! An off-topic answer.
I'll give you a D!

00:21:30.547 --> 00:21:33.186
He gave me an A.

00:21:33.547 --> 00:21:36.107
But what am I saying?
He must be a seaman. What else?

00:21:36.147 --> 00:21:40.140
Voyages, oceans,
thousands of miles...

00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:43.897
The blue flows
and we flow with it.

00:21:47.027 --> 00:21:50.303
So, who is he?
Name and surname.

00:21:50.627 --> 00:21:53.824
- I'd rather not say.
- He isn't married, is he?

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:55.580
No!

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:57.539
No!

00:21:57.907 --> 00:22:01.217
You've always been such
a one for secrets...

00:22:01.467 --> 00:22:03.742
You feed on them,
you're bewitched by them.

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:08.376
I felt my heart burst open
like a pomegranate...

00:22:08.987 --> 00:22:10.818
...without a sound...

00:22:11.187 --> 00:22:14.065
...and the little rubies
forming arcs in the air...

00:22:14.107 --> 00:22:16.177
...stumbling over my shoulders...

00:22:16.227 --> 00:22:19.617
...leaping on the cobbled streets
like fireflies.

00:22:19.987 --> 00:22:21.420
Go on...

00:22:24.627 --> 00:22:27.664
He looks at me and I'm on fire...

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:31.661
...like a little piece of coal
in an incense burner.

00:22:31.907 --> 00:22:33.181
He just looks at you?

00:22:37.347 --> 00:22:39.019
Nana...

00:22:39.747 --> 00:22:44.025
...a man's fingers are heavy.

00:22:45.427 --> 00:22:49.500
They just touch you
and you turn to stone.

00:23:30.707 --> 00:23:33.983
He must be sailing the Cape Verde
as we speak.

00:23:35.187 --> 00:23:40.625
And you came at his behest
ask for the hand of my Orsa...

00:23:40.947 --> 00:23:43.097
...who is, by general consent...

00:23:43.347 --> 00:23:47.545
...10-15 kilos short of
being a true Aphrodite!

00:23:50.267 --> 00:23:56.137
See here Emilios, your nephew
has yet to make his fortune.

00:23:58.907 --> 00:24:00.784
He's a second mate.

00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:04.224
There are captains who have asked me
for her hand in marriage.

00:24:04.267 --> 00:24:07.577
Spyros will be a captain too,
before he turns 30.

00:24:07.987 --> 00:24:09.136
Will be...

00:24:12.307 --> 00:24:14.582
He doesn't even have his own house.

00:24:16.547 --> 00:24:19.141
- He will have.
- Will have...

00:24:19.187 --> 00:24:23.100
He's a hard worker.
Quick on the uptake.

00:24:24.187 --> 00:24:26.223
Outgoing...

00:24:26.267 --> 00:24:28.781
I raised him...

00:24:35.027 --> 00:24:37.143
...since he was five.

00:24:37.187 --> 00:24:41.260
A governess.
Knee deep in pigeon shit.

00:24:43.507 --> 00:24:49.104
Captain Savvas respects those
who make a living at sea.

00:24:52.027 --> 00:24:54.336
He values good seamen.

00:24:56.307 --> 00:24:58.138
You should ask his opinion.

00:24:58.627 --> 00:25:03.257
He commands his ship.
I command the household.

00:25:07.147 --> 00:25:10.105
You never know what the future
holds for a seaman, Emilios.

00:25:10.507 --> 00:25:13.738
I must ensure my daughter's security.

00:25:13.987 --> 00:25:16.945
A life without money
is a life without joy.

00:25:21.707 --> 00:25:23.265
Don't tell me...

00:25:24.787 --> 00:25:29.065
Don't tell me they have feelings
for each other!

00:25:30.347 --> 00:25:34.056
Don't tell me your charmer nephew
has mistaken my daughter...

00:25:34.387 --> 00:25:36.537
...for a harbor whore?

00:25:40.307 --> 00:25:42.184
We're adults now.

00:25:44.307 --> 00:25:47.265
We know the sorrows every house has.

00:25:59.507 --> 00:26:04.058
Mina... a heavy purse
isn't everything.

00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:09.060
There are a lot of sacred things
involved. My hands are tied.

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:12.425
I owe a soul a debt of gratitude.

00:26:21.427 --> 00:26:22.064
And!

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:26.056
<i>Katina, Kiki, Moscha and Marie!</i>

00:26:26.427 --> 00:26:31.217
<i>The 4-member KKMM sorority!</i>

00:26:31.707 --> 00:26:36.019
<i>Katina, Kiki, Moscha, Marie...</i>

00:26:36.307 --> 00:26:39.060
<i>We'll be together for all eternity!</i>

00:26:40.227 --> 00:26:41.819
Here's a new one.

00:26:42.227 --> 00:26:46.664
<i>Oh Andros, my little island
in the sea...</i>

00:26:46.947 --> 00:26:50.576
<i>A musty, dismal prison
you are to me.</i>

00:26:50.987 --> 00:26:54.138
<i>Great and famous you'll never be.</i>

00:26:54.187 --> 00:26:57.179
<i>An empty fart for all eternity!</i>

00:26:58.747 --> 00:27:02.626
Such a tiny place and they went and
christened it "Little England"!

00:27:02.947 --> 00:27:06.337
"Little England" indeed! No relation
to the real England I'm sure.

00:27:06.547 --> 00:27:09.459
- Well there are a lot of boats!
- And two-bit snobs...

00:27:09.787 --> 00:27:13.177
...who put on lordly airs and
dream of riches and sea empires.

00:27:13.427 --> 00:27:15.987
But there are also
good-looking shipwrights.

00:27:16.227 --> 00:27:19.185
What are you supposed to do
with a shipwright? Frame him?

00:27:21.987 --> 00:27:25.263
Neither captain, nor engineer,
nor boatswain. Never!

00:27:25.507 --> 00:27:26.064
- Orsa!
- Where?

00:27:26.307 --> 00:27:29.185
- Over there!
- Not a word about David.

00:27:29.427 --> 00:27:31.622
Only you lot know about it and
Katerina, the embroiderer...

00:27:31.907 --> 00:27:34.057
...who won't breathe a word.
- Your sister?

00:27:34.107 --> 00:27:37.304
She doesn't let me in on her secrets,
I don't let her in on mine.

00:27:37.507 --> 00:27:40.340
She's always hiding behind the tulle
of her mosquito net...

00:27:40.507 --> 00:27:42.145
...or talking to herself
under the jasmine.

00:27:42.187 --> 00:27:44.985
My, my what's the matter
with Daddy's pet?

00:27:45.227 --> 00:27:47.183
- Jealous again?
- I get so furious!

00:27:47.467 --> 00:27:49.981
In every one of his letters
he writes.

00:27:50.267 --> 00:27:53.577
"Don't let Orsa have her hair cut".
It's always Orsa this and Orsa that.

00:28:03.307 --> 00:28:04.979
<i>Spyros...</i>

00:28:07.067 --> 00:28:09.342
<i>... my dear boy.</i>

00:28:10.947 --> 00:28:15.498
<i>I don't have the heart
to upset you.</i>

00:28:17.587 --> 00:28:20.977
<i>But the news is not good.</i>

00:28:24.107 --> 00:28:27.224
<i>I failed to get
her mother to say "yes".</i>

00:28:30.387 --> 00:28:36.019
<i>Madame Mina is after wealth
and riches.</i>

00:28:38.507 --> 00:28:41.067
<i>Spyros, my lad...</i>

00:28:43.507 --> 00:28:48.376
<i>Her mother's reply was a curt "No".</i>

00:28:51.427 --> 00:28:55.306
<i>Our poverty is to blame.</i>

00:28:57.547 --> 00:29:02.462
<i>Clench your heart and don't let your
bitterness get the better of you.</i>

00:29:14.907 --> 00:29:16.704
Orsa!

00:29:17.147 --> 00:29:19.786
Did you see the Wassermann Test?
Stamped and certified.

00:29:19.987 --> 00:29:23.297
And he's ordered your bridal gown
from a Parisian fashion house!

00:29:23.547 --> 00:29:25.185
- He can give it to someone else!
- Generous! A gentleman.

00:29:25.227 --> 00:29:27.866
You're the lucky one and you don't
throw away such good fortune.

00:29:28.067 --> 00:29:29.386
When did you plan everything?

00:29:29.587 --> 00:29:31.100
First I investigated.
I thought of everything.

00:29:31.347 --> 00:29:32.826
- Except for one thing!
- What?

00:29:33.027 --> 00:29:34.540
Why did you say "yes"
without asking me?

00:29:34.827 --> 00:29:36.101
I know what I'm doing.

00:29:36.147 --> 00:29:38.217
What if I have feelings
for someone else?

00:29:38.507 --> 00:29:40.418
Do you?

00:29:45.387 --> 00:29:47.059
What am I to you?

00:29:49.107 --> 00:29:53.623
A field... to be sold
on St Savvas Day?

00:29:54.387 --> 00:29:57.220
It's all settled.
We're not going to lose face.

00:30:06.107 --> 00:30:08.143
You're hard...

00:30:10.307 --> 00:30:12.457
...as hard as stone.

00:30:23.307 --> 00:30:24.979
Come on, my boy.

00:30:28.307 --> 00:30:30.775
I'd watch her from a distance.

00:30:32.307 --> 00:30:34.025
She hesitated...

00:30:35.107 --> 00:30:38.656
- I thought she'd refuse because of...
- Hush!

00:30:41.307 --> 00:30:44.822
Here, here!
Here's where you should live.

00:30:45.987 --> 00:30:47.500
It will happen eventually.

00:30:48.587 --> 00:30:51.340
For now it's whatever Orsa wants.

00:30:51.707 --> 00:30:54.301
I'll wait on your lady all day.

00:30:54.667 --> 00:30:57.227
But at night I'll come back here.

00:30:57.267 --> 00:30:59.986
I want my own walls.

00:31:07.267 --> 00:31:08.859
Congratulations!

00:31:11.227 --> 00:31:14.458
May you live to a ripe old age,
healthy and in love!

00:31:16.707 --> 00:31:18.777
And to our little Moschoula's.

00:31:32.147 --> 00:31:34.058
What an aristocratic bridegroom!

00:31:45.467 --> 00:31:47.662
Hexadaktylou!
Start playing.

00:32:11.907 --> 00:32:14.546
David Bradley, English teacher.

00:33:18.827 --> 00:33:22.786
If only my son were here,
he would be so proud of you!

00:33:26.787 --> 00:33:29.221
Well, he's not here...

00:33:32.227 --> 00:33:33.945
Granny...

00:33:34.307 --> 00:33:36.377
Ah, the sea...

00:35:12.347 --> 00:35:17.182
<i>Andros, 27 December 1930.</i>

00:35:19.947 --> 00:35:22.825
<i>It's better you weren't here, Daddy.</i>

00:35:23.227 --> 00:35:26.185
<i>The island was covered with
a blanket of snow...</i>

00:35:26.947 --> 00:35:32.544
<i>... and it looked aristocratic and rare
like the postcards you sent us...</i>

00:35:34.147 --> 00:35:36.456
<i>... from frozen Archangel.</i>

00:35:51.147 --> 00:35:52.216
Congratulations!

00:35:52.507 --> 00:35:54.498
May it be your turn next, girls!

00:36:56.787 --> 00:36:59.585
It's much better for women...

00:37:01.307 --> 00:37:04.140
...not to marry the man they love...

00:37:07.707 --> 00:37:10.938
...because then when he starts
straying...

00:37:12.227 --> 00:37:17.506
...the pain won't be so great.

00:37:37.867 --> 00:37:40.461
Don't touch me tonight.

00:38:01.427 --> 00:38:04.544
May it be our turn soon, the seven
unmarried men aboard the ship.

00:38:06.347 --> 00:38:09.066
- From your sister's wedding?
- My godmother, Annezio, sent them.

00:38:09.267 --> 00:38:11.178
From the wedding of her master
Nikos Vatokouzis.

00:38:11.387 --> 00:38:13.947
- Who did he marry?
- Orsa Saltaferou.

00:38:14.347 --> 00:38:16.542
He's covered her with gold.

00:38:59.427 --> 00:39:02.544
You were going to walk around
the Maltabes Circle...

00:39:02.787 --> 00:39:04.379
Liar!

00:39:38.307 --> 00:39:40.537
An unlucky house...

00:39:43.227 --> 00:39:45.787
It brought sorrow...

00:39:47.947 --> 00:39:50.302
You'll banish it, Orsa.

00:39:51.827 --> 00:39:53.306
How?

00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:05.657
The old shadows persist...
I can feel them.

00:40:18.027 --> 00:40:23.021
She built the other house for us.
If I leave now she'll be furious.

00:40:25.427 --> 00:40:29.022
Maybe later, when Moscha
gets married too.

00:40:32.307 --> 00:40:34.901
You can't live without your Mama.

00:42:07.227 --> 00:42:11.140
<i>Saint Basil is on his way...</i>

00:42:11.547 --> 00:42:14.345
<i>... from Caesarea.</i>

00:42:14.787 --> 00:42:18.939
<i>Bearing incense and a candle...</i>

00:42:19.387 --> 00:42:22.902
<i>... paper and pen.</i>

00:42:23.067 --> 00:42:25.979
<i>The pen wrote and the paper...</i>

00:42:26.027 --> 00:42:28.143
Mina...

00:42:28.867 --> 00:42:32.746
...in China, in Japan,
in Manchuria...

00:42:33.307 --> 00:42:36.777
...we have revolutions.

00:42:38.267 --> 00:42:40.542
The ports there are dangerous.

00:42:42.307 --> 00:42:46.744
Your Savvas himself requested it both
from my son in London and myself.

00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:52.346
He wants to work only in the Atlantic
a quiet trade, you know...

00:42:53.787 --> 00:42:57.939
Curacao, Paramaribo, Necochea,
Suerte and back.

00:43:00.827 --> 00:43:03.295
My late husband taught me well.

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:07.426
Even admitted
I was sharper than him.

00:43:10.667 --> 00:43:15.457
- So, Savvas...
- I'm here about Moscha.

00:43:16.107 --> 00:43:17.506
Moscha?

00:43:27.307 --> 00:43:29.298
- David.
- David.

00:43:31.227 --> 00:43:34.060
I found it in the hatbox
where she keeps her combs.

00:43:34.627 --> 00:43:39.257
<i>Good evening to you my lords,
here to celebrate...</i>

00:43:39.307 --> 00:43:44.461
I brought him here as an act of
charity for the seamen's children.

00:43:44.907 --> 00:43:47.023
So that they learn fluent English.

00:43:47.307 --> 00:43:52.700
And he is penniless...

00:43:54.507 --> 00:43:56.577
...hungry...

00:43:57.067 --> 00:44:00.980
...with sickly ribs you can see
through his shirt.

00:44:02.547 --> 00:44:07.541
He's someone who paints bulls,
graves, carcasses...

00:44:09.227 --> 00:44:11.058
...the wounded seal...

00:44:11.907 --> 00:44:16.139
...who tries to turn the heads
of silly schoolgirls, the pervert!

00:44:18.307 --> 00:44:21.265
Who dares to look
at the women here!

00:44:21.587 --> 00:44:23.464
- David?
- David.

00:44:26.187 --> 00:44:29.065
You have the means.
Send him packing.

00:44:35.427 --> 00:44:39.466
- I'll bring another Englishman.
- Bring an Englishwoman.

00:44:46.387 --> 00:44:48.264
See that you find her a husband.

00:44:50.307 --> 00:44:52.821
You sent him away! You!

00:44:54.427 --> 00:44:56.497
I did what I had to do.

00:44:57.267 --> 00:45:01.180
You didn't think I was going to let
you starve with him in the fog.

00:45:01.507 --> 00:45:03.737
Haven't you ever been in love?

00:45:04.267 --> 00:45:06.337
Is that what you think?

00:45:09.107 --> 00:45:13.419
Well I've been hurt too.
I've been hurt and I know.

00:45:13.747 --> 00:45:15.544
That's the way life is.

00:45:15.787 --> 00:45:19.223
Love doesn't last long
but the pain it brings does...

00:45:20.907 --> 00:45:22.898
At least give me back
his photograph.

00:45:23.187 --> 00:45:26.099
You think I have it? What would I do
with it? Look at his stupid face...

00:45:26.347 --> 00:45:27.666
The penniless, starving
good-for-nothing!

00:45:27.907 --> 00:45:29.056
You stole it!

00:45:29.267 --> 00:45:31.303
<i>It's all your fault!</i>

00:45:32.587 --> 00:45:34.896
<i>It's London you wanted so badly...</i>

00:45:35.827 --> 00:45:38.500
<i>Mama, I hate you!</i>

00:45:38.827 --> 00:45:42.103
<i>I don't want your house or you.
I'm getting out of here.</i>

00:45:42.387 --> 00:45:44.059
Poor Moscha...

00:45:44.307 --> 00:45:45.183
<i>You're heartless!</i>

00:45:46.787 --> 00:45:48.425
Insensitive!

00:45:49.427 --> 00:45:50.223
A viper!

00:46:18.947 --> 00:46:21.063
From our offices in Piraeus.

00:46:23.107 --> 00:46:24.256
A charter-party?

00:46:26.067 --> 00:46:27.022
A boy.

00:46:33.027 --> 00:46:35.495
Congratulations, Captain Nikos.

00:46:38.547 --> 00:46:41.220
Congratulations, Captain Nikos.
We'll be drinking beer today.

00:46:42.187 --> 00:46:43.825
Congratulations.

00:47:04.507 --> 00:47:08.420
Iron deficiency due to breast-
feeding anorexia, insomnia.

00:47:08.827 --> 00:47:13.059
These things happen, but you did
well to bring her to Athens.

00:47:13.107 --> 00:47:15.905
We have more means at our disposal.

00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:19.100
In a month our fair lady
will be as right as rain.

00:47:23.227 --> 00:47:25.741
<i>Creams and rice puddings.
Delivery.</i>

00:47:29.307 --> 00:47:31.025
Stefanos got a car.

00:47:31.307 --> 00:47:34.060
<i>As soon as he got his driver's
license, he bought a car.</i>

00:47:34.107 --> 00:47:36.382
<i>You look just fine, Philip...</i>

00:47:36.747 --> 00:47:38.863
<i>Next week he's taking us
all to Phaliron.</i>

00:47:39.107 --> 00:47:40.096
I'm sorry.

00:47:42.347 --> 00:47:45.066
For five whole months
she breastfed the baby...

00:47:45.107 --> 00:47:48.543
...and she fainted while rubbing
her heels with a pumice stone.

00:47:52.347 --> 00:47:54.542
<i>Please collect the thermometers.</i>

00:47:56.147 --> 00:47:58.661
Our baby's in good hands.

00:47:59.027 --> 00:48:03.225
Moscha is crazy about our young
Savvas. She writes us every day.

00:48:03.507 --> 00:48:06.260
What she fed him, where
she took him for a walk...

00:48:06.507 --> 00:48:08.179
...what she sang to him.
You get the photographs.

00:48:15.507 --> 00:48:16.701
I'm sorry.

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:22.217
I'm the one who's sorry.

00:48:24.347 --> 00:48:28.306
I've just come for the day.
I can't escort you to Andros.

00:48:30.947 --> 00:48:34.064
Problems. Damage to a ship's
structure under the waterline.

00:48:34.307 --> 00:48:36.218
But I won't bother you
with such things.

00:48:40.107 --> 00:48:43.463
Let's see when I'll be able to hold
our son tightly in my arms.

00:48:54.467 --> 00:48:56.139
<i>I've missed Andros.</i>

00:48:57.147 --> 00:49:01.425
<i>I miss my son like crazy,
and the island.</i>

00:49:18.787 --> 00:49:23.383
<i>Welcome to our Andros!
Get your luggage and make room...</i>

00:49:23.787 --> 00:49:26.426
<i>... to those who are getting ready
to depart.</i>

00:49:26.747 --> 00:49:31.059
<i>People of Andros, get your
ticket and bon voyage!</i>

00:49:51.427 --> 00:49:57.582
My love, my Savvas, my child!
My beauty!

00:49:58.467 --> 00:50:00.025
Everything will be alright...

00:50:00.067 --> 00:50:02.262
Where's your Daddy, Savvas?

00:50:03.387 --> 00:50:05.855
Where's your Daddy, sweetheart?

00:50:06.107 --> 00:50:09.224
You're all right. You're fine.
You have your color back.

00:50:10.427 --> 00:50:13.783
May you always be in the best
of health, Mrs. Vatokouzi.

00:50:14.547 --> 00:50:16.936
- Where's Moscha?
- They're coming.

00:50:18.587 --> 00:50:20.066
Who's coming?

00:50:20.107 --> 00:50:22.701
Moscha and her fiancé.

00:50:22.987 --> 00:50:26.059
Her fiancé?
When did she get engaged?

00:50:26.107 --> 00:50:28.860
The day before yesterday. We had
no time to write to you about it.

00:50:29.107 --> 00:50:31.416
- Who's she engaged to?
- A captain.

00:50:33.027 --> 00:50:38.465
<i>The ship for Tinos, Syros, Piraeus
sails in an hour! Hurry!</i>

00:50:41.827 --> 00:50:42.976
Orsa!

00:51:13.227 --> 00:51:15.218
My ring...

00:51:20.587 --> 00:51:22.942
He asked for my hand ten days ago.

00:51:23.307 --> 00:51:27.095
"I'm a captain now and I make
that much", he told the shrew.

00:51:27.147 --> 00:51:32.221
The Hadoulideses gave him
a 15% share in a new steamship.

00:51:32.267 --> 00:51:35.304
Because it seems he saved some
expensive cargo for them...

00:51:35.507 --> 00:51:36.656
...from tornadoes...

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:41.220
He put almost two kilos
of gold earrings and bracelets...

00:51:41.507 --> 00:51:44.305
...on the table in front of her.
For little Moscha, he said.

00:51:44.547 --> 00:51:47.380
- In other words, for me.
- I know you're little Moscha.

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:52.145
What did Mama say?

00:51:53.067 --> 00:51:55.137
Did she say yes right away?

00:51:57.227 --> 00:51:58.501
Of course.

00:52:00.507 --> 00:52:04.261
She was scared I might elope
with some foreigner, you see.

00:52:07.587 --> 00:52:13.184
Orsa, with Spyros, I forgot that
dreadful Englishman in no time!

00:52:13.587 --> 00:52:17.262
Erased him from memory.

00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:22.545
Taking off without even
a "goodbye little Moscha"!

00:52:23.267 --> 00:52:27.658
Did he send Emilios
to arrange the match?

00:52:27.947 --> 00:52:30.017
Spyros himself came!

00:52:36.347 --> 00:52:38.144
In other words... he loves you?

00:52:38.507 --> 00:52:39.417
What else?

00:52:40.427 --> 00:52:43.658
- Do you love him too?
- He deserves to be loved!

00:52:45.667 --> 00:52:47.578
Isn't he gorgeous?

00:52:48.027 --> 00:52:51.303
Have you noticed his eyes?
They sparkle so!

00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:55.342
All the girls are jealous of me.
They even came up with some lyrics.

00:52:55.587 --> 00:52:59.660
Moscha, little Moscha, a thousand
beauty marks on your back so white...

00:52:59.867 --> 00:53:03.303
...for Maltabes to kiss all night.

00:53:04.107 --> 00:53:06.257
And my God...

00:53:06.947 --> 00:53:09.063
...how he kisses!

00:53:16.707 --> 00:53:18.459
Orsa...

00:53:24.387 --> 00:53:27.379
You love Nikos, right?

00:53:27.707 --> 00:53:29.663
He's a good man.

00:53:30.147 --> 00:53:35.301
That's not what I asked.
I asked if you love him.

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.626
He's my husband.

00:53:39.027 --> 00:53:42.940
With the most amazing hands
in the world!

00:53:43.187 --> 00:53:44.620
Can't stop looking at them...

00:53:44.827 --> 00:53:47.387
Large and small veins
like rivers and streams...

00:53:47.667 --> 00:53:51.216
Like a map of... Rio de la Plata!

00:53:51.627 --> 00:53:54.061
- My brother-in-law, after Spyros...
- Moscha!

00:53:55.107 --> 00:53:57.177
We're late.

00:53:57.547 --> 00:54:00.015
We're off to book the dulcimer
and lute players.

00:54:00.347 --> 00:54:01.541
I'm getting married.

00:55:01.747 --> 00:55:05.057
Moscha and the scent of cinnamon.
A girl fit for a King!

00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:06.826
Little Moscha!

00:55:41.147 --> 00:55:42.660
Your health, Moscha.

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.663
Long live the bride and groom.

00:56:28.987 --> 00:56:30.579
A solid marriage.

00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:34.820
Come on, Captain.

00:56:40.347 --> 00:56:42.338
Congratulations. Congratulations!

00:56:46.307 --> 00:56:47.820
May you have fine offspring!

00:56:48.147 --> 00:56:49.978
Next dance, let's go!

00:56:50.027 --> 00:56:52.336
Captain's wives, my daughters!

00:57:05.667 --> 00:57:08.022
- And dessert.
- Lovely! May your turn be next.

00:57:08.267 --> 00:57:09.859
Thank you very much.

00:57:10.107 --> 00:57:11.426
Yours too, sweetie.

00:57:15.187 --> 00:57:17.655
Come on, Uncle Emilios, cheer up!

00:57:22.307 --> 00:57:23.786
For your little Moscha.

00:57:34.027 --> 00:57:37.815
I had eleven dances with him.
And you, not a single one.

00:57:38.067 --> 00:57:40.137
What will he think? You're acting
as though you can't stand him.

00:57:40.387 --> 00:57:41.137
- Me?
- No, me!

00:58:31.587 --> 00:58:33.066
<i>My little Moscha!</i>

00:58:33.467 --> 00:58:35.378
<i>Aye aye, Captain.</i>

00:58:42.427 --> 00:58:43.940
<i>You're drunk, eh?</i>

00:58:44.147 --> 00:58:46.263
<i>Your kisses made me drunk.</i>

00:58:46.547 --> 00:58:49.380
<i>I want more and more
until the morning.</i>

00:58:53.027 --> 00:58:56.144
<i>No! Leave the windows open!</i>

00:58:58.587 --> 00:59:02.546
<i>For as long as I'm here,
I want to breathe in the Aegean.</i>

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:21.575
Single plank flooring.
24 single cypress boards...

00:59:21.827 --> 00:59:25.137
...no mud between them to drown
out the sound of footsteps...

00:59:25.387 --> 00:59:27.855
...and the noise
of everyday housework.

00:59:28.227 --> 00:59:31.378
Your mother spent money
on fancy doorknobs, fancy tiles...

00:59:31.747 --> 00:59:35.023
...fancy balcony railings,
but scrimped on the ceiling.

00:59:35.307 --> 00:59:37.218
Let's fix it.

00:59:38.267 --> 00:59:42.055
Now that we can afford it,
Mr. Halas.

00:59:42.427 --> 00:59:44.987
But how? Tear up the whole house?

00:59:45.347 --> 00:59:47.542
No matter how much you pay me...

00:59:47.867 --> 00:59:51.416
...single boards don't become
double boards.

01:00:48.267 --> 01:00:52.419
Good-for-nothing carpenter.
Murderer...

01:00:59.467 --> 01:01:05.064
In Andros mattresses are only
dented on one side... the woman's.

01:01:06.147 --> 01:01:08.342
They come and go like visitors.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:13.417
When Artemis comes it's as though
my whole schedule is disrupted.

01:01:13.467 --> 01:01:16.425
The children are very shy with him.

01:01:17.067 --> 01:01:20.537
He's a stranger in his own house.

01:01:21.107 --> 01:01:26.306
Say, Mina. It looks as if Savvas has
forgotten the way back to Andros...

01:01:26.347 --> 01:01:29.259
Something, something
must have happened.

01:01:30.427 --> 01:01:33.385
What happened is that
which happens to all of us.

01:01:34.707 --> 01:01:36.538
Married almost 30 years...

01:01:36.947 --> 01:01:39.984
...and I still haven't worn out
a pair of sheets with him.

01:01:41.307 --> 01:01:44.538
Your daughters, your grandson...
they are all well?

01:01:44.827 --> 01:01:47.136
Moscha will be giving birth
any time now.

01:01:47.507 --> 01:01:49.179
And your sons-in-law,
they are well too?

01:01:49.227 --> 01:01:51.457
One left, the other's coming.

01:01:52.787 --> 01:01:54.505
Hello Savvas.

01:01:56.307 --> 01:01:57.057
Look...

01:01:59.427 --> 01:02:01.463
Savvas, it's your Daddy!

01:02:03.707 --> 01:02:06.221
It's your Daddy!
It's true!

01:02:07.387 --> 01:02:09.537
Wind it up.

01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:14.223
Can you wind it up?
Shall I show you how?

01:02:14.427 --> 01:02:15.143
Go away!

01:02:15.347 --> 01:02:17.144
- Savvas!
- Take it easy.

01:02:20.027 --> 01:02:22.336
Shall I give you a kiss?

01:02:23.027 --> 01:02:25.416
Will you give me a kiss
now I showed you?

01:03:05.067 --> 01:03:07.297
It was washed up by the sea.

01:03:10.267 --> 01:03:12.622
You're the gift of my life.

01:03:42.947 --> 01:03:47.020
How about it? Shall we move?

01:03:49.747 --> 01:03:53.057
You must have gotten over
your old fear by now...

01:03:56.147 --> 01:03:58.217
Why not your mother here...

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:01.584
...and we move to the other house?
We'll be by ourselves.

01:04:05.947 --> 01:04:09.178
Not by ourselves... by myself...

01:04:13.147 --> 01:04:15.058
...in those rooms...

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:18.620
...by myself.

01:04:21.827 --> 01:04:24.295
Between those walls that...

01:04:37.187 --> 01:04:39.257
...by myself...

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:45.463
...since you men are always away.

01:04:54.347 --> 01:04:59.819
<i>Yokohama, Japan, 12 March 1937.</i>

01:05:01.227 --> 01:05:03.582
<i>My dearest Moscha.</i>

01:05:04.107 --> 01:05:07.656
<i>Our household is constantly
on my mind. Are you all well?</i>

01:05:08.707 --> 01:05:10.777
<i>Before I open each one
of your letters...</i>

01:05:11.067 --> 01:05:13.137
<i>... just to be on the safe side,
I make the sign of the cross.</i>

01:05:13.187 --> 01:05:17.339
<i>I hope both you and your sister
loved the exotic kimonos.</i>

01:05:22.227 --> 01:05:24.297
I don't think Spyros...

01:05:25.627 --> 01:05:28.187
...cheats on me
with Japanese women.

01:05:28.387 --> 01:05:31.220
With Polish women, Englishwomen.
I rule it out.

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:36.343
When he comes home he has such
longing for a female body... for me.

01:05:39.427 --> 01:05:43.181
He undresses me and takes me in his
arms and kisses me and squeezes me...

01:05:43.587 --> 01:05:48.945
...on the lips, my breasts,
my legs... with such passion...

01:05:51.187 --> 01:05:53.178
...such passion.

01:05:54.107 --> 01:05:56.143
He can't get enough of me.

01:06:07.987 --> 01:06:09.102
It's freezing!

01:06:23.387 --> 01:06:25.503
You're burning up with fever.

01:07:21.867 --> 01:07:25.303
Spyros and Moscha, Miltos-Marie.

01:07:26.027 --> 01:07:29.303
Louis-Katina, Giannis-Kiki.

01:07:30.147 --> 01:07:32.183
From my tangerine tree.

01:07:38.227 --> 01:07:40.024
It's their photographs we married.

01:07:40.307 --> 01:07:43.777
And they, ours.
Time goes by with photographs.

01:07:45.467 --> 01:07:50.587
1932, a memento from the christening
of Savvas junior.

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:56.295
1934, our Christina in the baptismal
font at the church of Aghios Giorgis.

01:07:57.347 --> 01:07:59.224
1934...

01:07:59.267 --> 01:08:05.456
...a memento naturally from the
1st birthday of your niece Mersina.

01:08:06.387 --> 01:08:09.060
A letter dated the day
before yesterday.

01:08:09.267 --> 01:08:12.100
"My dearest Spyros, our Christina.

01:08:13.347 --> 01:08:15.941
A little doll with her doll.

01:08:16.387 --> 01:08:21.063
Our daughter adores unripe damsons
and, like you, meatballs..."

01:08:23.267 --> 01:08:25.576
But how would he know about it?

01:08:44.827 --> 01:08:50.459
<i>Today you say goodbye to me
and to Argentina.</i>

01:08:59.267 --> 01:09:00.666
<i>That was it...</i>

01:09:04.427 --> 01:09:06.895
<i>I entered like a thief...</i>

01:09:07.227 --> 01:09:08.137
<i>... for two hours...</i>

01:09:10.187 --> 01:09:11.700
<i>... that was it...</i>

01:09:22.067 --> 01:09:25.423
<i>So that the child remembers them.</i>

01:09:30.987 --> 01:09:34.582
<i>He's riding round the port
on his bicycle.</i>

01:09:35.107 --> 01:09:38.019
He didn't want you to kiss him
for the last time.

01:09:38.067 --> 01:09:40.376
That's life Angelita.

01:09:43.507 --> 01:09:47.546
- That's life.
- That's life. I understand.

01:09:48.827 --> 01:09:50.818
<i>You must go back home.</i>

01:09:51.027 --> 01:09:52.460
<i>I must.</i>

01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:55.779
<i>It looks as if war will break out.</i>

01:09:57.147 --> 01:10:00.378
<i>Your shirts. Your things.</i>

01:10:00.987 --> 01:10:03.376
<i>Everything you had in the house.</i>

01:10:08.027 --> 01:10:10.860
<i>Now that they saw me on the ship...</i>

01:10:11.107 --> 01:10:14.224
<i>... tongues will wag anyway...</i>

01:10:18.427 --> 01:10:20.418
<i>I want you to stay here.</i>

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:22.623
<i>I want to leave alone...</i>

01:10:22.947 --> 01:10:26.906
<i>... and count the steps
as I go down...</i>

01:10:30.187 --> 01:10:31.586
<i>Angelita...</i>

01:10:43.187 --> 01:10:44.540
<i>The keys.</i>

01:10:48.467 --> 01:10:50.423
<i>You're not coming back.</i>

01:10:51.307 --> 01:10:54.504
<i>You're not coming back
to our house.</i>

01:10:57.067 --> 01:10:59.456
<i>It's yours.</i>

01:11:00.067 --> 01:11:01.898
<i>The house is yours.</i>

01:11:04.547 --> 01:11:06.139
<i>The deed.</i>

01:11:07.307 --> 01:11:11.061
<i>They brought it to me
late yesterday.</i>

01:11:20.907 --> 01:11:24.377
<i>You've also grown old
with me, my dear.</i>

01:11:25.547 --> 01:11:27.344
It was nice.

01:11:34.107 --> 01:11:35.586
It was nice.

01:12:02.307 --> 01:12:03.786
Turn up the volume!

01:12:04.147 --> 01:12:05.944
So the people opposite
can hear too!

01:12:12.907 --> 01:12:14.226
Orsa!

01:12:15.427 --> 01:12:17.224
Come upstairs quickly!
Spyros is here!

01:12:20.107 --> 01:12:22.223
My little Christina!

01:12:31.707 --> 01:12:33.618
The money's adding up.

01:12:36.147 --> 01:12:37.705
For the big step.

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.539
What sort of step?

01:12:44.307 --> 01:12:46.184
Step by step with my girlfriends.

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:50.222
The bountiful seas!

01:12:52.227 --> 01:12:56.505
You mean a house in Athens?
In Piraeus?

01:13:13.147 --> 01:13:14.785
Hello, sister-in-law.

01:13:21.427 --> 01:13:22.701
It's 10 o'clock.

01:13:23.467 --> 01:13:26.140
Time for bed!
That's all I care about.

01:13:32.387 --> 01:13:34.059
Will you stop it!

01:13:36.387 --> 01:13:38.264
Go to bed!

01:13:38.307 --> 01:13:39.786
At once!

01:13:47.107 --> 01:13:49.098
That's more like it.

01:14:16.427 --> 01:14:17.655
<i>Andros, with your jasmine...</i>

01:14:17.907 --> 01:14:19.784
<i>... I wouldn't change you
for anything.</i>

01:14:20.027 --> 01:14:23.258
<i>Yes, but you'll be leaving again.
You like the high seas, Captain.</i>

01:14:30.547 --> 01:14:32.503
Your words.

01:15:10.627 --> 01:15:12.185
<i>A fire in red...</i>

01:15:12.227 --> 01:15:14.218
A fire in red!

01:15:14.667 --> 01:15:16.339
<i>A fire in red!</i>

01:15:20.947 --> 01:15:23.222
A fire in red.

01:15:24.347 --> 01:15:26.736
<i>I had it sewn for you...
for you...</i>

01:15:27.507 --> 01:15:29.020
<i>I had it sewn for you.</i>

01:15:29.347 --> 01:15:31.303
I had it sewn for you.

01:16:11.747 --> 01:16:13.783
I stay awake all night
and I don't breathe.

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:16.296
I stay awake all night
and I don't breathe...

01:16:39.307 --> 01:16:41.184
<i>My girl! My girl!</i>

01:16:41.427 --> 01:16:43.179
<i>Wipe her forehead. She's
drenched in perspiration.</i>

01:16:43.227 --> 01:16:45.058
<i>Push, Orsa, sweetheart.
Come on, be patient.</i>

01:16:45.307 --> 01:16:47.423
<i>The water's ready.
I'm going to boil some more.</i>

01:16:47.707 --> 01:16:49.937
<i>- Midwife, give us a hand.
- Annezio, boil the cloths.</i>

01:16:50.267 --> 01:16:53.816
<i>Mersina, go to your godmother.
Christina! Go play with her.</i>

01:16:54.227 --> 01:16:55.421
<i>I need four towels.</i>

01:16:55.707 --> 01:16:57.459
<i>The water's ready.
I'm boiling more.</i>

01:16:59.067 --> 01:17:01.535
<i>Come on, Orsa! You've done
this before, my girl.</i>

01:17:01.787 --> 01:17:03.664
<i>Wipe her brow. She's sweating.</i>

01:17:03.947 --> 01:17:05.983
<i>Come on, girl.
You've had another two.</i>

01:17:06.267 --> 01:17:07.746
<i>Push, sweetheart. Push!</i>

01:17:07.987 --> 01:17:10.865
<i>Everything will be all right.</i>

01:17:11.187 --> 01:17:13.143
<i>Squeeze my hand.
As much as you like.</i>

01:17:13.387 --> 01:17:14.706
<i>The Virgin Mary is with us.</i>

01:17:14.947 --> 01:17:16.539
<i>With pain. With pain!</i>

01:17:16.787 --> 01:17:19.062
<i>What is it, baby?
What is it? A girl!</i>

01:17:19.467 --> 01:17:21.776
<i>A girl. Another girl!</i>

01:17:22.787 --> 01:17:25.699
<i>A little girl. A little girl.</i>

01:17:26.027 --> 01:17:28.985
<i>The good mother's child
is a girl!</i>

01:17:29.027 --> 01:17:32.463
<i>Well done, little Orsa!</i>

01:18:00.227 --> 01:18:03.583
<i>Spyros, send Nikos a telegram
with the good news!</i>

01:18:11.747 --> 01:18:16.775
<i>Nikos, dear Orsa
has borne a daughter.</i>

01:18:18.867 --> 01:18:22.064
<i>Mother and child
are in the best of health.</i>

01:18:23.907 --> 01:18:25.818
<i>Heartfelt congratulations.</i>

01:18:31.067 --> 01:18:34.264
<i>Nikos, congratulations
on the birth of your daughter.</i>

01:18:34.587 --> 01:18:36.066
<i>Mother and child are well.</i>

01:18:37.267 --> 01:18:40.065
<i>You've become a father
for the third time.</i>

01:18:40.427 --> 01:18:42.577
<i>I envy you.</i>

01:18:48.547 --> 01:18:51.459
<i>Nikos, beautiful little Orsa
has had a third child.</i>

01:18:52.387 --> 01:18:55.299
<i>Her eyes like black pearls.</i>

01:18:55.707 --> 01:19:00.178
<i>And her hair, which was not
been cut since her schooldays...</i>

01:19:00.547 --> 01:19:04.142
<i>... flows in waves
over the entire double bed.</i>

01:19:18.147 --> 01:19:23.744
<i>Is the prize for fidelity
worth a single penny, I wonder?</i>

01:19:27.507 --> 01:19:29.065
<i>All these years...</i>

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:35.145
<i>All these years alone
and faithful...</i>

01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:38.742
<i>What's the prize?</i>

01:19:41.027 --> 01:19:43.177
<i>What?</i>

01:19:43.587 --> 01:19:45.225
<i>Ah, Mina, Mina...</i>

01:19:55.227 --> 01:19:57.263
A whole bunch of grandchildren!

01:20:20.027 --> 01:20:22.097
Woman!

01:20:28.747 --> 01:20:30.738
I'm back to Andros.

01:21:07.227 --> 01:21:08.865
They're here at last!

01:21:30.067 --> 01:21:31.864
Nothing more.

01:21:32.267 --> 01:21:37.057
Britain and France
have declared war on Germany.

01:21:40.267 --> 01:21:42.542
Your husband arrived just in time,
Mina.

01:21:42.747 --> 01:21:44.817
He's lucky he managed...

01:21:49.147 --> 01:21:53.345
<i>How did Mrs. Hadoulaina put it?
England... what exactly did she say?</i>

01:21:54.147 --> 01:21:57.378
Captain Savvas, here's your
other son-in-law, Spyros.

01:21:58.867 --> 01:22:00.539
Good to see you.

01:22:02.387 --> 01:22:04.298
And yet, you're late...

01:22:06.147 --> 01:22:08.422
You're too late.

01:22:16.587 --> 01:22:19.021
Your mug.
It's been waiting for you.

01:22:30.467 --> 01:22:33.300
You've settled in nicely on
dry land son, isn't that so?

01:22:36.347 --> 01:22:39.498
And you must be proud
of the house Mina built.

01:22:44.547 --> 01:22:47.015
The agony of separation is over.

01:22:50.227 --> 01:22:53.378
Be mindful... even now.

01:22:58.107 --> 01:23:01.986
The two Orsas in my life,
my mother and my daughter...

01:23:03.027 --> 01:23:04.824
...they make the best coffee.

01:23:07.267 --> 01:23:09.906
It's the loneliness that calls
for a pot of coffee.

01:23:11.587 --> 01:23:13.066
The loneliness...

01:23:45.267 --> 01:23:46.825
I want us to live here.

01:23:54.907 --> 01:23:58.343
I thought you brought me here
to pick up some things.

01:23:59.267 --> 01:24:01.337
For Christ's sake,
I don't understand you, Orsa.

01:24:01.667 --> 01:24:03.339
Weren't you the one who said...

01:24:03.587 --> 01:24:05.066
...the walls were steeped
in my father's madness...

01:24:05.107 --> 01:24:07.098
...and my mother's tears?

01:24:08.027 --> 01:24:09.938
And you said that I...

01:24:13.227 --> 01:24:16.185
...that I would breathe new life
into the rooms...

01:24:16.387 --> 01:24:19.424
I begged you, Orsa. I begged
and begged but you insisted...

01:24:19.627 --> 01:24:22.016
...that you want the cousins
to be together.

01:24:22.067 --> 01:24:24.297
That you want to be
near your sister.

01:24:24.507 --> 01:24:25.496
I'll have Annezio.

01:24:25.707 --> 01:24:27.379
She's over 70.

01:24:29.627 --> 01:24:31.106
What's going on?

01:24:38.267 --> 01:24:41.384
I feel that we should.
That it's necessary.

01:24:44.187 --> 01:24:47.224
That the time has come
for us to move here.

01:24:47.587 --> 01:24:50.226
You thought about it too late,
Orsa.

01:24:50.587 --> 01:24:54.978
Now families, women
have to stay together.

01:24:57.027 --> 01:25:02.181
<i>In retaliation for the sinking of
the HOOD and the loss of 1,300 men...</i>

01:25:02.587 --> 01:25:07.024
<i>... British naval forces
in the Atlantic...</i>

01:25:07.467 --> 01:25:13.099
<i>... have hunted down and sunk
the BISMARCK...</i>

01:25:13.387 --> 01:25:17.505
<i>... sending a thousand Germans
to a watery grave.</i>

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:23.416
They'll bomb fuel tanks,
docks, customs houses...

01:25:24.427 --> 01:25:26.145
They'll target the ports first.

01:25:27.467 --> 01:25:30.220
The SS KYMOTHOE
is sailing for Marseille.

01:25:30.467 --> 01:25:32.344
And the SS ARCHIPELAGOS
for Konstanz.

01:25:32.387 --> 01:25:35.584
20 years after the Great War
and we're at it again.

01:25:36.427 --> 01:25:39.066
Since I was 13...
50 years at sea...

01:25:40.067 --> 01:25:42.820
And now you're leaving and
I'm staying here on the rock...

01:25:43.147 --> 01:25:45.786
...like an old crab
with its claws broken...

01:25:46.147 --> 01:25:49.344
You'll look out for the women.
And the children.

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.340
See you tonight.

01:26:09.627 --> 01:26:11.026
So long.

01:26:11.067 --> 01:26:13.103
Take care.

01:26:16.667 --> 01:26:20.103
It's been 20 years since our
NAUTILUS was sunk...

01:26:20.147 --> 01:26:22.263
...with all hands on board.

01:26:22.587 --> 01:26:27.058
And I still remember that night
going from village to village...

01:26:27.387 --> 01:26:30.379
...alone on my mule
to notify the families.

01:26:32.027 --> 01:26:36.179
I'm haunted by that night. I don't
want to go through that again.

01:26:39.187 --> 01:26:41.303
Do I have the five?

01:26:41.987 --> 01:26:44.137
From the Korthian villages?

01:26:44.547 --> 01:26:46.026
Those poor boys?

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:50.345
Their seaman's books are ready.
All five are signing on.

01:27:00.547 --> 01:27:03.107
I knew their fathers well...

01:27:04.347 --> 01:27:06.542
And I've checked out the sons...

01:27:12.067 --> 01:27:13.295
Thank you.

01:27:19.547 --> 01:27:20.775
Spyros...

01:27:21.947 --> 01:27:25.098
Take Orsa and go home.

01:27:25.587 --> 01:27:29.466
I'm popping over to the doctor
for a cough syrup to have in stock...

01:27:29.787 --> 01:27:31.015
...and I'm coming.

01:28:46.307 --> 01:28:47.786
Good evening.

01:28:55.347 --> 01:28:57.577
The Maltabes Clan.

01:28:58.747 --> 01:29:00.624
"Little England".

01:29:04.827 --> 01:29:06.579
"Little England".

01:29:07.187 --> 01:29:12.136
I've loaded copper in Valparaiso
and am heading for Buenos Aires.

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:14.219
We get there, unload...

01:29:14.267 --> 01:29:19.261
...and to thank the crew, I take them
all to a club, the La Paloma.

01:29:19.307 --> 01:29:21.377
I've heard about it.

01:29:21.627 --> 01:29:25.905
Don't be cross with us! It's my knee.
That's why we're late.

01:29:26.267 --> 01:29:28.940
- Hope you're better soon, Nana.
- It's been swollen for ten days.

01:29:30.467 --> 01:29:33.220
There are 1317 postcards
in my collection.

01:29:33.467 --> 01:29:35.378
The only country I don't have
a postcard from is Albania.

01:29:35.627 --> 01:29:38.346
I don't even know what it's like...
And tomorrow so many young men...

01:29:38.627 --> 01:29:41.505
...who were my pupils
will be going to fight there.

01:29:41.827 --> 01:29:44.625
Why is Spyros so late?
He left the office hours ago.

01:29:44.907 --> 01:29:47.216
- Right after the signatures.
- What signatures?

01:29:47.587 --> 01:29:48.781
Here he is.

01:29:49.027 --> 01:29:50.255
Good evening.

01:29:50.467 --> 01:29:52.025
There you are! Where were you?

01:29:52.347 --> 01:29:54.099
I had to say goodbye
to a lot of people...

01:29:54.507 --> 01:29:56.623
- How are you, Katerina?
- I'm fine, Spyros.

01:30:19.267 --> 01:30:21.303
Our LITTLE ENGLAND.

01:30:22.347 --> 01:30:25.544
LITTLE ENGLAND?
Strange name for a ship.

01:30:26.347 --> 01:30:30.260
No doubt it was little Moscha's idea.
She's so fluent in English.

01:30:30.587 --> 01:30:31.337
Definitely!

01:30:31.627 --> 01:30:37.224
Registered tonnage 4,978, cargo...

01:30:37.467 --> 01:30:39.503
...tonnage 7500.

01:30:39.787 --> 01:30:42.699
Price 92,000 pounds.

01:30:43.067 --> 01:30:43.977
Bravo!

01:30:44.027 --> 01:30:46.063
Congratulations!

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:48.059
Spyros Maltabes,
mission accomplished.

01:30:48.307 --> 01:30:49.217
You are now a ship owner.

01:30:52.387 --> 01:30:55.777
Ammonia, nitrate, naphthalene...

01:30:56.147 --> 01:30:58.615
...varnishes and tar.

01:31:00.227 --> 01:31:03.139
I took on all the dangerous cargo.

01:31:03.387 --> 01:31:07.266
I worked... like a dog.

01:31:07.547 --> 01:31:09.185
Mines and torpedoes everywhere.

01:31:09.387 --> 01:31:12.026
You picked the time to invest
all your savings on shipboards.

01:31:12.187 --> 01:31:14.462
I've been waiting for it
for 10 years.

01:31:18.547 --> 01:31:20.697
I dreamed about it.

01:31:22.827 --> 01:31:24.385
You're completely mad!

01:31:24.747 --> 01:31:26.783
Congratulations.
May she be seaworthy.

01:31:27.027 --> 01:31:31.020
Our madman has guts.
That's common knowledge.

01:31:31.787 --> 01:31:35.063
Be careful you don't get caught
up in the injustice of war.

01:31:35.267 --> 01:31:36.382
That's my business.

01:31:38.387 --> 01:31:42.062
The injustice of war rings out
in my ears... in yours...

01:31:45.587 --> 01:31:49.421
And there are other injustices
that weigh down my soul.

01:31:57.107 --> 01:31:58.460
Godspeed...

01:31:58.747 --> 01:32:00.100
And a safe return.

01:32:00.387 --> 01:32:01.297
For everyone.

01:32:01.547 --> 01:32:02.024
Amen!

01:32:02.467 --> 01:32:03.900
Cheers!

01:32:04.467 --> 01:32:05.456
Cheers!

01:32:05.827 --> 01:32:07.101
Amen!

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:09.103
It's the first time...

01:32:09.467 --> 01:32:13.176
...that the three captains of the
house are on the island together...

01:32:13.467 --> 01:32:16.743
...and sitting at the same table,
mother.

01:32:17.067 --> 01:32:20.025
The first time in so many years.

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:21.864
Their health!

01:32:35.347 --> 01:32:36.700
Orsa...

01:32:46.747 --> 01:32:48.465
Orsa...

01:32:51.707 --> 01:32:53.538
I leave at daybreak.

01:33:05.907 --> 01:33:09.104
All night I've been searching
for your eyes...

01:33:11.027 --> 01:33:14.417
...and it's as if for you
I don't exist...

01:33:14.467 --> 01:33:16.344
Take care...

01:33:17.427 --> 01:33:19.782
Take care of yourself...

01:33:22.467 --> 01:33:27.382
Please, I beg you,
take care of yourself.

01:33:30.387 --> 01:33:32.457
My love.

01:33:37.787 --> 01:33:40.779
<i>- Take care, Spyros.
- May the daybreak find us well!</i>

01:33:41.027 --> 01:33:42.255
<i>Good night.</i>

01:33:42.307 --> 01:33:44.138
<i>- We all had a lovely time.
- Be well!</i>

01:33:44.187 --> 01:33:46.064
<i>Thank you very much, Mina.</i>

01:33:46.307 --> 01:33:48.184
<i>Good night and have
a safe journey back!</i>

01:33:48.467 --> 01:33:49.900
<i>- Bon voyage!
- Goodbye!</i>

01:34:02.147 --> 01:34:07.858
Our Father which art in Heaven,
make us good and drunk this day.

01:34:16.267 --> 01:34:17.746
I'm three months pregnant...

01:34:22.347 --> 01:34:23.575
He doesn't know.

01:34:25.987 --> 01:34:28.455
He hasn't touched me
in two and a half months.

01:34:30.307 --> 01:34:32.457
He's changed, Orsa... completely.

01:34:33.987 --> 01:34:37.104
Running about, worries, bills...

01:34:40.427 --> 01:34:42.782
And how can I tell him now?

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:49.344
How can I tell him now
that he's leaving...

01:36:06.867 --> 01:36:12.419
<i>Early in the morning...</i>

01:36:13.707 --> 01:36:19.304
<i>... the myrrh-bearing women
came to Thee...</i>

01:36:20.947 --> 01:36:23.859
<i>... and sprinkled myrrh...</i>

01:36:24.627 --> 01:36:27.505
<i>... on Thy tomb.</i>

01:36:29.107 --> 01:36:34.420
<i>O my sweet spring...</i>

01:36:35.507 --> 01:36:40.979
<i>... my sweetest Child...</i>

01:36:42.827 --> 01:36:48.345
<i>Where has all Thy beauty faded?</i>

01:37:32.827 --> 01:37:38.459
<i>Him who now and forever
stills the winds, calms the waves...</i>

01:37:38.747 --> 01:37:41.261
<i>... causes storms
to cease and stirs...</i>

01:37:41.547 --> 01:37:45.222
<i>... the good and fitting winds
and climes...</i>

01:37:45.267 --> 01:37:48.145
<i>... be forever commander and mate
to Thy servants...</i>

01:37:48.187 --> 01:37:52.305
<i>... and guide them to safe havens.
Amen.</i>

01:38:43.947 --> 01:38:46.620
<i>The blue flows...
And we flow with it.</i>

01:38:48.227 --> 01:38:51.344
<i>With them... on the waves.</i>

01:38:56.267 --> 01:38:57.985
The silver candlesticks.

01:39:05.147 --> 01:39:08.139
For that humble home.
It's shameful...

01:39:08.587 --> 01:39:10.464
Well, they don't have electricity
there.

01:39:14.067 --> 01:39:16.342
- Let them have the binoculars.
- I need them.

01:39:17.267 --> 01:39:19.701
Bring the silver teaspoons as well.

01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:23.902
What are they going to do with them
up there in the desolate mountains?

01:39:25.627 --> 01:39:28.016
They're simple folk...
farmers with spades.

01:39:28.267 --> 01:39:29.939
They'll take a shine to them.

01:39:30.227 --> 01:39:32.616
We can't eat them
and the children need food.

01:39:34.427 --> 01:39:37.260
Trade them for chickens,
cheese, flour.

01:39:38.147 --> 01:39:40.422
Tell them we've also got curtains
and carpets...

01:39:42.947 --> 01:39:44.619
...for the next time...

01:39:47.987 --> 01:39:49.625
Just a minute. Wait.

01:39:59.427 --> 01:40:00.542
For the road...

01:40:04.587 --> 01:40:07.943
So tell me... do Italian women
have butts...

01:40:08.347 --> 01:40:09.302
...wobbly ones...

01:40:09.547 --> 01:40:10.900
Englishwomen?

01:40:11.307 --> 01:40:13.343
Broad... and withered!

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:15.459
German women?

01:40:16.427 --> 01:40:19.385
Krupp butts. As big as a tank.

01:40:19.747 --> 01:40:24.775
Good boy Savvas. Now tell me...
Argentinean women down there...

01:40:25.107 --> 01:40:27.177
What sort of asses do they have?

01:40:28.587 --> 01:40:30.225
Steaming!

01:40:30.587 --> 01:40:32.623
You aced that one!

01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:37.303
How many hurricanes have
you been in, Grandpa?

01:40:37.667 --> 01:40:40.056
Too many to count.

01:40:41.267 --> 01:40:44.862
- The worst sea is the Bay of Biscay?
- Cursed.

01:40:46.027 --> 01:40:49.099
Her ocean bed is full
of scattered bones.

01:40:49.787 --> 01:40:51.937
The biggest graveyard for our lot.

01:40:53.467 --> 01:40:58.621
Grandfather, who do you think
is the most fearless captain?

01:40:59.187 --> 01:41:01.303
Dad or Uncle Spyros?

01:41:04.027 --> 01:41:06.097
What a question, you rascal!

01:41:11.627 --> 01:41:15.063
<i>... as the German stukas
of the Wehrmacht bombed...</i>

01:41:15.107 --> 01:41:21.296
<i>... and sank ten destroyers and
torpedo boats of the Hellenic Navy...</i>

01:41:24.867 --> 01:41:30.385
<i>... the PSARRAS, the HYDRA,
the THYELLA, the DOREIS...</i>

01:41:31.507 --> 01:41:36.945
<i>... the KYDONEAE, the AEGLI,
the KIOS, the KIZIKOS...</i>

01:41:38.027 --> 01:41:40.541
<i>... the PERGAMOS,
the ARETHUSA...</i>

01:41:44.067 --> 01:41:47.264
<i>During the attempted
invasion of Crete...</i>

01:41:47.307 --> 01:41:49.662
<i>... the resistance
of the inhabitants...</i>

01:41:50.027 --> 01:41:52.302
<i>... resulted in the massacre...</i>

01:41:52.667 --> 01:41:57.183
<i>... of the 7th parachute division
of the Germans.</i>

01:41:58.747 --> 01:42:02.581
LITTLE ENGLAND

01:42:09.427 --> 01:42:13.625
<i>In the Atlantic, the greatest threat
comes not from the huge waves...</i>

01:42:13.867 --> 01:42:16.301
<i>... and the freezing cold,
but from German submarines...</i>

01:42:16.587 --> 01:42:22.219
<i>... which attack allied convoys
like wolf packs in the night.</i>

01:42:23.147 --> 01:42:26.856
<i>The battle for naval supremacy
is crucial to the outcome of the war.</i>

01:42:27.147 --> 01:42:30.219
In just the last month
14 Greek ships were lost.

01:42:30.267 --> 01:42:31.985
As for rescue operations...

01:42:32.027 --> 01:42:34.177
Rescue operations?
What rescue operations?

01:42:34.467 --> 01:42:35.616
The Americans have stopped it!

01:42:35.827 --> 01:42:37.465
How many will die
in the icy waters...

01:42:37.707 --> 01:42:39.857
...and how many
will be eaten by sharks?

01:42:41.707 --> 01:42:44.267
What the hell am I doing
in the Indian Ocean?

01:42:46.147 --> 01:42:51.221
Yannis. Signal the British
that we're changing course.

01:42:51.267 --> 01:42:52.746
Come on, lads!

01:42:53.067 --> 01:42:54.295
Let's go!

01:42:59.747 --> 01:43:02.784
The children ask me why
she's called Hexadaktylou...

01:43:02.987 --> 01:43:04.545
...since she's got five fingers!

01:43:08.507 --> 01:43:10.145
Listen to me...

01:43:10.187 --> 01:43:13.099
We have children,
we have obligations...

01:43:13.347 --> 01:43:14.541
...and we've got to hold out!

01:43:18.187 --> 01:43:21.543
Keep playing the piano,
Hexadaktylou! I'll open.

01:43:22.427 --> 01:43:23.826
There you are!

01:43:24.187 --> 01:43:26.940
- I thought we said at 2:00.
- We're half an hour late!

01:43:27.227 --> 01:43:29.138
Finally!
We've already had the first drink.

01:43:29.347 --> 01:43:31.815
- Where were you?
- We were waiting for you!

01:43:36.267 --> 01:43:38.098
Many happy returns.

01:43:38.347 --> 01:43:40.178
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:42.139
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

01:43:42.187 --> 01:43:44.496
Others are resisting
in the mountains with guns...

01:43:44.787 --> 01:43:47.096
...while chicken-hearted me,
with the piano... And raki.

01:43:47.347 --> 01:43:49.178
Just raki. Straight!

01:43:49.627 --> 01:43:52.266
I traded the piano stool
for half a bottle.

01:43:52.467 --> 01:43:54.025
- Next week the piano goes.
- Don't.

01:43:57.427 --> 01:43:58.985
Katina? Marie?

01:43:59.027 --> 01:44:02.815
They're in Athens...
nursing the wounded.

01:44:09.987 --> 01:44:11.784
"This is the BBC.

01:44:13.547 --> 01:44:18.337
Air and naval battles from
Midway to the Coral Sea...

01:44:19.187 --> 01:44:22.702
...and from the North Sea
to Madagascar.

01:44:23.547 --> 01:44:28.223
Also, allied convoys
to transport munitions...

01:44:28.627 --> 01:44:31.095
...from America to Europe.

01:44:32.107 --> 01:44:33.222
And...

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:38.825
...1,5 million Germans
dead in Russia."

01:44:39.747 --> 01:44:42.944
1,5 million Germans dead.

01:44:43.387 --> 01:44:46.060
In this instance I have to hand it
to the communists.

01:44:46.787 --> 01:44:52.339
They gave their word
that they would win, Kiki.

01:44:53.827 --> 01:44:57.342
That some day they'll
come back to us...

01:44:57.387 --> 01:45:01.426
...bringing lice in mounds
instead of pounds.

01:45:01.787 --> 01:45:05.496
Love's mystic sails,
and no more black veils!

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:08.025
No more black veils!

01:45:10.987 --> 01:45:12.022
Madame...

01:45:13.467 --> 01:45:15.264
I won't take no for an answer.

01:45:28.347 --> 01:45:30.224
I'm the man you missed
all these years.

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:50.140
That's the way my Mikes
used to dance with me.

01:45:52.387 --> 01:45:56.380
How I wish he were alive and never
mind his farting day and night.

01:45:57.267 --> 01:45:59.417
Actually, I miss his farts...

01:46:04.307 --> 01:46:06.423
Believe it or not...

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:11.378
...I still have the taste
of Vangelis' kiss on my lips...

01:46:11.427 --> 01:46:15.056
...even if he was lost at sea
17 years ago...

01:46:15.107 --> 01:46:17.462
How time flies...

01:46:18.427 --> 01:46:21.783
With war... and peace.

01:46:23.467 --> 01:46:25.537
With love affairs and childbirths.

01:46:26.427 --> 01:46:29.658
With yearning... and dignity.

01:46:31.947 --> 01:46:33.175
With work...

01:46:33.627 --> 01:46:35.777
...and the Etesian winds.

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:50.059
Katerina, your song!

01:46:50.107 --> 01:46:53.179
From that lovely record
Vangelis had sent you.

01:46:54.187 --> 01:46:55.745
Come on, say the words...

01:46:56.147 --> 01:46:57.421
I don't know what they mean.

01:46:57.787 --> 01:46:59.186
We don't need to know.

01:46:59.627 --> 01:47:03.859
Russian songs are very suited
to sadness. More than any others!

01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:06.219
Poor things, they have no news...

01:48:41.427 --> 01:48:44.544
Bafaloukas, Falangas...

01:48:46.067 --> 01:48:48.023
...Piangos, Michas, Tziotis...

01:48:50.027 --> 01:48:55.465
22 from the THRASYVOULOS
and 26 from the PANACHRANTOU.

01:48:56.907 --> 01:49:00.502
The first men from Andros
lost in this war.

01:49:01.707 --> 01:49:04.460
They want their memorial sweet...

01:49:12.147 --> 01:49:14.422
Tie the oilskin pouches...

01:49:14.467 --> 01:49:18.221
...with your seaman's book
and diploma to your waists.

01:49:18.467 --> 01:49:22.585
So they can identify our bodies
if the worst comes to the worst.

01:50:07.227 --> 01:50:08.660
For Andros.

01:50:09.587 --> 01:50:10.861
For Andros.

01:50:12.187 --> 01:50:14.257
Come on, lads.

01:51:08.627 --> 01:51:10.345
Good evening.

01:51:16.587 --> 01:51:17.906
Good evening, Moscha.

01:51:28.867 --> 01:51:33.065
From our London offices
and the British Red Cross...

01:51:34.067 --> 01:51:36.262
...we have learnt that...

01:51:41.667 --> 01:51:45.296
...a submarine picked up
three of our men...

01:51:46.547 --> 01:51:49.505
...Zanakis, Maistros...

01:51:52.307 --> 01:51:53.535
...and Boussoulas.

01:51:55.947 --> 01:52:01.067
They said that Spyros put them
in the lifeboat... he ordered them.

01:52:05.507 --> 01:52:08.544
They didn't see
what happened to him...

01:52:08.987 --> 01:52:11.501
...if he managed to save himself...

01:52:13.667 --> 01:52:15.897
LITTLE ENGLAND sank.

01:52:39.067 --> 01:52:41.023
My love!

01:52:43.067 --> 01:52:44.819
Spyros!

01:52:46.307 --> 01:52:49.902
My love! Spyros!

01:53:03.627 --> 01:53:05.265
Moscha!

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:08.023
Moscha!

01:53:08.347 --> 01:53:12.545
My sister and my husband!
Where are you?

01:53:17.387 --> 01:53:19.617
Behind my back!

01:53:29.947 --> 01:53:31.824
Your children!

01:53:40.307 --> 01:53:42.025
How many years behind my back?

01:53:45.547 --> 01:53:46.900
How many?

01:53:50.587 --> 01:53:52.578
What is this?

01:53:53.907 --> 01:53:56.262
I'll tear you to pieces!

01:54:16.467 --> 01:54:19.186
Don't come near me!
Don't come near me!

01:54:19.227 --> 01:54:21.263
Keep away from me!

01:54:35.147 --> 01:54:40.221
He was here in '33.

01:54:43.387 --> 01:54:49.303
And Mersina was born in '34.

01:54:50.987 --> 01:54:52.386
Speak up.

01:54:54.307 --> 01:54:58.186
Who is her father?
Your husband or mine?

01:56:18.427 --> 01:56:21.464
So he asked for Orsa's hand first.

01:56:23.027 --> 01:56:25.222
And I'm finding out about it now.

01:56:26.187 --> 01:56:28.655
15 years later...

01:56:30.107 --> 01:56:35.977
And you, mother... monster...
you who are so calculating...

01:56:36.027 --> 01:56:39.303
...and nothing gets by you.
What did you reply...

01:56:39.667 --> 01:56:43.057
...when he came back and asked for
the hand of your second daughter?

01:56:43.347 --> 01:56:45.144
What did you tell him? Nothing!

01:56:45.667 --> 01:56:48.022
You just chose to ignore it,
just like that.

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:50.137
You're responsible for all this.

01:56:51.147 --> 01:56:53.217
How could you?

01:56:54.467 --> 01:56:57.345
What kind of woman are you?
What kind of mother?

01:57:02.267 --> 01:57:04.383
What kind of woman am I?

01:57:04.467 --> 01:57:07.186
Well, speak up! Let's hear it!

01:57:08.187 --> 01:57:10.223
What kind of woman am I?

01:57:13.387 --> 01:57:15.696
What kind of mother am I?

01:57:18.187 --> 01:57:21.577
Look who's talking. You...

01:57:21.827 --> 01:57:27.106
You who only sent word from
the other side of the planet...

01:57:27.467 --> 01:57:30.140
...while I fought, I fought,
I fought alone...

01:57:30.547 --> 01:57:33.220
The house, two difficult females...

01:57:33.547 --> 01:57:39.463
...staying close and consoling
the widows of the seamen...

01:57:41.067 --> 01:57:44.264
...present at the 40-day memorials,
the annual memorials...

01:57:44.547 --> 01:57:48.017
...the 6-month memorials...
What kind of woman am I?

01:57:52.547 --> 01:57:56.096
Never failing to convey
your condolences...

01:57:57.707 --> 01:58:00.096
What kind of woman am I?
What kind...

01:58:02.827 --> 01:58:06.786
You destroyed us... mother.

01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:10.297
We destroyed...

01:58:12.707 --> 01:58:14.698
...we destroyed our own children.

01:58:23.427 --> 01:58:25.543
If he's alive?

01:58:27.307 --> 01:58:30.219
If he comes back?
What will he do?

01:58:33.587 --> 01:58:35.384
What will become of us?

01:58:37.947 --> 01:58:40.415
Your children will not be left
without a father.

01:59:15.307 --> 01:59:18.026
<i>Freedom, at last!
Moscha, turn the radio on.</i>

01:59:20.987 --> 01:59:23.945
I just want him to be alive
and well.

01:59:24.387 --> 01:59:26.696
The people are waiting. Come along.

01:59:29.467 --> 01:59:31.981
Please be patient... wait.

01:59:47.467 --> 01:59:49.025
Silence, please.

01:59:49.067 --> 01:59:53.663
Many were seen by Karyotakis,
Loukissas and Sybouras. Ask them.

01:59:53.987 --> 01:59:57.263
Athanasios Boulmetis, cook.
Did you see him anywhere?

01:59:57.667 --> 02:00:02.297
I saw him in Japan 6 months ago.
In a concentration camp. He's ok.

02:00:02.627 --> 02:00:05.983
Giorgakis Kalogirou? He was
a boatswain on the CYCLADES.

02:00:06.227 --> 02:00:08.024
He's alive. He was with me
in the Philippines.

02:00:08.227 --> 02:00:11.299
General MacArthour freed
5,000 prisoners. He's coming home.

02:00:11.587 --> 02:00:14.101
Any good news about my brother,
Alexandros Kyrtatas?

02:00:14.467 --> 02:00:16.583
He too was a seaman on the CYCLADES.

02:00:16.827 --> 02:00:20.581
My father, a radio operator on the
THEOMITOR, Gerassimos Balas.

02:00:20.987 --> 02:00:22.943
When's he coming?

02:00:23.187 --> 02:00:25.143
Son, there in the Philippines...

02:00:25.427 --> 02:00:28.021
...did you happen to see
my two boys?

02:00:28.427 --> 02:00:33.455
Halas! Family name Halas...
Two boys as tall as cypress trees.

02:00:35.187 --> 02:00:37.542
I don't know.
I didn't happen to see them.

02:00:52.267 --> 02:00:56.226
I was going to come...
I was going to come to the house...

02:00:58.747 --> 02:01:03.059
All 22 of us... he put us
in the lifeboat... all of us.

02:01:03.627 --> 02:01:05.424
All 22 of us.

02:01:06.467 --> 02:01:09.698
We didn't want to go...
I didn't want to go.

02:01:12.467 --> 02:01:15.061
He cussed me, he ordered me,
he gave me a couple of punches...

02:01:15.307 --> 02:01:17.025
...and threw me into the lifeboat.

02:01:21.587 --> 02:01:23.498
I didn't want to leave him.

02:01:37.187 --> 02:01:41.419
<i>Valiant men...</i>

02:01:41.907 --> 02:01:45.582
<i>... of Andros.</i>

02:01:47.707 --> 02:01:51.302
<i>Bones scattered in the depths...</i>

02:01:54.307 --> 02:01:57.265
Orsa... Would you like
the binoculars?

02:01:59.067 --> 02:02:01.137
<i>... of distant oceans...</i>

02:02:01.587 --> 02:02:03.259
Go away.

02:02:04.307 --> 02:02:09.062
<i>... in the embrace of history...</i>

02:02:11.907 --> 02:02:17.539
<i>... they tell of mourning and sorrow.</i>

02:02:23.267 --> 02:02:28.261
<i>For us there is no forgetting...</i>

02:02:29.387 --> 02:02:34.302
<i>... a journey with open sails.</i>

02:02:34.347 --> 02:02:40.502
<i>In sorrow and pride...</i>

02:02:42.307 --> 02:02:47.779
<i>... with laurel wreaths.</i>

02:03:31.947 --> 02:03:34.222
A heavy toll of blood...

02:03:35.627 --> 02:03:40.257
...since 31 ships from Andros sunk.

02:03:42.347 --> 02:03:47.216
On the last convoy it joined
the freighter LITTLE ENGLAND...

02:03:48.187 --> 02:03:52.544
...was carrying cotton and wheat
from New Orleans.

02:03:54.267 --> 02:03:57.657
It was torpedoed
off the Irish Coast...

02:03:58.107 --> 02:04:02.225
...on 11 March 1943.

02:04:04.027 --> 02:04:09.624
<i>Spyros Maltabes sacrificed
his life for his men.</i>

02:04:11.187 --> 02:04:14.304
<i>He stayed on the bridge...</i>

02:04:15.067 --> 02:04:18.457
<i>... and went down with his ship.</i>

02:04:20.347 --> 02:04:23.578
<i>The Bronze Medal for Valor
belongs to his family.</i>

02:04:39.307 --> 02:04:41.867
The sixth Maltabes to die.

02:04:58.307 --> 02:04:59.581
His daughter.

02:06:45.147 --> 02:06:46.785
I'm sorry...

02:07:01.827 --> 02:07:03.545
I know all about it.

02:07:07.107 --> 02:07:08.859
She dresses in black...

02:07:10.987 --> 02:07:13.660
She won't eat.
She never leaves the house...

02:07:14.427 --> 02:07:17.419
We haven't spoken
in almost 3 years.

02:07:18.627 --> 02:07:20.219
We don't talk.

02:07:21.147 --> 02:07:24.219
But the whole island
is talking about us.

02:07:26.187 --> 02:07:28.781
There's no room for all of us
on Andros any more.

02:08:08.467 --> 02:08:11.698
You'll be better off without me...

02:08:13.107 --> 02:08:15.177
...there...

02:08:19.187 --> 02:08:23.066
I lost... I lost friends
on the destroyer...

02:08:24.867 --> 02:08:27.256
...then others in the Middle East.

02:08:27.547 --> 02:08:29.299
I lost the ships...

02:08:30.547 --> 02:08:35.496
But I found a good job working
in a shipping office in New York.

02:08:37.667 --> 02:08:40.306
That's where we're going
the four of us.

02:08:41.267 --> 02:08:44.623
Others are also taking their families
and moving to England or America.

02:08:46.507 --> 02:08:48.065
You'll like it there.

02:08:52.307 --> 02:08:53.183
And mother?

02:08:56.587 --> 02:08:58.225
She's staying here.

02:09:02.267 --> 02:09:05.384
- Alone?
- She'll come later...

02:09:07.587 --> 02:09:09.145
As soon as she's strong enough.

02:09:09.387 --> 02:09:11.582
Are you punishing her?

02:09:14.107 --> 02:09:17.019
You can leave, as many of you
as you like... go wherever you like.

02:09:17.387 --> 02:09:20.424
I'm going to sea...
I'm getting my seaman's papers.

02:09:25.667 --> 02:09:29.216
And yet it's the right thing for you.

02:09:31.267 --> 02:09:32.541
Mersina...

02:09:34.267 --> 02:09:36.019
My beauty.

02:09:58.427 --> 02:10:00.065
Andros...

02:10:08.187 --> 02:10:11.975
We have exhausted all the
options science has to offer.

02:10:12.187 --> 02:10:15.020
I don't know what the professor
can contribute, but...

02:10:15.267 --> 02:10:19.385
...if the patient doesn't cooperate
there's nothing more we can do.

02:10:26.107 --> 02:10:29.304
I brought so much medication,
so many syrups...

02:10:29.347 --> 02:10:32.020
...tonic injections from America...

02:10:32.067 --> 02:10:34.501
She throws the pills
out of the window.

02:10:34.707 --> 02:10:39.542
Professor, I've asked you to come
to the island as a last resort...

02:10:39.907 --> 02:10:43.024
We'll take her to Athens...
to London...

02:10:44.507 --> 02:10:46.702
I'll sell the house if necessary...

02:10:47.067 --> 02:10:51.697
Dyscataposia, atony, hardship
in general, I would say...

02:10:52.387 --> 02:10:55.185
But the patient isn't cooperating.

02:10:55.227 --> 02:10:58.060
Inside her the only thing
that's getting stronger...

02:10:58.267 --> 02:10:59.939
...is the spirit of denial.

02:11:00.747 --> 02:11:02.738
Uncle Emilios!

02:11:07.427 --> 02:11:09.941
Where have you disappeared to
all this time?

02:11:14.907 --> 02:11:16.135
Uncle Emilios!

02:11:50.627 --> 02:11:55.178
FROM SPYROS MALTABES
TO EMILIOS MALTABES

02:12:07.187 --> 02:12:10.259
FOR LITTLE ORSA

02:12:31.107 --> 02:12:35.339
<i>Give me the letters.
All 17 of them.</i>

02:12:36.427 --> 02:12:38.418
<i>I'm tired.</i>

02:12:38.787 --> 02:12:40.857
<i>I need to know...</i>

02:12:42.107 --> 02:12:44.257
...how much he loved you.

02:12:47.947 --> 02:12:50.336
I must know if he ever loved me too.

02:12:52.587 --> 02:12:54.384
Orsa...

02:13:36.547 --> 02:13:38.583
What's become of you?

02:13:53.187 --> 02:13:55.337
Calcutta...

02:13:56.507 --> 02:14:01.501
27 September 1929.

02:14:04.307 --> 02:14:06.025
Surabaya...

02:14:07.427 --> 02:14:10.578
7 October 1929.

02:14:12.347 --> 02:14:14.144
Lorenzo Marques...

02:14:15.187 --> 02:14:19.863
13 March 1930.

02:14:25.507 --> 02:14:27.338
Odessa...

02:14:30.267 --> 02:14:32.383
2 May 1930.

02:14:38.267 --> 02:14:41.862
All written in '29 and '30...

02:14:43.707 --> 02:14:46.175
...before my marriage.

02:14:49.227 --> 02:14:53.823
I had learnt to think of him...

02:14:55.267 --> 02:14:57.542
...and to love him...

02:14:58.627 --> 02:15:00.743
...since I was 12.

02:15:07.067 --> 02:15:08.898
It was in November.

02:15:10.347 --> 02:15:12.656
There was a bad storm...

02:15:17.627 --> 02:15:20.095
...and I saw him...

02:15:24.587 --> 02:15:26.145
He was 19...

02:15:30.747 --> 02:15:33.386
...throwing off his white shirt...

02:15:36.027 --> 02:15:38.336
...and diving...

02:15:39.427 --> 02:15:41.258
...into the waves...

02:15:46.307 --> 02:15:48.537
...for a bet.

02:15:52.147 --> 02:15:54.183
I wanted to love...

02:15:58.787 --> 02:16:01.062
...to love very much...

02:16:05.547 --> 02:16:07.617
...to love for ever.

02:16:14.427 --> 02:16:16.019
He loved you, Moscha...

02:16:20.027 --> 02:16:21.938
He loved you...

02:16:26.587 --> 02:16:28.418
You are loved...

02:16:34.547 --> 02:16:36.299
In life...

02:16:40.947 --> 02:16:46.544
...it seems the things you lose...

02:16:48.507 --> 02:16:50.577
...are worth more...

02:16:51.387 --> 02:16:53.343
...than the things you find.

02:16:53.387 --> 02:16:56.265
The things you find are lost again.

02:16:57.427 --> 02:17:00.544
The things you lost exist for ever.

02:18:09.267 --> 02:18:10.985
Orsa...

02:18:41.867 --> 02:18:45.462
The Maltabes Circle...

02:18:55.907 --> 02:18:58.057
Damned floorboards!

02:19:02.987 --> 02:19:05.501
It's the ceiling's fault.

02:19:07.667 --> 02:19:10.545
It wouldn't let me forget him.

02:19:11.027 --> 02:19:14.337
I could hear his high spirits...

02:19:15.107 --> 02:19:17.667
...his words, his footsteps...

02:19:19.307 --> 02:19:21.343
...when he took off his shoes...

02:19:23.707 --> 02:19:26.301
...the muffled tomfoolery...

02:19:27.947 --> 02:19:31.542
...your bodies thrashing
on the bed...

02:19:46.387 --> 02:19:48.582
The floorboards.

02:19:53.387 --> 02:19:55.264
Before the wedding...

02:19:57.547 --> 02:20:00.300
...he was to make a down payment
on a house in Kastella...

02:20:01.587 --> 02:20:03.066
...in Piraeus.

02:20:05.707 --> 02:20:08.585
I told him I'm not leaving Andros.

02:20:18.467 --> 02:20:21.777
That day when you had us
for dinner...

02:20:23.307 --> 02:20:26.060
...and I went to fetch Nana...

02:20:27.027 --> 02:20:29.587
Who was limping. I remember.

02:20:35.067 --> 02:20:37.376
Before going to her house...

02:20:38.627 --> 02:20:40.857
...I met him...

02:20:41.867 --> 02:20:45.223
...for the first time,
secretly and alone...

02:20:46.707 --> 02:20:48.823
...after ten years...

02:20:50.427 --> 02:20:52.463
...for half an hour...

02:20:56.467 --> 02:20:58.503
...by the sea...

02:20:59.627 --> 02:21:01.345
...on the rocks...

02:21:12.107 --> 02:21:14.257
SOS...

02:21:14.307 --> 02:21:20.496
...that's what he wrote
with his hand on my breast.

02:21:23.107 --> 02:21:25.223
SOS.

02:22:52.827 --> 02:22:56.058
She asked to attend the service
because Saint Nicholas...

02:22:56.387 --> 02:23:01.097
...is the patron saint of seamen and
all the men in her life were seamen.

02:23:01.147 --> 02:23:04.662
Grandfather, father, uncles, husband,
son and the man she loved.

02:23:05.547 --> 02:23:09.062
And she had the courage to name them
all to Moscha in just that order.

02:23:09.307 --> 02:23:12.583
I don't care what some people say...
I love them both.

02:23:58.187 --> 02:24:00.940
Do you have any photograph of hers?

02:24:01.587 --> 02:24:03.543
In my mind, a lot...

02:24:04.027 --> 02:24:07.019
Ever since I picked her up
off the street...

02:24:08.107 --> 02:24:12.259
...adopted her child...
unknown father...

02:24:14.347 --> 02:24:19.182
Last night I felt like telling Orsa,
before it's too late...

02:24:19.507 --> 02:24:21.418
...and to Moscha of course...

02:24:21.987 --> 02:24:25.662
...that they have a brother,
even though he's far away...

02:24:26.907 --> 02:24:28.579
...but I didn't dare.

02:24:30.187 --> 02:24:33.304
I made a mess of things
both here and there.

02:24:36.547 --> 02:24:38.105
Spyros...

02:24:40.867 --> 02:24:42.186
Spyros...

02:24:51.867 --> 02:24:53.903
I finished it at dawn.

02:24:58.107 --> 02:25:01.543
All alone on the waves.

02:25:04.307 --> 02:25:05.581
Him too.

02:25:31.147 --> 02:25:34.423
Neither of us
ever saw the ship up close...

02:25:44.987 --> 02:25:46.545
Moscha...

02:25:54.587 --> 02:25:57.385
...you're the only one
who isn't to blame.

02:26:05.427 --> 02:26:09.784
Had he lived...

02:26:14.507 --> 02:26:18.182
...what would have happened
with the two of us?

02:26:27.387 --> 02:26:29.343
If only he had lived...

02:26:41.227 --> 02:26:43.422
If we had studied...

02:26:45.427 --> 02:26:46.860
...something...

02:26:50.067 --> 02:26:52.376
If we had found a job...

02:26:57.027 --> 02:26:59.461
Or if we had gone away...

02:27:01.587 --> 02:27:03.339
...far away...

02:27:07.387 --> 02:27:09.184
If we had talked...

02:27:12.907 --> 02:27:14.977
If we had talked, Moscha...

02:27:18.187 --> 02:27:20.576
...back then...

02:28:12.787 --> 02:28:14.584
May!
