00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.810
Stiles, what the hell are you doing?!

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.590
You weren't answering your phone.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.250
Why do you have a bat?

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.520
I thought you were a predator.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.620
A pre--

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.160
I--wha--look, I know it's late,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.430
but you gotta hear this.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.130
I saw my dad leave 20 minutes ago.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.070
Dispatch called.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.120
They're bringing in every officer

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.410
from the Beacon Department,
and even State Police.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.810
For what?

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.570
Two joggers found a body in the woods.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.690
A dead body?

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.840
No, a body of water.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.380
Yes, dumb-ass, a dead body.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.270
You mean like murdered?

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.390
Nobody knows yet.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.420
Just that it was a girl,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.450
probably in her 20s.

00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:54.640
Hold on, if they found the body,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.730
then what are they looking for?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.280
That's the best part.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.510
They only found half.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.530
We're going.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.330
We're seriously doing this?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.090
You're the one always bitching

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.630
that nothing ever happens in this town.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.120
I was trying to get a good night's sleep

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.230
before practice tomorrow.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.640
Right, 'cause sitting on the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.160
bench is such a grueling effort.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.150
No, because I'm playing this year.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.190
In fact, I'm making first line.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.330
Hey, that's the spirit.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.350
Everyone should have a dream,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.890
even a pathetically unrealistic one.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.160
Just out of curiosity,

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.160
which half of the body are we looking for?

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.740
Huh!

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.510
I didn't even think about that.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.640
And, uh, what if whoever

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.090
killed the body is still out here?

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.060
Also something I didn't think about.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.570
Uhh!

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.160
It's...comforting to know

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.330
you've planned this out

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.830
with your usual attention to detail.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.830
I know.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.830
Maybe the severe asthmatic

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.830
should be the one holding
the flashlight, huh?

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.590
Wait, come on!

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.930
Stiles!

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.970
Wait up!

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.600
Stiles!

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.090
Stiles!

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.290
Hold it right there!

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.260
Hang on, hang on.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.620
This little delinquent belongs to me.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.980
Dad, how are you doing?

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.210
So, do you, uh, listen in
to all of my phone calls?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.630
No, heh.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.430
Not the boring ones.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.940
Now, where's your usual partner in crime?

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.460
Who, Scott?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.500
Sc-Scott's home.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.580
He said he wanted to get
a good night's sleep

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.820
for first day back at school tomorrow.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.180
It's just me.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.230
In the woods.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.740
Alone.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.210
Scott, you out there?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.710
Scott?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.190
Well, young man,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.980
I'm gonna walk you back to your car.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.390
And you and I are gonna have a conversation

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.940
about something called invasion of privacy.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.580
Dude...watch the paint job.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.900
Yo, Jackson, let's go, bro.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.100
Okay, let's see this thing.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.240
Ooh!

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.400
Yeah. Whoa!

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.540
It was too dark to see much,

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.040
but I'm pretty sure it was a wolf.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.520
A wolf bit you?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.480
Uh-huh.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.600
No, not a chance.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.310
I heard a wolf howling.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.410
No, you didn't.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.070
What do you mean, no, I didn't?

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.110
How do you know what I heard?

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.680
Because California doesn't have
wolves, okay?

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.480
Not in like 60 years.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:19.650
Really?

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.350
Yes, really.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.220
There are no wolves in California.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.820
All right, well, if you don't believe me
about the wolf,

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.260
then you're definitely not gonna believe me

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.770
about when I tell you I found the body.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.160
You--are you kidding me?

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.300
No, man, I wish.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.660
I'm gonna have nightmares for a month.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.450
Oh, god, that is freakin' awesome.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.480
I mean, this is seriously
gonna be the best thing

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.720
that's happened to this town since--

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.100
Since the birth of Lydia Martin.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.620
Hey, Lydia...You look...

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.780
Like you're gonna ignore me.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.410
You're the cause of this, you know.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.380
Uh-huh.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.080
Draggin' me down to your nerd depths.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.730
I'm a nerd by association.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.100
I've been scarlet nerded by you.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.240
As you all know, there indeed

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.250
was a body found in the woods last night.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.590
And I am sure your eager little

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.850
minds are coming up with various

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.860
macabre scenarios as to what happened.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.310
But I am here to tell you that

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.410
the police have a suspect in custody,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.990
which means you can give
your undivided attention to

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.020
to the syllabus which is on your

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.080
desk outlining this semester.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.700
Mom, three calls on my

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.070
first day is a little overdoing it.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.380
Everything except a pen.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.400
Oh, my God, I didn't actually forget a pen.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.410
Okay, okay. I gotta go.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.180
Love ya.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.020
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.560
So you were saying San Francisco

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.780
isn't where you grew up?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.530
No, but we lived there
for more than a year,

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.130
which is unusual in my family.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.590
Well, hopefully Beacon Hills

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.100
will be your last stop for a while.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.690
Class, this is our new
student, Allison Argent.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.980
Please do your best to
make her feel welcome.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.240
Thanks.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.430
We'll begin with Kafka's
Metamorphosis, on page 133.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.600
That jacket is absolutely killer.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.360
Where'd you get it?

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.920
My mom was a buyer for a
boutique back in San Francisco.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.070
And you are my new best friend.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.830
Hey.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.590
Can someone tell me how new girl
is here all of five minutes,

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.890
and she's already hanging
out with Lydia's clique?

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.640
Because she's hot.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.700
Beautiful people herd together.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.330
So, this weekend, there's a party.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.560
A party?

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.750
Yeah...Friday night.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.030
You should come.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.390
Uh, I can't.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.970
It's family night this Friday.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.260
Thanks for asking.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.370
You sure? I mean, everyone's
going after the scrimmage.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.030
You mean like football?

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.810
Football's a joke in Beacon.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.360
The sport here is lacrosse.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.910
We've won the state championship

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.960
for the past three years.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.050
Because of a certain team captain.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.620
Well, we have practice in a few minutes.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.490
That is, if you don't have anywhere else--

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.330
Well, I was going to--

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.840
Perfect...You're coming.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.040
But if you play...

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.450
I'll have no one to talk to on the bench.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.870
Are you really gonna do
that to your best friend?

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.080
I can't sit out again.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.910
My whole life is sitting on the sidelines.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.660
This season, I make first line.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:04.630
McCall!

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.540
Yeah?

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:06.550
You're on goal.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.010
I've never played.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.360
I know--scoring some shots

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.910
will give the boys a confidence boost.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.090
It's a first day back thing.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.540
Get 'em energized, fired up!

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.680
What about me?

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.230
Try not to take any in the face.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.170
Let's go! Come on!

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.520
Who is that?

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.280
Him?

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.930
I'm not sure who he is.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.840
Why?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.270
He's in my English class.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.470
Hey, way to catch with your face, McCall!

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.310
Unh!

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.920
I don't know what it was.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.730
It was like I had all the time

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.160
in the world to catch the ball.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.360
And that's not the only weird thing.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.140
I can...hear stuff I
shouldn't be able to hear.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.450
Smell things.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.290
Smell things? Like what?

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.040
Like mint mojito gum in your pocket.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.400
I don't even have any mint mojito--

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.800
So all this started with a bite.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.960
What if it's like an infection,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.170
like my body's flooding
with adrenaline before

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.630
I go into shock or something?

00:14:59.140 --> 00:14:59.730
You know what?

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.620
I actually think I've heard of this--

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.340
It's a specific kind of infection.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.410
Are you serious?

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:05.150
Yeah.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.130
Yeah, I think it's called lycanthropy.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.820
What's that?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.520
Is that bad?

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.560
Oh, yeah, it's the worst.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.010
But only once a month.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:14.700
Once a month?

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.670
Mm-hmm.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.990
On the night of the full moon.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.780
Hey, you're the one who
heard a wolf howling.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.530
Hey, there could be something
seriously wrong with me.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.160
I know! You're a werewolf!

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.190
Rrr!

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.950
Okay, obviously I'm kidding.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.750
But if you see me in shop class

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.730
trying to melt all the silver I can find,

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.130
it's 'cause Friday's a full moon.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.730
No, I-I could have sworn this was it.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.550
I saw the body, the deer came running.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.130
I dropped my inhaler.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.000
Maybe the killer moved the body.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.120
If he did, I hope he left my inhaler.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.550
Those things are like 80 bucks.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.170
What are you doing here?

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.370
Huh?

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.620
This is private property.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.770
Uh, sorry, man, we didn't know.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.760
Yeah, we were just looking
for something, but...

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.190
Uh, forget it.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.420
All right, I gotta get to work.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.290
Dude, that was Derek Hale.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:25.650
You remember, right?

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.930
He's only like a few years older than us.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.610
Remember what?

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.650
His family.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.790
They all burned to death in a fire,

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.960
like, ten years ago.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.140
I wonder what he's doing back.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:37.660
Come on.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.300
Hey, kitties.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.500
Hi.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:34.530
I didn't see it.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.980
I took my eyes off the road for,

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.150
like, two seconds to change
the song on my iPod,

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.160
and then this dog,

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.370
it just came out of nowhere!

00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:40.930
It's all right, it's all right,

00:17:40.931 --> 00:17:41.940
it's all right.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.260
Do you remember where it happened

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.580
so I can send Animal Control to find it?

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.040
No! I mean, yes, I know where I hit it,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.180
but the dog is--

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:48.910
Where is it?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.900
It's in my car.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.960
You okay?

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.070
She's just frightened.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.090
That makes two of us.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.730
Let me see if I have any better luck.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.790
I think her leg is broken.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.820
I've seen the doctor do plenty of splints.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.130
I can do it myself and then give

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.470
her a painkiller for now.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.940
Yeah, I have a shirt in my bag.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:24.910
Oh, I don't want to trouble you.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.110
Here.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.620
What?

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.320
I didn't see anything.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.130
Thanks for doing this.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.230
I feel really stupid.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.710
How come?

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.000
I don't know.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.790
'Cause I freaked out like a total girl.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.510
You are a girl.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.300
I freaked out like a girly girl,

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.680
and I'm not a girly girl.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.720
What kind of girl are you?

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.360
Tougher than that.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.000
At least, I thought I was.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.990
Hey, I'd be freaked out too.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.080
In fact, I'd probably cry.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:21.850
And not like a man, either.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.860
Like the biggest girly girly ever.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.250
It'd be pathetic.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.280
Yeah, right.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.630
So...It looks like she's gonna live.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.550
And I'm pretty sure she'll
even let you pet her now,

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.660
if you want.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.540
I don't think so.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.840
Oh, come on.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.270
You don't want her to sue.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.270
I hear this breed is very litigious.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.340
You see?

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:58.770
She likes you.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.180
What?

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.200
I don't know. Sorry.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.170
You have an eyelash on your cheek.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.890
Oh. It's from the crying.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.800
Thanks.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.290
Yeah.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.860
So, um...

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.170
I was wondering...

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.080
I mean...

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.790
Is it really family night on Friday,

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.300
or do you think maybe you'd like to

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.540
go to that party with me?

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.930
Family night was a total lie.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.190
So is that a yes, you'll go?

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.030
Definitely yes.

00:22:46.584 --> 00:22:47.916
Good morning.

00:22:56.779 --> 00:22:58.277
All right, little man.

00:22:58.278 --> 00:23:01.045
How 'bout you tell me where
you're getting your juice.

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:01.945
What?

00:23:01.946 --> 00:23:05.412
Where are you getting your juice?

00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:10.627
My mom does all the grocery shopping.

00:23:12.312 --> 00:23:13.644
Now, listen, McCall...

00:23:13.645 --> 00:23:14.612
You're gonna tell me exactly

00:23:14.613 --> 00:23:15.712
what it is and who you're buying

00:23:15.713 --> 00:23:17.113
it from, because there's no way

00:23:17.114 --> 00:23:18.011
in hell you're out there kicking

00:23:18.012 --> 00:23:18.781
ass on the field like that

00:23:18.782 --> 00:23:20.392
without some sort of chemical boost.

00:23:21.249 --> 00:23:23.794
Oh, you mean steroids.

00:23:24.213 --> 00:23:25.210
Are you on steroids?

00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:26.980
What the hell is going on with you, McCall?

00:23:27.146 --> 00:23:28.453
What's going on with me?

00:23:28.579 --> 00:23:29.827
You really wanna know?

00:23:30.374 --> 00:23:31.711
Well, so would I!

00:23:31.712 --> 00:23:33.158
Because I can see, hear, and smell things

00:23:33.159 --> 00:23:35.132
that I shouldn't be able
to see, hear, and smell.

00:23:35.133 --> 00:23:36.440
I do things that should be impossible,

00:23:36.441 --> 00:23:39.056
I'm sleepwalking three miles
into the middle of the woods,

00:23:39.057 --> 00:23:41.810
and I'm pretty much convinced that
I'm totally out of my freaking mind!

00:23:47.237 --> 00:23:48.703
You think you're funny...

00:23:48.704 --> 00:23:50.236
Don't you, McCall?

00:23:50.237 --> 00:23:51.903
I know you're hiding something.

00:23:51.904 --> 00:23:54.236
I'm gonna find out what it is.

00:23:54.237 --> 00:23:55.504
I don't care how long it takes.

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:01.569
Scott! Scott, wait up.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:02.703
Stiles, I'm playing the first

00:24:02.704 --> 00:24:03.837
elimination, man--
Can it wait?

00:24:03.838 --> 00:24:05.104
Just hold on, okay?

00:24:05.105 --> 00:24:06.504
I overheard my dad on the phone.

00:24:06.505 --> 00:24:07.937
The fiber analysis came back

00:24:07.938 --> 00:24:08.937
from the lab in L.A.

00:24:08.938 --> 00:24:09.870
They found animal hairs on the

00:24:09.871 --> 00:24:10.703
body from the woods!

00:24:10.704 --> 00:24:11.538
Stiles, I gotta go.

00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:12.371
Wait, no! Scott!

00:24:12.372 --> 00:24:14.736
You're not gonna believe
what the animal was!

00:24:14.737 --> 00:24:15.870
It was a wolf.

00:24:17.037 --> 00:24:18.503
Let's go! Gather round!

00:24:18.504 --> 00:24:20.903
Bring it in, come on!

00:24:20.904 --> 00:24:22.354
Come on!

00:24:24.937 --> 00:24:26.669
Got a question, McCall?

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:27.602
What?

00:24:27.603 --> 00:24:28.603
You raised your hand.

00:24:28.604 --> 00:24:29.603
You have a question?

00:24:29.604 --> 00:24:31.636
Oh...No. I was just, uh...

00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:32.870
Nothing. Sorry.

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:34.869
Okay. You know how this goes.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.736
If you don't make the cut,

00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:38.937
you're most likely sitting on

00:24:38.938 --> 00:24:40.637
the bench for the rest of the season.

00:24:40.638 --> 00:24:41.603
You make the cut...

00:24:41.604 --> 00:24:42.603
You play.

00:24:42.604 --> 00:24:43.936
Your parents are proud.

00:24:43.937 --> 00:24:45.969
Your girlfriend loves ya!

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:46.969
Huh?

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.736
Everything else is, uh...

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:50.769
Cream cheese.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.537
Now, get out there and show me

00:24:52.538 --> 00:24:53.969
whatcha got!

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:54.904
Come on!

00:24:54.905 --> 00:24:55.870
Let's go! Let's go!

00:25:09.837 --> 00:25:11.504
Uhh!

00:26:03.703 --> 00:26:04.769
McCall!

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.336
Get over here!

00:26:06.337 --> 00:26:08.437
What in God's name was that?

00:26:08.438 --> 00:26:10.203
This is a lacrosse field.

00:26:10.204 --> 00:26:12.702
What, are you trying out
for the gymnastics team?

00:26:12.703 --> 00:26:13.903
No, coach.

00:26:13.904 --> 00:26:15.071
What the hell was that?

00:26:15.072 --> 00:26:16.203
I don't know.

00:26:16.204 --> 00:26:17.637
I--just trying to make the shot.

00:26:17.638 --> 00:26:20.003
Yeah, well, you made the shot.

00:26:20.004 --> 00:26:22.303
And guess what?

00:26:22.304 --> 00:26:23.736
You're startin', buddy.

00:26:23.737 --> 00:26:26.470
You made first line.

00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:27.836
Come on!

00:26:27.837 --> 00:26:29.870
First line!

00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:08.170
Get in.

00:27:08.171 --> 00:27:09.171
You gotta see this thing.

00:27:09.172 --> 00:27:10.603
I've been up all night reading--

00:27:10.604 --> 00:27:11.670
websites, books.

00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:12.538
All this information.

00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:13.404
How much Adderall have you

00:27:13.405 --> 00:27:14.503
had today?

00:27:14.504 --> 00:27:15.538
A lot. Doesn't matter.

00:27:15.539 --> 00:27:16.371
Okay, just listen.

00:27:16.372 --> 00:27:17.271
Oh, is this about the body?

00:27:17.272 --> 00:27:18.237
Did they find out who did it?

00:27:18.238 --> 00:27:19.237
No, they're still questioning

00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:20.304
people, even Derek Hale.

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:21.237
Oh, the guy in the woods that

00:27:21.238 --> 00:27:22.071
we saw the other day.

00:27:22.072 --> 00:27:22.904
Yeah! Yes.

00:27:22.905 --> 00:27:23.804
But that's not it, okay?

00:27:23.805 --> 00:27:24.804
What, then?

00:27:24.805 --> 00:27:26.637
Remember the joke from the other day?

00:27:26.638 --> 00:27:29.203
Not a joke anymore.

00:27:29.204 --> 00:27:31.203
The wolf--the bite in the woods.

00:27:31.204 --> 00:27:33.103
I started doing all this reading.

00:27:33.104 --> 00:27:34.869
Do you even know why a wolf howls?

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:35.233
Should I?

00:27:35.234 --> 00:27:36.602
It's a signal, okay?

00:27:36.603 --> 00:27:37.603
When a wolf's alone, it howls

00:27:37.604 --> 00:27:39.903
to signal its location
to the rest of the pack.

00:27:39.904 --> 00:27:41.470
So if you heard a wolf howling,

00:27:41.471 --> 00:27:43.204
that means others could have been nearby.

00:27:43.205 --> 00:27:44.237
Maybe even a whole pack of 'em.

00:27:44.238 --> 00:27:45.869
A whole pack of wolves?

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.914
No...Werewolves.

00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:52.070
Are you seriously wasting
my time with this?

00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:53.904
You know I'm picking up Allison in an hour.

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:55.737
I saw you on the field today, Scott.

00:27:55.738 --> 00:27:57.570
Okay, what you did wasn't
just amazing, all right?

00:27:57.571 --> 00:27:58.903
It was impossible.

00:27:58.904 --> 00:28:00.736
Yeah, so I made a good shot.

00:28:00.737 --> 00:28:03.003
No, you made an incredible shot, I mean...

00:28:03.004 --> 00:28:05.070
The way you moved, your
speed, your reflexes.

00:28:05.071 --> 00:28:07.236
People can't just suddenly
do that overnight.

00:28:07.237 --> 00:28:09.389
And there's the vision and the senses,

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.485
and don't even think I don't notice that

00:28:10.486 --> 00:28:11.670
you don't need your inhaler anymore.

00:28:11.671 --> 00:28:13.504
Okay! Dude, I can't think about this now.

00:28:13.505 --> 00:28:14.737
We'll talk tomorrow.

00:28:14.738 --> 00:28:15.770
Tomorrow?! What? No!

00:28:15.771 --> 00:28:16.603
The full moon's tonight.

00:28:16.604 --> 00:28:17.438
Don't you get it?

00:28:17.439 --> 00:28:18.304
What are you trying to do?

00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:19.603
I just made first line.

00:28:19.604 --> 00:28:20.804
I got a date with a girl who I

00:28:20.805 --> 00:28:22.624
can't believe wants to go out

00:28:22.625 --> 00:28:24.504
with me, and everything in
my life is somehow perfect.

00:28:24.505 --> 00:28:25.804
Why are you trying to ruin it?

00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:28.303
I'm trying to help.

00:28:28.304 --> 00:28:30.969
You're cursed, Scott.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:32.271
You know, and it's not just the

00:28:32.272 --> 00:28:34.204
moon will cause you
to physically change.

00:28:34.205 --> 00:28:35.204
It also just so happens to be

00:28:35.205 --> 00:28:38.203
when your bloodlust
will be at its peak.

00:28:38.204 --> 00:28:39.836
Bloodlust?

00:28:39.837 --> 00:28:41.936
Yeah, your urge to kill.

00:28:41.937 --> 00:28:43.371
I'm already starting to feel

00:28:43.372 --> 00:28:44.603
an urge to kill, Stiles.

00:28:44.604 --> 00:28:48.203
You gotta hear this.

00:28:48.204 --> 00:28:49.371
"The change can be caused by

00:28:49.372 --> 00:28:51.770
anger or anything that
raises your pulse."

00:28:51.771 --> 00:28:52.670
All right?

00:28:52.671 --> 00:28:53.770
I haven't seen anyone raise your

00:28:53.771 --> 00:28:54.937
pulse like Allison does.

00:28:54.938 --> 00:28:57.003
You gotta cancel this date.

00:28:57.004 --> 00:28:58.004
I'm gonna call her right now.

00:28:58.005 --> 00:28:58.837
What are you doing?

00:28:58.838 --> 00:28:59.737
I'm canceling the date.

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:03.203
No, give it to me!

00:29:03.204 --> 00:29:04.637
Aargh!

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.304
I'm sorry.

00:29:16.637 --> 00:29:20.271
I-I gotta go get ready for that party.

00:29:27.538 --> 00:29:28.832
I'm sorry.

00:29:51.063 --> 00:29:51.931
Mom!

00:29:53.016 --> 00:29:54.856
Is this a party or a date?

00:29:56.697 --> 00:29:58.436
Maybe both.

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:00.362
And her name is...

00:30:00.363 --> 00:30:01.254
Allison.

00:30:01.255 --> 00:30:03.566
Allison. Nice.

00:30:05.697 --> 00:30:06.946
Thank you.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.068
We don't need to have a talk, do we?

00:30:10.445 --> 00:30:12.311
Mom, I'm not having the
safe sex talk with you.

00:30:12.312 --> 00:30:14.155
Oh, my God.

00:30:14.156 --> 00:30:16.513
No, I meant about keeping the tank full.

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:17.746
Give me those back.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.223
Are you serious?

00:30:19.224 --> 00:30:20.862
You bet your ass I am serious.

00:30:20.863 --> 00:30:23.328
I'm not gonna end up on some
reality television show

00:30:23.329 --> 00:30:24.980
with a pregnant 16-year-old.

00:30:24.981 --> 00:30:25.865
Come on!

00:31:08.464 --> 00:31:09.179
You okay?

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.259
What? Yeah.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.278
I'm fine.

00:32:09.182 --> 00:32:10.616
Are you okay?

00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:15.716
I'll be right back.

00:32:23.482 --> 00:32:24.838
Yo, Scott, you good?

00:32:27.349 --> 00:32:28.194
Are you okay?

00:32:46.574 --> 00:32:48.307
Allison.

00:32:48.308 --> 00:32:50.241
I'm a friend of Scott's.

00:32:55.007 --> 00:32:56.974
My name's Derek.

00:33:51.574 --> 00:33:52.739
Go away.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.107
Scott, it's me.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.540
Let me in, Scott.

00:33:57.541 --> 00:33:58.573
I can help.

00:33:58.574 --> 00:34:01.573
No! Listen, you gotta find Allison.

00:34:01.574 --> 00:34:02.540
She's fine, all right?

00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:04.241
I saw her get a ride from the party.

00:34:04.242 --> 00:34:05.241
She's--she's totally fine.

00:34:05.242 --> 00:34:06.208
No, I think I know who it is.

00:34:06.209 --> 00:34:07.208
You just let me in.

00:34:07.209 --> 00:34:08.074
We can try--

00:34:08.075 --> 00:34:08.451
It's Derek.

00:34:08.452 --> 00:34:09.874
Derek Hale is the werewolf.

00:34:09.875 --> 00:34:10.774
He's the one that bit me.

00:34:10.775 --> 00:34:14.606
He's the one that killed
the girl in the woods.

00:34:14.607 --> 00:34:16.940
Scott...Derek's the one who

00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:18.416
drove Allison from the party.

00:34:23.274 --> 00:34:24.274
Scott!

00:35:26.939 --> 00:35:28.051
Hi, Mrs. Argent.

00:35:28.052 --> 00:35:30.804
Um...You have no idea who I am.

00:35:30.805 --> 00:35:32.039
I'm a friend of your daughter's.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.630
Uh...Look, this is gonna
sound kind of crazy, um...

00:35:34.631 --> 00:35:36.479
Really crazy, actually.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.500
You know what? Crazy doesn't--

00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:38.722
Allison!

00:35:38.723 --> 00:35:40.092
It's for you.

00:35:58.702 --> 00:36:00.467
Where is she?

00:36:00.468 --> 00:36:02.900
She's safe.

00:36:02.901 --> 00:36:06.067
From you.

00:36:06.068 --> 00:36:07.602
Raagh!

00:36:13.502 --> 00:36:14.568
What did you do with her?

00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:18.267
Shh, quiet.

00:36:18.268 --> 00:36:19.667
Too late.

00:36:19.668 --> 00:36:20.668
They're already here.

00:36:20.669 --> 00:36:22.168
Run.

00:36:29.468 --> 00:36:31.568
Aah!

00:36:48.201 --> 00:36:51.534
Take him.

00:36:51.535 --> 00:36:53.268
Uhh!

00:36:55.435 --> 00:36:56.267
Uhh!

00:36:56.268 --> 00:36:57.869
Whah! Oh!

00:37:00.502 --> 00:37:01.968
Aah!

00:37:22.135 --> 00:37:24.234
Who were they?

00:37:24.235 --> 00:37:25.667
Hunters.

00:37:25.668 --> 00:37:26.668
The kind that have been hunting

00:37:26.669 --> 00:37:28.334
us for centuries.

00:37:28.335 --> 00:37:29.900
Us? You mean you!

00:37:29.901 --> 00:37:32.567
You did this to me!

00:37:32.568 --> 00:37:34.401
Is it really so bad, Scott?

00:37:34.402 --> 00:37:36.534
That you can see better...

00:37:36.535 --> 00:37:38.034
Hear more clearly, move faster

00:37:38.035 --> 00:37:41.734
than any human could ever hope?

00:37:41.735 --> 00:37:42.735
You've been given something that

00:37:42.736 --> 00:37:45.734
most people would kill for.

00:37:45.735 --> 00:37:47.667
The bite is a gift.

00:37:47.668 --> 00:37:50.033
I don't want it.

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.868
You will.

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:52.901
And you're gonna need me if you

00:37:52.902 --> 00:37:55.501
want to learn how to control it.

00:37:55.502 --> 00:37:57.701
So you and me, Scott...

00:37:57.702 --> 00:37:59.207
We're brothers now.

00:38:26.702 --> 00:38:29.033
You know what actually worries me the most?

00:38:29.034 --> 00:38:32.033
If you say Allison, I'm gonna
punch you in the head.

00:38:32.034 --> 00:38:33.435
She probably hates me now.

00:38:33.436 --> 00:38:35.434
Ugh.

00:38:35.435 --> 00:38:36.467
I doubt that.

00:38:36.468 --> 00:38:37.468
But you might want to come up

00:38:37.469 --> 00:38:40.534
with a pretty amazing apology.

00:38:40.535 --> 00:38:42.367
Or, you know, you could just...

00:38:42.368 --> 00:38:43.967
Tell her the truth and...

00:38:43.968 --> 00:38:44.968
Revel in the awesomeness of the

00:38:44.969 --> 00:38:47.017
fact that you're a frickin' werewolf.

00:38:49.635 --> 00:38:51.005
Okay, bad idea.

00:38:53.034 --> 00:38:54.493
Hey, we'll get through this.

00:38:55.135 --> 00:38:56.868
Come on, if I have to, I'll

00:38:56.869 --> 00:38:58.368
chain you up myself on full moon

00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:00.601
nights and feed you live mice.

00:39:00.602 --> 00:39:02.357
I had a boa once. I could do it.

00:39:11.772 --> 00:39:12.462
So what happened?

00:39:12.463 --> 00:39:14.347
You left me stranded at the party.

00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:15.668
Yeah, I--I know, I know.

00:39:15.669 --> 00:39:17.933
I'm really sorry, I am.

00:39:17.934 --> 00:39:19.567
But...You're gonna have to trust

00:39:19.568 --> 00:39:21.309
that I had a really good reason.

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:23.801
Did you get sick?

00:39:23.802 --> 00:39:27.134
I definitely had an attack of something.

00:39:27.135 --> 00:39:29.334
Am I gonna get an explanation?

00:39:29.335 --> 00:39:30.402
Can you just find it in your

00:39:30.403 --> 00:39:33.033
heart to trust me on this one?

00:39:33.034 --> 00:39:34.801
Am I gonna regret this?

00:39:34.802 --> 00:39:36.934
Probably.

00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:40.467
So is that a yes on a second chance?

00:39:40.468 --> 00:39:41.735
Definitely yes.

00:39:43.735 --> 00:39:45.567
That's my dad.

00:39:45.568 --> 00:39:46.635
I better go.

00:39:46.835 --> 00:39:48.835
