00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:52.389
Please. Please.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.969
I have credits. Take them.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.743
He says you spilled his drink.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:56.735
It's fine.

00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:58.831
It's on me.

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.344
Here.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.493
Thank you! Thank you very much!

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.289
You have my heartfelt gratitude.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.253
You know what? Here.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.707
You take my credits.

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:53.758
Buy yourself a drink.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.586
Oh.

00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:58.928
Is that a bounty puck?

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.766
Is that me?

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:10.520
Look...
Uh, there must be some mistake.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.227
I can get you more credits.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.997
I can bring you in warm...

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:17.414
Or I can bring you in cold.

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:44.643
I need passage to the yards.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.407
No droids.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.402
Where to?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.292
You know what he's looking for?

00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:49.291
You're looking for Ravinaks, right?

00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:51.293
It's clear right now.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.129
But be careful near the port.

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.921
Everyone dumps their Gray Holds out.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:01.125
They think the whole entire planet
is their own personal stink pit.

00:05:11.562 --> 00:05:12.812
Here you are.

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:17.267
- You're kidding me, right?
- Get out.

00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:21.033
I'll hire us a Livery Cruiser.

00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:23.163
No big deal.
It won't come out of your end.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.490
I'll pay for it.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.985
I'm just trying to make it pleasant.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.157
Hey, it's time to go, so let's settle up.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.460
I'd stay off the ice if I were you.

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.301
You think there's really something
to worry about?

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.110
Open the hatch! Open the hatch!

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.213
Dank farrik, that was close!

00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.706
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:18.804
"Stay off the ice."

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.759
That's the understatement
of the millennium.

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:30.215
It's taking us down. What're you doing?

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.187
It's got us. It's gonna take us under.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.439
Where you going?

00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:40.574
You got to do something!
We got to get out of here!

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.008
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.720
Yes. All right.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.858
Whew.

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:27.703
I like your ship. She's a classic.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.034
Razor Crest, am I right?

00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:33.621
Pre-Empire?

00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:37.918
I have a lot of credits, by the way.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.960
That's why I offered to hail a Cruiser.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.973
How much are they paying you?

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:54.767
Is it true that you guys
never take off your helmets?

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.981
Boy.

00:08:01.732 --> 00:08:03.612
I think I have to use the vacc tube.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.900
I mean I can do it here,

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:11.029
but if you've never seen
a Fledgling Mythrol evacuate their thorax,

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.616
you're a lucky guy, trust me.

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.963
Clearly, there's nowhere for me to go.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:21.457
So, uh...

00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:24.634
I'm gonna look for that vacc tube
if it's all the same to you?

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:26.764
Great.

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.228
Found it!

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.440
Thanks. It might take a while.

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:45.895
I'm molting.

00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:06.128
Oh, this feels a lot better.

00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:09.052
I haven't evacuated since the solstice.

00:09:14.638 --> 00:09:15.718
Yeah.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.929
I was hoping to be free for Life Day.

00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:21.135
Maybe even, uh...

00:09:26.108 --> 00:09:28.818
Get home to the family.

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:38.119
But I guess that's
not gonna happen this year.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.543
Probably not.

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:50.901
Ah, that was fast.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:53.113
Did you catch them all?

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:00.737
Good. I'll begin the off-load.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.647
These are Imperial Credits.

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:15.432
They still spend.

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:17.849
I don't know if you heard,
but the Empire is gone.

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:19.759
It's all I've got.

00:11:21.974 --> 00:11:23.854
Save the theatrics.

00:11:24.393 --> 00:11:25.643
Fine, I'll...

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:29.476
I can do Calamari Flan...

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:31.855
But I can only pay half.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.530
Fine.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.683
Hmm. I have a bail jumper...

00:11:57.843 --> 00:11:59.393
A bail jumper,

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:03.183
another bail jumper, a wanted smuggler.

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:04.465
I'll take them all.

00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:05.808
No. Hold on.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:10.685
There are other members of the Guild,
and this is all I have.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.022
Why so slow?

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:14.527
It's not slow at all, actually. Very busy.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.950
They just don't want to pay Guild rates.

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:19.571
They don't mind if things get sloppy.

00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:23.078
- What's your highest bounty?
- Not much.

00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:24.794
Five thousand.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.960
That won't even cover fuel these days.

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:28.786
Hmm.

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.591
There is one job.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.920
Let's see the puck.

00:12:37.466 --> 00:12:38.506
No puck.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.389
Face to face.

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:41.966
Direct commission.

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.063
Deep pocket.

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:45.598
Underworld?

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:50.442
All I know is no chain code.

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:54.357
Do you want the chit or not?

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:28.115
Greef Karga said you were coming.

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:37.398
What else did he say?

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.630
He said you were the best in the parsec.

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.030
- Freeze!
- No!

00:14:47.054 --> 00:14:48.414
Drop your weapons!

00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.241
No, no, no, no.
Pardon. Uh, sorry.

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:53.265
I didn't mean to alarm.

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:56.937
This is Doctor Pershing.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.693
Please excuse his lack of decorum.

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:05.357
His enthusiasm outweighs his discretion.

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:07.566
Please lower your blaster.

00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:09.488
Have them lower theirs first.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.386
We have you four to one.

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.439
I like those odds.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.750
He also said you were expensive.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.880
Very expensive.

00:15:23.382 --> 00:15:24.552
Please sit.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:50.656
Beskar?

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.952
Go ahead. It's real.

00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:58.173
This is only a down payment.

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:04.422
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting for you
upon delivery of the asset.

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.506
Alive.

00:16:05.591 --> 00:16:07.381
Yes. Alive.

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:09.761
Although, I acknowledge

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.640
that bounty hunting
is a complicated profession.

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:15.891
This being the case,

00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:21.725
proof of termination is also acceptable
for a lower fee.

00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:24.436
That is not what we agreed upon.

00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:27.317
I'm simply being pragmatic.

00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:30.304
Let's see the puck.

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:33.489
I'm afraid discretion dictates

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.959
a less traditional agreement.

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:39.996
We can only offer you a tracking fob.

00:16:44.755 --> 00:16:46.165
What's the chain code?

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:49.925
We can only provide the last four digits.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.760
Their age? That's all you can give me?

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:57.181
Yes. They're 50 years old.

00:16:58.143 --> 00:17:01.813
We can also give you
last reported positional data.

00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:04.727
Between that and the fob,

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:08.606
a man of your skill
should make short work of this.

00:17:17.955 --> 00:17:22.745
The Beskar belongs back
into the hands of a Mandalorian.

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:26.707
It is good to restore
the natural order of things

00:17:26.797 --> 00:17:29.297
after a period of such disarray,

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.680
don't you agree?

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.523
This was gathered
in the Great Purge.

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.345
It is good it is back with the Tribe.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:47.101
Yes.

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:49.976
A pauldron would be in order.

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:54.071
- Has your signet been revealed?
- Not yet.

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:55.992
Soon.

00:20:30.272 --> 00:20:35.072
This is extremely generous.
The excess will sponsor many Foundlings.

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:37.104
That's good.

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.661
I was once a Foundling.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.780
I know.

00:23:35.374 --> 00:23:37.714
Thank you.

00:23:39.086 --> 00:23:41.086
You are a bounty hunter.

00:23:42.089 --> 00:23:43.299
Yes.

00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:48.682
I will help you.

00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:53.015
I have spoken.

00:24:10.409 --> 00:24:12.369
Many have passed through.

00:24:12.744 --> 00:24:14.914
They seek the same one as you.

00:24:15.581 --> 00:24:16.751
Did you help them?

00:24:17.082 --> 00:24:18.292
Yes.

00:24:19.001 --> 00:24:20.131
They died.

00:24:21.712 --> 00:24:23.842
Well, then I don't know
if I want your help.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.510
You do.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.050
I can show you to the encampment.

00:24:29.553 --> 00:24:30.723
What's your cut?

00:24:30.804 --> 00:24:31.974
Half.

00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:34.555
Half the bounty to guide? Seems steep.

00:24:35.225 --> 00:24:38.595
No. Half of the blurrg you helped capture.

00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:41.017
The blurrg? You can keep them both.

00:24:41.106 --> 00:24:42.816
No, you will need one.

00:24:43.609 --> 00:24:44.689
To ride.

00:24:45.068 --> 00:24:48.568
The way is impossible to pass
without a blurrg mount.

00:24:49.448 --> 00:24:51.198
I don't know how to ride blurrg.

00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:53.791
I have spoken.

00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:04.879
Perhaps if you removed your helmet.

00:25:04.963 --> 00:25:07.383
Perhaps he remembers I tried to roast him.

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:12.219
This is a female.
The males are all eaten during mating.

00:25:41.917 --> 00:25:43.637
I don't have time for this.

00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:46.629
Do you have a Landspeeder
or Speeder bike that I could hire?

00:25:46.713 --> 00:25:48.093
You are Mandalorian!

00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:53.095
Your ancestors rode the great Mythosaur.

00:25:54.263 --> 00:25:57.063
Surely you can ride this young foal.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.080
Easy. Easy.

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:19.959
Now, all right. Settle down.

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:22.039
Whoa!

00:26:22.124 --> 00:26:24.594
Settle. Settle.

00:26:26.295 --> 00:26:27.955
That's good. That's good.

00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:33.433
Easy. Okay.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.850
That's good.

00:26:37.222 --> 00:26:38.272
All right.

00:26:50.569 --> 00:26:51.569
Oh!

00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:43.366
That is where you'll find your quarry.

00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:50.246
Please. You deserve this.

00:27:50.337 --> 00:27:52.377
Since these ones arrived,

00:27:52.464 --> 00:27:55.344
this territory has been an endless stream

00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:59.715
of mercenaries seeking reward
and bringing destruction.

00:28:00.556 --> 00:28:02.136
Then why did you guide me?

00:28:02.224 --> 00:28:04.104
They do not belong here.

00:28:04.184 --> 00:28:07.104
Those that live here come to seek peace.

00:28:07.187 --> 00:28:10.267
There will be no peace until they're gone.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.530
Then why do you help?

00:28:13.694 --> 00:28:15.904
I have never met a Mandalorian.

00:28:16.446 --> 00:28:18.406
I've only read the stories.

00:28:20.617 --> 00:28:24.447
If they are true,
you will make quick work of it.

00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:27.917
Then there will again be peace.

00:28:32.296 --> 00:28:33.626
I have spoken.

00:29:15.422 --> 00:29:16.472
Oh, no.

00:29:17.216 --> 00:29:18.376
Bounty Droid.

00:29:19.301 --> 00:29:22.301
Subparagraph 16 of
the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver

00:29:22.387 --> 00:29:25.467
compels you to immediately
produce said asset.

00:29:45.202 --> 00:29:46.252
Droids.

00:29:48.872 --> 00:29:52.172
Subparagraph 16 of
the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver

00:29:52.251 --> 00:29:55.091
compels you to immediately produce
said asset.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.920
IG Unit! Stand down.

00:30:01.885 --> 00:30:03.675
I'm in the Guild!

00:30:03.762 --> 00:30:05.142
You are a Guild member?

00:30:05.222 --> 00:30:08.102
I thought I was the only one
on assignment.

00:30:08.851 --> 00:30:10.061
That makes two of us.

00:30:10.727 --> 00:30:12.307
So much for the element of surprise.

00:30:12.396 --> 00:30:14.056
Sadly, I must ask for your fob.

00:30:14.147 --> 00:30:17.437
I have already issued the writ of seizure.
The bounty is mine.

00:30:17.526 --> 00:30:21.106
Unless I'm mistaken,
you are, as of yet, empty-handed.

00:30:21.196 --> 00:30:22.406
This is true.

00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:24.634
- I have a suggestion.
- Proceed.

00:30:24.658 --> 00:30:26.138
We split the reward.

00:30:26.827 --> 00:30:28.287
This is acceptable.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.330
Great. Now let's regroup,
out of harm's way, and form a plan.

00:30:32.416 --> 00:30:35.286
I will of course receive
the reputation merits

00:30:35.377 --> 00:30:36.797
associated with the mission.

00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:38.459
Can we talk about this later?

00:30:40.382 --> 00:30:43.012
I require an answer if I am to proceed...

00:30:43.093 --> 00:30:45.263
Oh, no. Alert. Alert. Alert.

00:30:47.848 --> 00:30:49.968
Oh!

00:30:54.396 --> 00:30:56.646
Let's go!

00:31:17.544 --> 00:31:18.804
He's in there!

00:31:18.879 --> 00:31:19.919
Affirmative.

00:31:36.813 --> 00:31:38.153
Up top!

00:31:51.495 --> 00:31:52.815
It appears we are trapped.

00:31:53.455 --> 00:31:56.375
I will initiate self-destruct sequencing.

00:31:57.835 --> 00:31:59.245
Whoa, you're what?

00:31:59.336 --> 00:32:02.256
Manufacturers Protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.

00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:05.549
- I must self-destruct.
- Do not self-destruct.

00:32:06.134 --> 00:32:07.184
Cover me!

00:32:25.821 --> 00:32:28.491
Go! Go! Go! There's too many!

00:32:36.331 --> 00:32:37.684
They got us pinned.

00:32:43.505 --> 00:32:45.295
I will initiate self-destruct.

00:32:45.382 --> 00:32:48.052
Do not self-destruct!
We're shooting our way out.

00:32:52.264 --> 00:32:53.314
Okay.

00:32:55.517 --> 00:32:56.557
New plan!

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.750
Beginning self-destruct countdown.

00:33:02.774 --> 00:33:03.934
No! Stop it!

00:33:06.778 --> 00:33:08.818
Draw their fire, I'll take it out.

00:33:08.906 --> 00:33:10.406
- Acceptable.
- Go!

00:33:42.648 --> 00:33:43.768
Well done.

00:33:45.484 --> 00:33:48.034
I will disengage self-destruct initiative.

00:33:51.949 --> 00:33:53.709
You know, you're not so bad.

00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:56.159
- For a droid.
- Agreed.

00:33:56.245 --> 00:33:58.455
That blaster hit looks nasty. You okay?

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.670
Running a quick diagnostic.

00:34:02.543 --> 00:34:04.503
It has missed my central wiring harness.

00:34:04.586 --> 00:34:05.786
Is that good?

00:34:06.213 --> 00:34:07.343
Yes.

00:34:07.673 --> 00:34:10.073
Well,
now we just need to get the door open.

00:34:40.455 --> 00:34:41.745
Anyone else?

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.210
The tracking fob is still active.

00:34:45.294 --> 00:34:48.764
My sensors indicate
that there is a life form present.

00:35:21.205 --> 00:35:22.455
Wait.

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:24.249
They said 50 years old.

00:35:25.542 --> 00:35:27.042
Species age differently.

00:35:28.962 --> 00:35:31.512
Perhaps it could live many centuries.

00:35:33.342 --> 00:35:35.892
Sadly, we'll never know.

00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:37.299
No.

00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:40.179
We'll bring it in alive.

00:35:40.641 --> 00:35:45.441
The commission was quite specific.
The asset was to be terminated.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:08.050
