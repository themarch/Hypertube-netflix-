00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.069
Armies, for the most part,

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:57.736
are made up of men drawn from
simple and peaceful lives.

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:00.076
In time of war, they
suddenly find themselves...

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:02.286
living under conditions
of violence,

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:06.286
requiring new rules of conduct
that are in direct contrast...

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:09.289
to the conditions they
lived under as civilians.

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:13.423
They learn to accept this and to
perform their duties as fighting men.

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:18.303
But some begin to perform, as
military language puts it,

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:22.098
"at the risk of life, above
and beyond the call of duty."

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.218
Military histories
are filled with

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.720
incredible examples of
individual courage...

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:32.567
that are only made more incredible by the
fact that they were everyday events.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.819
As Senior Staff Officer at Supreme
Headquarters in Worid War Il,

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.318
it was my privilege to know
the records of many such men.

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:45.162
The story you are about
to see is theirs:

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.582
The true story of
the foot soldier,

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.498
as seen through the eyes of
one of them, Audie L. Murphy.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:56.086
He received every decoration for
valor that his country could award,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.094
and he became the most decorated
soldier for combat action...

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.718
in the military history
of the United States.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:08.979
<i>In 1937, in northeast
Texas, at the age of 12,</i>

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.352
<i>Murphy was already
a fair rifleman.</i>

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:51.392
I don't suppose you giris have had time
to fill the wood box. Uh-uh, Audie.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.311
Hey, Audie, look at me!

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.773
Get off that woodpile, Preston.
Do you want to break a leg?

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.694
Did you get another
rabbit today, Audie?

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.159
Yeah. Now you come with me.

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:09.909
You sit down right over there.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.411
You watch that until I
get back, okay? Okay.

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:17.338
It'll keep you off the woodpile.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.753
Now, you watch it.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:22.502
<i>Hi, Mom. Audie.</i>

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.088
I saw Mr. Huston today. He said
he'd get the window fixed.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.554
- That's good of him.
- He was askin' about Pa.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.345
No word today.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.141
But we'll be hearing
from him real soon.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.032
Hi, Mr. Brooks! Hi!

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.584
Any mail for us
today, Mr. Brooks?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:05.132
Nothing today, Mrs.
Murphy. Sorry.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.098
Thank you. Maybe tomorrow. Bye.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.224
Why does Mom get so worried
when no mail comes?

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.973
Because we got no money.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.985
Here, take these to the house.
Where are you goin'?

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.862
I just made my mind
up about something.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:37.498
When he makes up his mind, he sure
does it sudden. Where is he goin'?

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:42.916
Hi, Mr. Huston. Hello, Audie.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:47.963
That was a first-rate job you did on
that chicken coop the other day. Thanks.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.389
Hi, Mrs. Huston. Hello, Audie.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:54.678
Sir, I know you don't hire any
steady help except at picking time,

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.104
but could you give
me a full-time job?

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.143
A full-time job?

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.355
I wouldn't want much
money, and you could

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.312
keep half until we pay
back what we owe you.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:08.824
What does your ma say to that? <i>I wanted to
talk to you before I said anything to her.</i>

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.946
It's not right. Why, you'd
have to quit school.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.915
Yes, ma'am, but I
need the money.

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:19.957
What about your sister in Farmersville?
Can't she help? Edna.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.171
Corinne's helped all she
can, but, well, she's

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.508
got a family of her
own to take care of.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:30.634
A boy your age! You can't do it, Ben.
This is man's talk.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:34.300
Will you please go to the
house, and let me run the farm?

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.179
Seems like she's forgot, Audie,

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.811
I never finished school neither.

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.484
A couple years older
than you, I quit to go

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.983
in the Marines when we
was in the big war.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.406
<i>Sometimes I wish I'd stayed in.</i>

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:53.952
Probably be retired by now on more
money than I make out of the farm.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.247
Now about that job...

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.911
I guess the best thing to
do is leave it to your ma.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:04.789
Thanks a lot, Mr. Huston.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.924
Ma, I got a full-time job!
I'm gonna

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:13.798
work for Mr. Huston
in the morning.

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.804
But you've got to go to school.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:18.307
I don't care for school.
I don't like it anymore.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.479
You can't stop your
education now.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.807
I'll learn, Ma. I'll read books.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:26.815
We can't go on without money.
We can manage a little longer.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.192
Your daddy's doing the best
he can, and we can wait...

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.277
We can't keep waitin'
for some old

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:34.117
letter that maybe
won't ever get here.

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:46.456
- What's the matter, Mom?
- Nothing, dear.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.008
Audie and I were just
talking things over.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.507
<i>Something bad?</i> Of course not.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.600
We just decided who the
head of the family is.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.960
It's your turn. I
did them yesterday!

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.079
You did not! Gene
keeps saying...

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.334
Shh! Gene keeps saying it's my
turn to do the dishes today.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.677
Who did them yesterday?

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:35.804
I forget.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:39.100
<i>Beatrice and I did
them, and he knows it.</i>

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.645
Then you do them today, and
you won't forget tomorrow.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:46.482
Besides, your hands could use
a little soap and water.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.821
Smarty. I told you so.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.368
Time for breakfast, Mom.
Oh, thank you.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.296
All the kids are home
from Sunday school.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.499
They can do everything that
needs to be done today,

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.297
so don't you try to get up.
Yes, sir.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:18.306
I'm gonna take a run over to Mr. Huston's.
But this is Sunday.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:22.886
This is not about work. Jim, their
nephew, is on leave from the Marines,

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.972
I haven't seen him since he went in.
Oh, I see.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:30.060
You try to eat. I won't be long.
All right.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.626
<i>The Japanese bombers
swept over the island...</i>

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:38.763
Come in, Audie. <i>At 7:55 this
morning, Honolulu time.</i>

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.182
Pearl Harbor has been attacked.
<i>The attack was without warning,</i>

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.869
<i>and launched from aircraft
carriers standing off Hawaii.</i>

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:47.206
Casualties among naval personnel
will run into the thousands.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:51.331
At Hickam Field, the barracks
sustained a direct hit.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.588
<i>Details are at a minimum, but we will
continue to interrupt broadcasts...</i>

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.502
<i>as more information reaches us.</i>

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.255
Ben, we're really at war.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:02.140
We sure are. <i>How does
this affect you, Jim?</i>

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.389
I'll probably be ordered
back to base right away.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:07.263
<i>It'll be an honor to
serve, and don't you ever</i>

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.856
<i>forget it.! You've got
the best training!</i>

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.731
I've had a lot of it, anyway.
<i>Why, you leathernecks...</i>

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.854
<i>will have this war
won in two months.</i>

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:18.195
Just wish I was young
enough to help you do it.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.860
Biggest mistake I
made was gettin' out.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.863
Why, I might have been a
general by this time.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.581
I'll bet you... Never mind, General.
War or no war,

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.576
you boys are gonna eat
the doughnuts I fixed.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.543
I'll get a pitcher of milk.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:37.380
I was too optimistic, Audie,
but so was a lot of folks.

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:41.594
War is gonna last longer than
most of us figured. How aboutJim?

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:46.094
You heard from him lately? He's doin'
real good. Up to sergeant now.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:48.772
Audie!

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.936
You gotta come home! It's Ma!

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.360
All of a sudden Ma got worse!
How about Doc Snyder?

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.653
Is he with her? I called him.
He should be by now.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.659
Doc, is she...

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.169
She went peacefully.

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:15.714
I should have been with her.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:17.878
She didn't know, Audie.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:23.097
She was happy and proud of you and
her family, right up till the end.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.303
<i>I'll telephone Corinne...</i>

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.681
<i>and make all the
necessary arrangements.</i>

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.530
If you don't let the children
come into the church orphanage,

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:46.783
Social Welfare will place them
in some public institution.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:51.121
I took care of'em for a long time.
I can take care of'em now.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.209
He's right, Audie.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:02.470
All right... if that's
the way it has to be.

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.555
As soon as I can, I'm
gonna get them out.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.018
I know this must seem like
the end of the worid, Audie,

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.524
after taking care of your
family all these years,

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.314
but look at it another way.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.484
You've got no responsibilities
left now, except to yourself.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.649
It's time you were thinking
about your future.

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:28.412
I have been. That's what
I wanted to tell you.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.868
After all the talk you and I had about
it, I've decided to go into the service.

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:33.663
I was hoping you'd say that.

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:36.837
It'll be a great chance for you
to catch up on your education.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:42.381
Yeah. The only thing is, I hate running out
on the kids. They've had enough of that.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:47.799
You can do more for 'em with your service
pay than you can by staying here.

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:50.954
I guess I hadn't thought
of it that way.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:55.264
Course, being under age, you'll
have to get a letter of permissión.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.517
I'll get Corinne to
write one for me.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.646
Good-bye, Mr. Huston. Thanks.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.983
If I were you, Audie, I'd
think about it for a career.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:08.361
You stay in 20 years, and you
can retire on good money.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:11.826
Don't make the mistake that I made.
I might have been a general...

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.658
Yes, sir. I'll remember that.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:22.003
It'll take more than a letter from your
guardian to get you in this outfit, sonny.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.677
We separate the men from the boys, but
we like to have something to start with.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.139
Why don't you try the Army?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.854
I'm sorry. The Navy
makes men out of boys,

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.353
but you're too much
of a job for us.

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.685
Why don't you try the Army?

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.704
Attention! Attention, please!

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.769
This being our fourth day at
sea, it is now permissible...

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:59.377
to report our destination as
being French North Africa,

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:03.457
<i>which we will reach in
approximately five more days.</i>

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.468
<i>According to the last communique
on the fighting in Tunisia,</i>

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:10.172
<i>the Axis forces are still
retreating toward the coast.</i>

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:14.977
<i>Their losses in men and equipment
are reported to be extremely high.</i>

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:19.599
<i>Further bulletins will be announced
as received. That is all.</i>

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:24.103
Sure picked a beaut for acting
platoon sergeant, didn't they? Huh?

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:57.261
Murphy, here you are.
Baker Company.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:01.732
Well, what do you know?
We're being reinforced.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.729
Wonder what Boy Scout troop
they dug him out of.

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:09.823
Don't let them old
soldiers eat you alive.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:15.196
Man, that's really
fresh meat, huh?

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:22.995
Sergeant? Hmm?

00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:25.171
I'm supposed to report
to Captain Marks.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:29.047
All officers and noncomms are at división
briefing. You're the replacement?

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.049
That's right. Let's
have your orders.

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.888
Hey, Sergeant, send
him over here.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.512
I need somebody to help
carry my Purple Hearts.

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.514
At ease over there!

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:40.771
Fall in for inspection.
You go to 3rd Platoon.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:45.067
Hey, wait a minute.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:50.026
I see you were acting sergeant on
the trip across. Ain't that nice?

00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:54.034
I think you should see the way some real
tough veterans handle their equipment.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.532
You inspect the 3rd Platoon!

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:00.449
Acting Sergeants, take over
and inspect your platoons!

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.664
<i>Platoon, attention.!</i>

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.162
What's this man's
Army coming to?

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.458
Ayardbird replacement, already
he's taken over the platoon.

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:13.174
<i>Open ranks.! Open ranks, march.!</i>

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:16.298
Platoon, attention!

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:19.014
Open ranks, march!

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.316
Ready, hut!

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.599
How did you collect all those Purple
Hearts? Did your rifle blow up?

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:13.276
<i>...promote the general welfare
and secure the blessing...</i>

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:17.485
of liberty to ourselves
and our póster-ity...

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:21.622
Posterity. Ah,
that's what I said.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:25.997
...do ordain and establish
this Constitution...

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:28.795
for the United
States of America.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:32.882
By George! I know that, all right!
That's pretty good.

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:37.638
<i>Now, what date was it adopted?
Uh, 1774.</i>

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.469
<i>Oh.! Six.!</i>

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:42.805
No, no, no. What was
signed in 1776?

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:46.472
Oh, the Declaration of Independence.
Right.

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.809
That other was 1774.
No, it wasn't.

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:54.022
<i>Chief, he doesn't want to be an
American citizen. He isn't even trying.</i>

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:58.446
Uh, 1780...

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.118
1787. That's right.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.244
But don't just guess. Memorize it.
Yeah, I do that.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:12.206
<i>Hey, Chief, coffee ready.
You have some, huh?</i>

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:15.797
- From Casablanca to Bombay So send me...
- Hey, Johnson!

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:18.299
What do you got this time?

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:20.555
Bonded date juice.

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:25.143
"Bonded date juice"? You're gonna go
blind drinking that native stuff.

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:28.476
I might as well with nothing
but you Joes to look at.

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:31.437
That reminds me of an
old gal I met in Omaha.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:34.562
<i>She was colorblind. Took her out to
buy her a red dress... Never mind.</i>

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:37.068
We've all heard that one.
You and your dames.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.365
It's the dyin' truth.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.995
Here. Oh, no, not me. I wouldn't
touch that with a bayonet.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:50.002
- What are you doing with my rifle?
- Now, drink!

00:18:58.012 --> 00:19:01.096
Now hold it on me
so I can have one.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.773
This stuff don't smell right.

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:16.353
You don't suppose that connivin'
first sergeant... He knew I had it.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.365
Knock it off so a guy can
get some sleep, will you?

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:24.946
Mail call! Mail call!

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:28.749
Here we go for the
"DearJohn" roundup!

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.121
<i>Stevens.! Right here.!</i>

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.295
<i>Arthur.! Yo.!</i>

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:35.794
<i>Jacobs.! Here.!</i> You
know about mail call?

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:38.626
<i>Casano.! Yep.!</i> I don't
think my mail...

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:42.963
has caught up with me yet.
Oh, too bad.

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:45.306
<i>Brooks.! Here.!</i>

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.476
<i>Cooper.! Yeah.</i>

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.847
<i>Gomez.! Here.</i>

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.975
<i>Eisenburg. Uh-huh.</i>

00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:59.647
<i>Davis.!</i> Oh, Brandon.

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.819
<i>Dugan.! Yo.!</i>

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:04.822
You dropped something. <i>Everett.!</i>

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:07.825
<i>Family?</i>

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:10.323
They were once.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.826
<i>Harper.! Roger.!</i>

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:18.332
Sir, Private Murphy reports to the
company commander as ordered.

00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:21.464
Lieutenant Harris, 3rd Platoon leader.
Murphy.

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:24.175
We've been looking
over your file.

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.553
"Spent the first week of basic
training in the hospital:

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.018
<i>Reaction from inoculations."</i>

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.314
Yes, sir. L-I'd never
had any shots before.

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:38.143
"Spent most of the trip
over in sick bay."

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:41.322
Yes, sir.

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:44.066
L- I'd never been on
the ocean before.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.780
Well, there were a lot of
other guys in there with me.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.365
"Requested transfer
to paratroops.

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.910
Denied due to physical
deficiencies."

00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:59.544
It was a mistake assigning
you to a rifle company,

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.007
and I'm going to see
that you're reassigned.

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:08.348
But, sir, I asked for a combat outfit.
I don't want anything else.

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:12.185
Well, except for the jumps, duty with us
is just as rugged as a paratrooper's.

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.683
The captain's trying
to do you a favor.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.523
I know that, sir, but...

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.021
I don't want any favors.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.186
I don't want to be transferred.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.029
All right. I believe in
giving a man a chance.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.032
Especially if he wants one as
bad as you do. That's all.

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:35.200
Feisty pup, isn't he?

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:38.207
Yeah, but he's got a good side to him.
Did you notice?

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:42.207
Practically all his pay goes for bonds
in the name of an older sister.

00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:44.129
It looks like he signed
for every educational

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.547
course we've got
during training.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.094
He's got the spirit,
but, in action,

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:51.888
it's gonna take two strong
men to take care of him.

Hey, that connivin' first
sergeant must have been here too!

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:02.078
<i>Come on, honey, have
a slug of this stuff.</i>

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:04.377
It won't hurt you a bit.
Honest. This is good

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.875
for you. It picks up
your whole attitude.

00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:10.845
<i>A toast to the one and
only 3rd División.!</i>

00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:18.224
Turn on the radio so we can dance!
Can you jitterbug?

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:22.978
<i>- Little Texas.!</i>
- One day, I was drivin' along...

00:23:23.986 --> 00:23:25.648
<i>Hey, Little Texas,
where you been?</i>

00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:28.321
I went to Alaska on a vacation.
Hey, that's great.

00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:30.398
You must need something
to warm you up.

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:32.366
Come on. I got just
the thing to do it.

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:35.366
Hey, Cleopatra! Come here!
Come here!

00:23:35.873 --> 00:23:38.866
I want you to meet a friend from Alaska.
He owns a gold mine.

00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:42.206
Would you like to dance with me?

00:23:43.297 --> 00:23:46.506
I'm not very good at it. If Cleo
can't teach you, nobody can!

00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:13.108
What's all the excitement about?

00:24:13.202 --> 00:24:16.115
The Germans have surrendered in Tunisia!
Did I hear right?

00:24:16.205 --> 00:24:18.697
Africa's all ours?
That's what she said!

00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:21.625
Hey, talk about luck! With us
about to move into the line!

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.872
All that training for nothing!
We'll be goin' home!

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:35.964
"Goin' home," he says.
That's where we're goin'.

00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:38.300
I just didn't know we had to
take Sicily to get there.

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:41.311
To hell and back, that's
where this outfit's goin'.

00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:43.764
General Patton was just
tellin' me the other day,

00:24:44.274 --> 00:24:46.812
"You boys think that Fedela
landin' was somethin',

00:24:47.277 --> 00:24:49.143
"you just wait
till the next one.

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:53.486
It'll be so rough, they'll be haulin'
dog tags back by the truckload."

00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:58.237
Shut up, Johnson. You're scarin' us
to death. It's the dyin' truth, son.

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:00.530
Hey, Murphy...

00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:03.788
I'd unfasten that chin
strap if I were you. Why?

00:25:03.794 --> 00:25:05.786
The first time a shell goes
off anywhere near you,

00:25:05.796 --> 00:25:08.880
the concussión will blow your
helmet off, your head with it.

00:25:11.552 --> 00:25:15.091
How do you keep it on?
<i>Half the time, you don't.</i>

00:25:21.812 --> 00:25:24.475
One of us better stick with
him when we hit the beach.

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:34.565
The way I see it, after we take Sicily,
we'll hit the Italian mainland.

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:36.827
That's when this war gets
real personal with me...

00:25:37.411 --> 00:25:39.528
because I'll be liberating
my ancestral home.

00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:43.114
Home? Weren't you born in Flatbush?
Sure, I was.

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:47.043
But my mother was born in Naples. I
promised her I'd look up the family.

00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:50.918
If I get there in one piece, I'll bet
they'll greet me like a conquering hero.

00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:54.342
Sure, they'll put your statue
right next to Mussolini's.

00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:57.421
I'm gonna fix you guys
spaghetti like you never

00:25:57.514 --> 00:26:00.131
had before, with my
own Valentino sauce.

00:26:01.602 --> 00:26:03.309
Hey, Kovak, will you
let me use your stove?

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.352
By George, you get your own.

00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:08.223
Everybody think they're so smart
they throw their stoves away.

00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:11.560
I keep mine. No, this
is for Chief and me.

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:14.020
<i>All right, you guys, check
your gear and get ready.</i>

00:26:16.158 --> 00:26:19.151
Come on, Little Texas.
You stick with me.

00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:41.006
How did you like the rough landing
Johnson was yellin' about?

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:43.508
He never got the right
dope in his life!

00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:47.516
Murphy, you see how lucky you
were to land in the 3rd?

00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:51.224
When theJerries heard this división
was comin', they headed for Berlin!

00:26:51.235 --> 00:26:54.524
Yeah, I'll bet. I never thought
the first day would be this easy.

00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:15.464
<i>They got the lieutenant.!</i>

00:27:15.843 --> 00:27:18.460
Steiner, take three men and
see what we're up against.

00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:20.628
Right.

00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:22.968
Johnson, Brandon, Murphy.

00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:43.113
Is it rough enough
for you yet, Murphy?

00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:48.331
I figure there's only one
machine gun up there.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.332
Right? Yeah.

00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:54.834
I'll get word back to Klasky.
Keep 'em busy.

00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:28.158
Where does he think he's going?

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:34.248
I'm supposed to
take care of him?

00:28:42.888 --> 00:28:44.880
Hey, you think you
got a private war?

00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:49.809
No, I think there's
enough to go around.

00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:01.320
Keep low, Brandon!

00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:27.342
Stay there!

00:30:01.883 --> 00:30:04.842
This more the way you figured the
first day would be like, Murph?

00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:08.513
Somewhat. Relax.

00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:11.679
Get through the first three or
four days, you'll be just like us.

00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:15.186
That's what it means to be a
veteran: You're scared all the time.

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:17.430
I didn't notice you
being too scared.

00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:19.182
Just crazy, standing
up like that.

00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:22.356
I had to take care
of you, didn't I?

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:32.695
<i>War, to the foot soldier,</i>

00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:35.372
<i>is a continual fight for
a few yards of dirt...</i>

00:30:35.459 --> 00:30:38.293
<i>that always seem to
lie ahead of him,</i>

00:30:38.462 --> 00:30:42.376
<i>to be taken from the enemy
or to be held at all costs.</i>

00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:45.962
<i>Why? As often as not
he doesn't know...</i>

00:30:46.053 --> 00:30:48.511
<i>in regard to the
overall campaign.</i>

00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:53.592
<i>On Sicily, all he knew was that he
took the entire island in 38 days.</i>

00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:56.143
<i>What he had accomplished
gave the Allies...</i>

00:30:56.146 --> 00:31:00.811
<i>a giant base of operation close
to the Italian mainland.</i>

00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:08.384
Hey, you guys, you know what we've
been doing the last few weeks?

00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:12.152
I want to forget. We've been
"advancing against light resistance...

00:31:12.245 --> 00:31:16.159
and squeezing the last of the enemy
forces off Sicily." What do you know!

00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:20.493
And our spirits are high! Speaking of high
spirits, you know what this jug cost?

00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:23.671
In Tennessee, I could have gotten a
fifth of bourbon... <i>3rd Platoon.!</i>

00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:25.665
On your feet!

00:31:26.593 --> 00:31:29.073
We got a new lieutenant. I hope
he's luckier than the last one.

00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:32.346
As you were, men. I'm
Lieutenant Manning.

00:31:32.933 --> 00:31:34.410
I've been told that
Sergeant Klasky here...

00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:36.642
has been handling the platoon
for quite a while now.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.103
He's been doing a good
job so there won't be

00:31:39.106 --> 00:31:41.314
any changes, at least
for the time being.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.687
Any news from up above, Lieutenant?
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:47.357
The 36th División and the British
10th Corps has landed at Salerno.

00:31:47.823 --> 00:31:51.863
They're having a rough go of it. Looks
like we're a cinch to be going across too.

00:31:51.952 --> 00:31:55.992
Why us? We took enough beatin' already.
The 36th is a Texas outfit.

00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:59.369
<i>Somebody's gotta
give them a hand.</i>

00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:02.313
They were doing all right till
they started draftin' you Yankees.

00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:05.671
At ease. I've got a
special order here.

00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:09.250
One promotion.
Murphy to corporal.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.387
I don't want any stripes.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.349
I didn't hear anybody ask you
if you wanted them or not.

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:18.676
All right, that's all.

00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:25.182
Why'd he pick on me?

00:32:25.485 --> 00:32:28.694
You ought to get the promotions. You've
been in this outfit longer than I have.

00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:30.730
When you've been in the
outfit as long as we have,

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.699
you learn how to avoid these things,
Corporal. Don't feel bad, Murph.

00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:37.362
We recommended you, so you
could lead us on to victory.

00:32:44.671 --> 00:32:46.913
Hey, you guys, welcome
to sunny Italy,

00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:49.085
the beautiful home
of my ancestors!

00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:53.048
How come there wasn't any brass
band to meet you back at the beach?

00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:55.178
When we hit Naples, I'll
get the big greeting,

00:32:55.182 --> 00:32:56.889
and you'll get your
spaghetti dinner.

00:32:57.434 --> 00:32:59.721
<i>How's it been going, Mac?</i>
Been a bit sticky.

00:32:59.936 --> 00:33:01.973
Glad to let you chaps
have a go at it.

00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:05.314
Looks like Jerry's making his
stand at the Volturno River.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.484
How do you know? The blokes
blew out the blasted bridges!

00:33:08.904 --> 00:33:11.817
Have a good time.
Yeah, thanks a lot.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.492
Sure looks peaceful, don't it?

00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:01.283
That's what I don't
like about it.

00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:03.823
If Jerry's over there,
he's sure invisible.

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.954
He's over there, all right.

00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:18.129
They've already blown
the bridge, Lieutenant.

00:34:20.642 --> 00:34:21.883
<i>Hey, Lieutenant.!</i>

00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:24.556
They want you for
battalion briefing.

00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:27.851
After dark we'll move down
close to the river and dig in.

00:34:29.985 --> 00:34:32.978
Gentlemen, our missión here
is a diversionary one.

00:34:33.613 --> 00:34:36.526
We're to make the enemy think that the
main effort will take place here.

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:39.658
Actually, the 7 th Regiment
will be the attacking force.

00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.823
They'll go across
upriver from us.

00:34:42.664 --> 00:34:45.156
Captain Marks, Baker Company
will start things off.

00:34:57.095 --> 00:35:01.965
River like this reminds me of an old
gal I knew in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.

00:35:02.726 --> 00:35:05.309
Had a pet seal. She was
a beautiful thing.

00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:08.183
- The seal?
- No, the girl.

00:35:15.864 --> 00:35:17.196
<i>Sure is quiet.</i>

00:35:18.158 --> 00:35:22.243
Jerry must know we're over here.
Be more natural if he opened up.

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.528
Why open up tonight
and get ten of us...

00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:27.494
when they can catch a hundred
in the middle of the river?

00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:36.257
It's none of my business, but
you got something on your mind?

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.043
It's nothin'.

00:35:40.472 --> 00:35:42.179
Thinkin' about home?

00:35:46.686 --> 00:35:48.552
Yeah.

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:53.061
About my little
girl, my ex-wife.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.069
Sometimes I think I got my
mind rid of her, but...

00:35:57.364 --> 00:36:00.402
when it gets quiet like this,
she keeps coming back.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.410
How come you busted up?

00:36:05.455 --> 00:36:08.323
We were still in school
when we got married.

00:36:08.917 --> 00:36:11.000
Then the baby came.

00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:15.083
I had to give up school
and work full-time.

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:21.836
I began blamin' them for all the big things
that I'd planned that weren't pannin' out.

00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:24.012
I just walked out on them.

00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:28.138
"Walked out on them"?
A guy with your guts?

00:36:29.104 --> 00:36:31.016
I sure did.

00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:35.482
Did she get married again?

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:40.359
I don't know why,
but she hasn't yet.

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:47.159
Sounds like maybe you ought to try
patching things up when you get back home.

00:36:48.748 --> 00:36:50.188
Maybe it's better
if I don't make it.

00:36:52.127 --> 00:36:54.210
Oh, knock off that kind of talk.

00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:56.545
<i>I fouled up once.</i>

00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:00.291
<i>Who can say I wouldn't foul up again
if she gave me another chance?</i>

00:37:00.927 --> 00:37:02.384
I'll say you wouldn't.

00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:07.632
Thanks, Murph.

00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:12.019
Say, what are your
postwar plans?

00:37:15.108 --> 00:37:17.976
I think I'll let the Army
do my planning for me.

00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:20.854
Think I'll stay in.
<i>Hey, Murphy.!</i>

00:37:21.614 --> 00:37:24.152
The lieutenant wants to see you.

00:37:24.743 --> 00:37:28.327
That Klasky... Learned
to whisper in a sawmill.

00:37:32.709 --> 00:37:36.123
We gotta get a combat patrol
across the river and stir Jerry up.

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:39.042
Do you think that squad
of yours can cut it?

00:37:39.549 --> 00:37:41.336
Give it a good try, sir.
All right.

00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:43.884
Move out as soon
as you're ready.

00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:57.223
What's goin' on?

00:37:58.735 --> 00:38:02.479
Nothin' much. What do you
mean, "Nothin' much"?

00:38:02.781 --> 00:38:05.649
Oh, I almost forgot. Klasky
wants to see you at the C.P.

00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:10.654
What about? I don't know, but you
better get yourself up there.

00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:38.828
<i>Get that flare.!</i>

00:39:44.507 --> 00:39:46.874
Back out of here!

00:40:03.026 --> 00:40:05.393
Open up!

00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:17.037
Klasky didn't want me. How come you left
me behind? 'Cause I got sentimental?

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:20.036
No, 'cause you take too many chances.
"Too many chances"?

00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:23.039
Look, you take care of you, and
I'll take care of me. Remember?

00:40:23.296 --> 00:40:26.539
I ought to let you freeze to death.
I might anyway.

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.018
Sounds like the
patrol worked, Murph.

00:40:44.525 --> 00:40:46.608
<i>They're really moving
motorized stuff in.</i>

00:40:46.694 --> 00:40:50.904
At 0500 we'll open up
with small arms fire.

00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:53.858
The 7 th will move
across at the same time.

00:40:55.745 --> 00:40:58.408
I'm sure theJerries will throw
some entertainment our way too.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.373
You can count on it, Lieutenant.
Yeah.

00:41:04.337 --> 00:41:08.047
Just sitting here being a target
isn't my idea of how to start a day.

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:13.552
You ever think of resigning?
Who'd win the war if I did?

00:42:47.607 --> 00:42:49.724
Baker Six, this is Baker Three.

00:43:21.057 --> 00:43:22.719
Medics!

00:43:27.146 --> 00:43:28.682
Get Klasky.

00:43:29.357 --> 00:43:31.519
He and Jones are both dead, sir.

00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:34.686
<i>Baker Three.! Baker Three.!</i>

00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:37.237
<i>Baker Three, this is Baker Six.!</i>

00:43:40.326 --> 00:43:42.363
Baker Three! Corporal
Murphy speaking!

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.744
Isn't Manning down
there now, Murphy?

00:43:45.915 --> 00:43:49.079
Lieutenant Manning's been hit pretty
bad, sir, and Sergeant Klasky's dead.

00:43:49.335 --> 00:43:51.292
You'll have to take
charge of the platoon.

00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:53.962
We're still taking a
pretty bad pounding, sir!

00:43:54.715 --> 00:43:56.877
Shall we pull back?
Stay where you are.

00:43:57.093 --> 00:44:00.427
Increase your fire if possible.
The 7 th is about ready to cross.

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.207
TheJerries have shifted the
artillery onto the 7 th.

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:37.464
However, they are across and
in good shape, so get moving!

00:44:37.466 --> 00:44:39.423
Yes, sir!

00:44:43.222 --> 00:44:45.714
The 7 th made it! Come on!

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:04.553
<i>For the next couple of months,</i>

00:45:04.577 --> 00:45:07.945
<i>the 3rd División continually
engaged the enemy.</i>

00:45:08.122 --> 00:45:11.331
<i>As usual, the foot soldier
wasn't concerned with why.</i>

00:45:11.626 --> 00:45:14.960
<i>His greatest concerns were
a vicious German defense,</i>

00:45:15.338 --> 00:45:17.921
<i>the fact that Italy was one
mountain after another...</i>

00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:21.000
<i>and that weather conditions
were impossible.</i>

00:45:21.636 --> 00:45:27.849
<i>These elements, combined, finally brought
the Allied advance to a stop at Cassino.</i>

00:45:48.162 --> 00:45:49.619
Hey, watch what you do!

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:54.370
Why don't you put a sign up?
I put a sign on your face!

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.372
All right, break it up, you two!

00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:02.215
We got enough trouble
without this kind!

00:46:02.718 --> 00:46:06.462
You clumsy fool.
Kick over my stove.

00:46:13.688 --> 00:46:16.008
We better keep an eye on Kovak.
He's gettin' a little edgy.

00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:19.020
He any different than the rest of us?
Who isn't?

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.274
<i>Look who's here.
Lieutenant Manning.!</i>

00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:28.692
Hello, Lieutenant. It's good to see you.
Kerrigan.

00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:31.240
We figured you'd be married
to a nurse by now.

00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:33.864
Good to have you back, sir. Thanks, Murphy.
Nice to be back.

00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:35.866
I've got some good
news for you men.

00:46:36.085 --> 00:46:38.623
We're moving back to a
rest area near Naples.

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.542
Naples! I was beginning to
think we missed it for good.

00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:44.003
Do they think we're
getting soft, Lieutenant?

00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:46.297
We've only been in the
line two months solid.

00:46:46.387 --> 00:46:50.222
I know. After medical inspections,
there'll be some passes.

00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:52.800
What do they think
we got, mud sores?

00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:54.871
A few weeks of
easy soldiering...

00:46:54.895 --> 00:46:56.852
while we get replacements
and new equipment.

00:46:57.106 --> 00:46:59.268
Then we're going to practice
up on amphibious tactics.

00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:01.983
What you think this is?

00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:06.818
I've got some more news for a
couple of you. Promotions.

00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:09.824
Murphy to sergeant. Hey, Sarge!

00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:13.738
Johnson to corporal. Did
you buck me into that?

00:47:14.707 --> 00:47:15.993
I have a request, sir.

00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:18.495
What is it? I'd like to
change to another squad.

00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:20.956
With Johnson heading this
one, the war is lost.

00:47:21.213 --> 00:47:22.670
Oh, yeah?

00:47:22.757 --> 00:47:26.501
Forget the war. Imagine,
12 hours in <i>bella Napoli.!</i>

00:47:26.594 --> 00:47:30.508
Oh, at the speed of one
woman per hour! Yow!

00:47:31.057 --> 00:47:32.889
You guys can have the town.
I'm gonna stay in

00:47:32.892 --> 00:47:35.009
camp and see what some
real sleep is like.

00:47:35.978 --> 00:47:37.344
Would you like my
mashed potatoes?

00:48:06.384 --> 00:48:09.344
There will be trucks leaving this corner
for camp tomorrow morning at 6:00.

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:12.671
If we're not here, don't wait for us, Mac.
We've got ground to cover.

00:48:12.973 --> 00:48:14.805
I sure wish I could
do the town with you,

00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:17.106
but I promised my mother
I'd look up her family.

00:48:17.186 --> 00:48:19.678
You really got relatives here?
Sure.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.584
You don't think I'd give my extra G.I.
Shoes to anybody else, do you?

00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:25.646
These are worth their weight in gold.
Take it easy.

00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:28.661
I'll see you in the morning. Good
luck, Val. All right, let's move out.

00:48:28.864 --> 00:48:33.325
Oh, pardon me! Sergeant
Murphy, CorporalJohnson.

00:48:38.457 --> 00:48:41.666
I can see Valentino now.
Big family reunion.

00:48:41.961 --> 00:48:44.328
Valentino kicks open the door,
tosses in the grenade...

00:48:44.422 --> 00:48:47.039
and then counts ten before
he enters the old homestead.

00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:51.714
By George, he do that! That only way
he know how go in house anymore!

00:48:53.472 --> 00:48:56.761
It should be right down the end of
this street and around the corner.

00:49:02.565 --> 00:49:05.478
Hey, Joe, no papa, no mama.

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:09.687
Hey, Joe, you want a fried egg?
You want a beef steak?

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.488
No, thank you. Hey,
you got a cigarette?

00:49:13.242 --> 00:49:15.108
You give me one cigarette?

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.531
You're too young to smoke.

00:49:17.997 --> 00:49:20.705
For my papa. One
cigarette for my papa.

00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:22.907
Hey, "no papa." Remember?

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.293
No cigarette? <i>No cigarette.</i>

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:29.502
How about this?

00:49:36.432 --> 00:49:38.389
How about you? You
want a chocolate?

00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:41.972
<i>No grazia.</i>

00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:49.859
Boy, they sure picked a great
time to be born, didn't they?

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:53.234
By George, they no start
Hitler's war. Look!

00:49:53.491 --> 00:49:55.904
<i>Look what it does to them.!</i>

00:49:57.203 --> 00:50:00.241
Well, we didn't start it either.
Let's get rolling.

00:50:00.372 --> 00:50:02.034
I don't want see this no more.

00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:06.125
It makes me think of Poland.
I go back camp.

00:50:06.378 --> 00:50:08.273
It'll do you good to blow off steam!
Come on, Kovak!

00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:10.710
I know what I want do!

00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:20.093
Got him pretty good, hasn't it?

00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:23.052
Let's not let it spoil things.
Let's go!

00:50:23.479 --> 00:50:25.220
You stick with me, Little Texas.

00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:27.556
Man, I invented women!

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:53.252
Hey, what is this? These fly-boys
got a corner on all the livestock?

00:50:53.676 --> 00:50:55.292
"Livestock"?

00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:58.591
Oh, aye! They're stationed here.

00:50:58.973 --> 00:51:00.680
And they got the
medals to charm 'em.

00:51:00.933 --> 00:51:03.676
Maybe the infantry can tear
that charm down a little.

00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:06.345

00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:05.369
Break it up! Come on!

00:52:06.415 --> 00:52:09.283
<i>Break it up.! Come on.!</i>

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:11.702
I said, "Break it up!"

00:52:14.006 --> 00:52:18.216
What's the matter? Don't you guys
get enough fighting at the front?

00:52:18.761 --> 00:52:20.878
All right, who started it?

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.600
He did.

00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:29.311
<i>He didn't like our singing.</i>

00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:31.353
All right, all right!

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.604
If he started it, how come you
were mixed up with the Air Corps?

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.899
"Mixed up with the Air Corps"?
Why, they're our pals! Yeah.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.896
That's right. We've been
sittin' here drinking.

00:52:40.115 --> 00:52:43.233
After he started the trouble, we
were so anxious to stay out of it,

00:52:43.327 --> 00:52:47.992
we all headed for the door at the
same time and got tangled up.

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:52.416
Don't let it happen again.
<i>Grazia.</i>

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:55.624
Man, that's what I call
a real joint operation!

00:52:55.631 --> 00:52:57.588
Drinks on the house!

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:06.006
<i>I can't find my hat.!</i>

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.558
Seven and three-quarters!

00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:16.357
No, I don't think so.
Come here, baby.

00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:18.685
He doesn't understand women.

00:53:18.779 --> 00:53:20.691
Here.

00:53:20.906 --> 00:53:22.706
She reminds me of an old
gal I knew back home.

00:53:22.783 --> 00:53:26.367
She was a real beaut. Comes up to
me in a U.S.O. Club in Nashville.

00:53:26.787 --> 00:53:28.699
Takes me ridin' in
a yellow roadster.

00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:31.247
We hit a curve doin'
65 miles an hour...

00:53:32.084 --> 00:53:33.370
and the cops take after us.

00:53:33.836 --> 00:53:35.543
Says she, "Don't..."

00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:40.545
"Don't say a word while I lay
the charm on these boys."

00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:51.058
Hello there.

00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:53.723
Can I have a shine, please?

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:58.933
All right.

00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:02.236
I don't seem to have
any money, but, uh...

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.527
how about this, huh? <i>Grazia.</i>

00:54:04.992 --> 00:54:06.528
Vincenzo!

00:54:09.621 --> 00:54:11.954
My brother do not beg, soldier.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.953
He wasn't begging. He did a
job for me, and I paid him.

00:54:15.043 --> 00:54:19.037
I see what you call job.
You do not let him finish.

00:54:19.673 --> 00:54:21.130
Oh, why don't you
let him have it?

00:54:21.216 --> 00:54:23.503
Here, I have enough for
all the children. No.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.349
Well, we tried anyway. Wait.

00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:34.640
There is no begging here, but...

00:54:35.022 --> 00:54:38.936
if you would like to share our food, then
the children can have your chocolate.

00:54:39.902 --> 00:54:41.313
You don't have to do that.

00:54:41.987 --> 00:54:46.698
If you are nice to the children, my
mother and I want to be nice to you.

00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:50.865
- Please stay.
- All right.

00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:54.660
It's a deal.

00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:16.790
I sure wish I knew
what she was saying.

00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:18.851
It was nothing. She was...
<i>Maria.</i>

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.657
Come. You go with us. Oh, no.

00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:40.994
I'm not spending my first
pass in some bomb shelter.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.177
Please, you can't stay here.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.900
You run along. As soon as the streets
clear, I'll head back for camp.

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:54.678
<i>Maria.!</i>

00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:19.829
Oh, this is just what
I've been needing.

00:56:21.712 --> 00:56:25.205
No, no, don't get
the wrong idea.

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:30.544
I've been looking for a long time
for somebody I could talk to,

00:56:30.637 --> 00:56:33.129
and you are it...

00:56:33.223 --> 00:56:38.014
because you can't
understand a word I say.

00:56:38.103 --> 00:56:41.062
<i>Si, si.</i>

00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:48.274
I want to talk about
my girl, the real one.

00:56:48.363 --> 00:56:52.323
She's gonna be my
wife if I get home.

00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:55.573
You see, I can't tell my
buddies about the real one.

00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:59.281
They'd have to make cracks about her and
say things that I don't want to hear,

00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:02.583
even if they are joking.

00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:05.787
Naw, I gotta make up
some wild ones...

00:57:05.881 --> 00:57:08.999
for the entertainment
of my buddies.

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:13.052
But you, I can
tell the truth to.

00:57:13.055 --> 00:57:16.594
Can't I? Can't I?

00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:21.849
You just keep it that way,

00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:26.104
'cause I'm gonna talk about
my girl all night long.

00:57:26.193 --> 00:57:29.937
I got an awful lot
to get off my chest.

00:57:32.908 --> 00:57:35.400
Well, what do ya know, a rug.

00:57:35.494 --> 00:57:39.738
I haven't rested my poor dogface
feet on a rug in two centuries.

00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:43.199
Man, I gotta lay my
feet on that rug.

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:48.254
You sit down. I pour your wine.
I sure will.

00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:53.255
Man, this is really livin'.

00:58:20.706 --> 00:58:23.574
You are crazy to stay here.

00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:27.418
How about you? Why
did you come back?

00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:30.247
I do not know.

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:39.680
I'm sorry I could not
talk to you before,

00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:44.974
but my mother does not like
for me to speak English.

00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:49.975
The English have killed my
older brother in Africa.

00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:54.146
Then she must have hated me too.
No, she do not hate.

00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:59.451
But when she hear English, she think
of her son she love very much.

00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:01.903
I'm sorry.

00:59:01.997 --> 00:59:06.162
I'm not anymore.
What good is it?

00:59:06.168 --> 00:59:09.661
One cannot feel sorry
for all who die.

00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:13.836
It's too much.

00:59:13.842 --> 00:59:17.335
My little brother, Vincenzo,
he like that sound.

00:59:17.345 --> 00:59:21.464
He say he is going to shoot
big gun when he grow up.

00:59:22.517 --> 00:59:24.679
I hope he doesn't have to.

00:59:27.064 --> 00:59:28.350
Where is your father?

00:59:29.066 --> 00:59:31.308
He went away when
bad times come.

00:59:32.736 --> 00:59:34.898
He never come back.

00:59:37.908 --> 00:59:40.321
Well, I guess we all
want to quit sometimes.

00:59:40.869 --> 00:59:44.533
It's hard not to take the easy way out
when it's right there in front of you.

00:59:45.207 --> 00:59:49.076
Why do we talk of bad things?
It is no good.

00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.128
Are you afraid?

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:05.091
All the time. I, too, am afraid,

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:09.512
but I am glad I come back.
I am too.

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:16.736
It can be so lonesome
when the bombs fall.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:22.359
When war is close, a woman
wants someone to hold.

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:36.609
<i>The family wanted you guys
for the spaghetti dinner...</i>

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.501
<i>after we got back from the bomb
shelter, but I couldn't find you.</i>

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.031
Hope we get you into camp before the M.P.
S spot you...

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.217
or you're gonna be in trouble.
Be in trouble?

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.515
Man, where do you
think I've been?

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:50.060
I was rolled by an expert. Takes an
expert to get old Kerrigan's shoes.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.764
I told you they were worth
their weight in gold.

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:56.602
Hey, Johnson, how come you're not
bragging up that old gal you were with?

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:59.319
Lost my voice. Must
have been bad wine.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:02.649
Hey, to keep you from talkin', I
wish I had a truckload of it.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:06.118
You should have stuck
with me, Murph.

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:09.114
You've gotta just quit
being scared of women.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.078
<i>There wasn't much time
to think about women...</i>

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.255
<i>because, in a few weeks,
the combined force...</i>

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.799
<i>of British, Canadian and American
units was landed at Anzio...</i>

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:25.797
<i>to bypass and cut off Cassino
and open the road to Rome.</i>

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:29.426
<i>A beachhead only seven miles
in depth was consolidated.</i>

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:33.809
<i>It took everything, including naval
gunfire support, to hold it...</i>

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:37.483
<i>because five crack Nazi divisions
were thrown against it,:</i>

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:41.946
<i>Divisions that otherwise would have opposed
the impending invasión of Normandy.</i>

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:02.466
Hey, who's Sergeant Murphy?

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.712
I'm Murphy. We're
your replacements.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:08.138
I'm Thompson. This is Saunders.
I'm Sanchez.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.695
Well, you men picked a
good time to come up.

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:12.973
Find yourself some cover.
I'll be right with you.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.482
They're blasting Johnson's squad
out of that house, Lieutenant.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:42.340
And thoseJerries will
be right on his tail.

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.717
Bronson, bring that
gun up here with me!

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:47.837
You men over there, cover 'em!
Give 'em fire!

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:19.253
Let's get out of here!

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:42.308
We'll never get out of here!
Take it easy!

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:44.485
We'll never get out of here!

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:47.196
Take it easy!

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.867
Get down!

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:40.459
Jennings, huh?

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.498
Yeah. Didn't last long, did he?

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.608
That farmhouse cost us
five casualties already.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:48.841
Who wants it anyway? Some general
lookin' for a place in the country?

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.960
Why don't you be
clever someplace else.

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:53.657
With Jerry holding all the high
ground, every company in the line...

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:57.425
fights for a two-story building for
observation purposes. Just asking.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.802
Sergeant Murphy!

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:03.018
Thompson, Saunders and
Sanchez, Johnson.

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.086
Best I can do for your squad.
What difference does it make?

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.710
I'm not gonna be here
to watch over them.

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:10.397
Feel like I'm gonna walk into one
for sure this time. Knock it off.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.823
<i>Ten to one, we jump off again.</i>

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.493
To hell and back, that's
where we're jumping off to.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.872
We've been in that farmhouse
five times, got knocked out six.

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.283
The law of averages got to
catch up with you sometime.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:30.045
This is Lieutenant Lee,
our new forward observer.

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:32.593
Just in from the beach. How
are things going there, sir?

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:35.046
It's under artillery fire and
dive-bombers all the time.

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:37.368
Men and equipment gettin'
to shore any better?

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:40.226
It's pretty rough. We've got to
hit that farmhouse again, Murph.

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:43.311
<i>German tanks have been spotted
moving into the area.</i>

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:46.599
Wouldn't take many to push us
right back into the ocean.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.979
If we can take that house in one piece, we
might be able to keep those tanks off you.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.161
We haven't had too much trouble with them.
They've been held to the road.

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:56.165
The fields have been too
muddy to support them.

01:05:56.661 --> 01:06:00.951
If it starts to rain again, I'll feel
better. We'll get ready to go, sir.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.750
I never thought I'd hear a
foot soldier ask for rain.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.215
I make some coffee, then, by George,
I go back, I kill all Germans.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:13.213
You better make it
good and strong.

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.420
All right, you guys, we got
to hit her again. Again?

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:17.721
What did I tell you? You new
men drop your packs here.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:21.221
Oh, sure.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.434
You all right? Yeah,
yeah, I'm fine.

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:29.642
When it cuts loose, stick with
us older men. "Older men"?

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:32.353
A couple of days, you'll
be as old as we are.

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.188
Okay, on your feet. Let's go.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:43.657
Set your gun up behind that
wall over there. Yes, sir.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:49.085
You men stick with
the first squad.

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:01.511
Keep working on that
second-story window.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.703
Murph! Murph! I'm hit!

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:33.748
Murphy!

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:40.053
Where is it? My back! I'm
bleedin' to death. I can feel it!

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:49.097
You clown, get moving. Murph, you can't
leave a man! They shot my back clean off!

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:52.524
All they did was spoil your lunch.
Well, I'll be a dirty men.

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.670
Hey, give me back my
Thompson, will you?

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:23.047
All right, you guys over
there, get ready to go!

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:25.995
You stay here and make sure those
artillery people get up there all right.

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:28.853
Hey, wait a minute!

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:44.534
Cover us, Johnson!
We're going in!

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:31.160
All right, you men! Get moving!
Come on!

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:29.515
Man, that's the first time I ever saw
a Texan beat himself to the draw.

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:38.354
You say one word about this to the other
guys, and I'll turn this loose on you.

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:40.817
Don't you go blabbing either.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:49.322
That machine gun's on the other
side of the house. Let's go get it!

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:12.891
Kovak, hurry up!

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:29.533
It's no use, Chief. You'll
get yourself killed too.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.792
What's going on? He'll be all
right in a minute. Kovak.

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:54.216
Must be the same gun that got Lieutenant
Manning. We'd better get it, Murph.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:58.429
Stay right where you are. Our orders
were to take this house and hold it.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.569
Why did Manning have
to come back anyway?

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:09.065
He didn't have to come back.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:11.863
I guess he figured the
platoon needed him.

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:36.600
Crank that thing up before
they blast us out of here!

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:42.644
Red nine! Red nine! Five tanks
attacking near eastern junction!

01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:47.398
Coordinates: 4-1-8-6-0-3!
Situation urgent!

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:54.322
Fifty short, 200 right!

01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:07.251
One hundred right!

01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:19.802
That's good shootin',
Lieutenant.

01:13:23.608 --> 01:13:25.144
With that tank blocking
the road, they can't

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:26.938
get to us, as long as
the field's muddy.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.243
I sure wish it would rain.

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:46.537
Kovak was sure a good soldier.

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:52.293
You'd have thought he was fightin'
a holy war. Maybe he was.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:56.680
Are you nuts? What
did he have to save?

01:13:56.766 --> 01:14:00.180
Not even a citizen. His whole
family liquidated in Poland.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:03.554
Then maybe he didn't mind dyin'.

01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:06.982
Maybe that's what fightin'
for a cause means.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:10.443
<i>Something none of us
really understands.</i>

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:16.400
Look what I found! A stove!
Now we can have some coffee!

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:19.574
<i>Takes a new guy to take
care of you fellows.</i>

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.783
Wait a minute!

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:34.085
Let him alone! You expect me
to take that kind of stuff?

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:38.548
What's the matter with him?
You'll find out... sometime.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:21.598
Sarge, can you hear that
clanking noise out there?

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:30.270
Yes, sir, Jerry was sure nice to let us
borrow the house from him for the night.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.269
Now tomorrow, if he wants
it back just a little bit,

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:37.023
he'll wake us up with some of that 88
millimeter stuff; you know, small caliber.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:40.908
If he wants it back real bad,
he'll open up old Annie.

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:44.913
Rumor says its barrel is just short
of a quarter of a mile long,

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:48.333
can use old railroad cars for shells
and a pile driver for a ramrod.

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:51.669
Did you tell them about that bean
can that won you the Purple Heart?

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:54.999
Um, yeah, I was just
gettin' around to it.

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:56.792
Three machine guns
lined up on me...

01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:00.220
You three guys just volunteered
to go fight a tank. What?

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:02.134
I heard them working on
that one that got hit.

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:04.133
If they get it off
that road, we're sunk.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:06.305
Anything to get
away from this guy.

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:09.271
I better tag along so you won't
miss the ending. Oh, no, you don't.

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:12.641
Probably see that
the Jerries heard it too.

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:15.148
I'll go, Sarge. <i>Me too.</i>

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:18.488
We don't need you.

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:28.327
What's eating him? He was
friendly enough this morning.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.330
Does he have to snap our heads off
just 'cause we offer to go with him?

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:35.164
He doesn't want you for friends.
That's why he did it.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:39.551
You see, when you guys have been
in the line as long as we have,

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:42.341
you find out it's no
good to make friends.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:47.347
Because when a friend gets
it, well, it's rough on you.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.762
The buddies that come
with you, you're stuck

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:52.518
with, but you don't
make no new ones.

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:56.105
It's the dyin' truth.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:10.786
They've got a machine
gun on the right.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.785
You stay here and cover me.
Less chance of noise.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:15.836
Hey... Shh.

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:18.961
As soon as I open up on those
tracks, let 'em have it.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:15.434
Hey, you guys keep
your eyes open.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:18.434
Those fields are really
drying up out there.

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:24.030
Captain. Nice work
last night, Murphy.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:26.358
I'm recommending you
for a decoration.

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:28.819
Well, there were three
other men with me, sir.

01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:31.621
Yes, I know. They
told me the story.

01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:37.789
Coffee, Captain?

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:45.426
Hope you can take it black.
Thanks.

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.504
I've been talking
to Colonel Howe.

01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:49.510
We want you to take a
battlefield commissión.

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:52.308
Oh, no, sir. I
couldn't do that, sir.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.306
You couldn't?

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:57.810
No, sir. I'm not qualified.
What do you mean?

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:02.982
Education, for one thing. Another is
I'd have to transfer from the outfit.

01:19:03.864 --> 01:19:07.608
That's the rule in this división, but
I still think you should take it.

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:11.824
I couldn't transfer, sir.
Why not?

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:14.643
It's a hard thing to answer. Murph,
they're moving up tanks and infantry!

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:17.876
They're trying to
use the fields!

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:24.250
<i>Lousy break, those
fields drying out.</i>

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.196
Pull back to the old positions.

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.553
I'll contact the other platoons.
Yes, sir.

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:33.096
Lieutenant Lee, we're
pulling out of here!

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:37.349
Come on! Get ready to go!

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.586
You did right turnin' down lieutenant.
Don't ever take it.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.353
If you do, I hope you get your
can shot off! Thanks a lot!

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.545
Hey, Murph, looks like you'll
be up for retirement...

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:14.015
before we get off this beach.
Don't bank on it!

01:20:19.606 --> 01:20:20.722
What's the matter with Johnson?

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:23.066
Don't this remind him of some
old gal he used to know?

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:28.606
Hey, what is wrong with you?

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:30.902
Just a scratch.

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:34.111
A silly, little scratch.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:39.328
It's the dyin' truth.

01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:53.220
For one lousy farmhouse.

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:01.601
The trouble is makin' friends,

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:05.604
learnin' to love guys
like Kovak and Johnson.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.320
Well, isn't it?

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.439
I'm sure you'll all agree that
the four months here on Anzio...

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:26.625
have been the longest
of your lives.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.957
The enemy has played
host with a vengeance.

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:32.715
Every time we've gotten a división
ashore, he's moved two in to face it.

01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:35.805
But we've finally gained the
balance of power over him.

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:38.735
The 1 st Armored División's been
landed, and we're going to break out.

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.302
We're going all the way to Rome.

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:44.185
<i>We'll have strong air cover. We'll
mark our own position with red smoke.</i>

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.483
H- Hour is 0500. Good
night, gentlemen.

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:52.313
Captain Marks?

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:55.822
You're still short a second lieutenant.
I'll see what I can do about it.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:57.820
I'd rather not have
a new man, sir.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.368
Murphy's one of the best
platoon leaders I've ever had.

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:02.369
Then why won't he
take a commissión?

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:05.372
Something about not wanting
to take responsibility.

01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:09.168
He's mixed up because, instinctively,
he does take it all the time.

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:12.501
The main reason is he doesn't
want to be transferred.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.673
Maybe we can do
something about that.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:17.172
Good luck, Marks.
Thank you, sir.

01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:22.803
Look what's coming!

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:26.098
<i>Oh, you beautiful dolls.!</i>

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:33.835
<i>I'll lay you two to one, the
Chief traps one. You got a bet.</i>

01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:36.464
<i>Hey, you guys, get
a load of this.</i>

01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:39.463
"Normandy beaches
fully consolidated.

01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:43.475
Allied forces continue advance."
They're doing all right.

01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:46.206
It figures we'd miss that landing.
Must have been a breeze.

01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:48.313
I heard a couple of
officers talking.

01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:50.640
With things going so
good in Normandy, we're

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.817
gonna stay right here
and garrison Rome.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:55.316
No kiddin'? What's the
matter with going home?

01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:57.647
Home? With all these Rome women?

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:01.822
Here comes Murph and
the new 90-day wonder.

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:08.120
Men, this is Lieutenant Burns.
Rest.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:10.827
You picked a good time to
join us, Lieutenant. Oh?

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:13.413
I got it from a good source,
we're gonna garrison Rome.

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:15.464
I've got it from
a better source,

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:18.342
we're on orders to move to the coast
tomorrow for amphibious training.

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:20.883
More of that? I feel like
I got webbed feet now.

01:24:20.973 --> 01:24:23.181
I thought the Marines were
the amphibious experts.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:25.475
They are, but we're the
only Marines in Italy.

01:24:25.477 --> 01:24:29.687
Any idea where we're goin', sir?
Could be southern France.

01:24:30.607 --> 01:24:32.974
<i>It was southern France.</i>

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:35.318
<i>For the fourth time
in Worid War II,</i>

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.030
<i>the 3rd División was about
to land on a hostile shore.</i>

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:47.997
<i>But this time the foot soldier
knew why he was there.</i>

01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:52.160
<i>He knew the enemy, being closed
in on from two sides in France,</i>

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:54.997
<i>was now falling back
toward his own border.</i>

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:58.049
<i>He knew the sooner the enemy
was pushed into Germany,</i>

01:24:58.051 --> 01:25:00.168
<i>the sooner the war
would be over.</i>

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:03.801
<i>And this was all he lived for.</i>

01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:26.035
How bad is he? He'll go home.

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:28.738
You got the million-dollar
wound, Chief.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:32.830
Hey, you timed that just right.

01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:35.002
You only had one left.

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:41.217
See what chance we have to
flank that hill. Yes, sir.

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:43.754
<i>Take a radio so we can be in contact.
Yes, sir.</i>

01:25:48.518 --> 01:25:51.477
You three men right here, you with
the extra radio, come with me.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:26.262
Brandon, this is Burns.
Over. Brandon!

01:26:27.974 --> 01:26:31.968
I can't contact Brandon. Do you think
I ought to send up another patrol?

01:26:31.978 --> 01:26:35.267
Why don't you give me about
ten minutes to check first?

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:37.523
All right. Go ahead.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:54.874
Sure caught us cold, Murph.
Yeah.

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:58.085
See if you can get him
on down the hill.

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:14.640
Are you trying to win yourself a wooden
cross? I told you to get down the hill.

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:18.098
Thought you might need this. Think
you've got a corner on this real estate?

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:24.403
Come on. They can kill us, but they
can't eat us. That's against the law.

01:27:45.135 --> 01:27:46.626
That did it!

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:49.929
Get down Brandon!

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:59.522
Why didn't you stay down?
Murph...

01:30:57.327 --> 01:31:00.365
Come on, Murph, before the rear
echelon catches up with us.

01:31:18.723 --> 01:31:21.716
We're being pressured by
División for being held up.

01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:25.766
We've got to get that German artillery
off of us so we can push through.

01:31:25.772 --> 01:31:28.765
They have an observation
post somewhere on Hill 481.

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:31.225
I can back you up with a
couple of pieces of armor.

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:33.819
Send a platoon out, and get rid of it.
Right, sir.

01:31:34.197 --> 01:31:36.564
You sent for Murphy?
He's on his way, sir.

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:39.401
He can't turn it down this time.
Did you know he was turned down...

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:41.907
by the Navy, the Marines
and the paratroops?

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:44.113
It's not so funny, sir.

01:31:44.207 --> 01:31:46.415
I tried to get him transferred
out of the company...

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:49.869
as being unfit for combat.
<i>Sergeant Murphy's here, sir.</i>

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:57.051
Sir, Sergeant Murphy reports to Battalion
Commander as ordered. At ease, Murphy.

01:31:57.595 --> 01:32:01.714
- How would you like to go to West Point?
- West Point?

01:32:01.808 --> 01:32:06.678
He means it. Quite a few men who have shown
special qualifications are being picked.

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:09.855
<i>I talked it over at Regimental, and
we think you ought to be one of them.</i>

01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:13.692
You'll never find a
better break than this.

01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:19.987
Sir, it's true I've decided
to stay in the Army, but...

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:24.867
West Point. I'm not
qualified for it, sir.

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:28.165
I didn't even finish grade school.
<i>The courses you took...</i>

01:32:28.168 --> 01:32:31.161
<i>and the coaching we can give
you will get you through.</i>

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:34.122
After we move through the Colmar
area, we'll get things rolling.

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:37.549
In the meantime, you'll
take a commissión.

01:32:37.635 --> 01:32:39.968
But, sir, how about... You
won't have to transfer.

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:43.594
With the replacement shortage being
what it is, the rule has been waived.

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:46.179
You are now a gentleman
by act of Congress.

01:32:46.269 --> 01:32:48.727
Take a bath, shave...

01:32:48.813 --> 01:32:53.023
Well, anyway, take a bath and
get back into the lines.

01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:55.021
Thank you, sir.

01:32:55.028 --> 01:32:57.896
Congratulations.
Thank you, Captain.

01:32:58.615 --> 01:33:02.154
Why is it always the 3rd
División that takes the beating?

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:05.987
Yeah, and the closer we get to the German
border, the tougherJerry's gonna be.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:08.030
You mean they can get tougher?

01:33:08.041 --> 01:33:10.829
With somebody moving in on
the States, wouldn't you?

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:18.791
You see what I see?

01:33:18.885 --> 01:33:20.842
Well, what do ya know!

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:29.097
Well, congratulations. It's time
you took it, <i>sir</i>. Shavetail.

01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:32.142
I still say you're gonna get
shot right in the... At ease.

01:33:33.817 --> 01:33:36.434
Take your cotton-pickin'
hands off me.

01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:39.612
From now on, there'll be a little more
respect shown second lieutenants.

01:33:39.697 --> 01:33:41.609
Yes, sir. And another thing,

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:43.649
I want to thank you two
for all the buckin'

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:45.868
you've been doing for me
over the past two years.

01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:49.284
Ah, don't mention it, Murph.
Ah, forget it, Murph.

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:53.118
Forget it? Just when I'm in
a position to repay you?

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:56.545
You take over the platoon,
<i>Sergeant</i> Kerrigan.

01:33:56.631 --> 01:34:00.466
But I don't want the rank. I don't deserve
it. Give it to one of the other guys.

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:02.669
I didn't hear anyone
ask you, soldier.

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:06.265
All right.

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:09.763
That's what I like in
enlisted men: Spirit.

01:34:11.271 --> 01:34:13.809
<i>Sergeant</i> Kerrigan.

01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:16.273
What are you laughing
about, <i>Corporal?</i>

01:34:16.359 --> 01:34:18.646
Huh? Oh, not me, Murph.

01:34:22.282 --> 01:34:25.150
Get the platoon ready to move out.
Yes, sir.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.416
I'm Murphy. Pierce.

01:34:34.419 --> 01:34:37.583
They brief you back at headquarters?
Just generally.

01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:41.590
That German observation post
that's breaking our back...

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:44.339
seems to be located along this
ridge about five miles up.

01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:46.636
It's up to us to take
him out of there.

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:49.758
All right, you men, from here
on down, get on the first tank.

01:34:49.851 --> 01:34:52.434
The rest of you take the second.

01:34:56.983 --> 01:35:01.227
As Platoon Sergeant, I will assume my
proper position. Your hand, please.

01:35:05.658 --> 01:35:10.323
Be my guest, Corporal Valentino.
Thank you, Sergeant Kerrigan.

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:17.623
Hey, Lieutenant, you tankers
have really got it soft.

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:19.541
This is the way to
travel, with a hundred

01:35:19.631 --> 01:35:21.793
thousand dollars worth
of machinery under you.

01:35:21.883 --> 01:35:24.125
If we run into German
Tigers, you won't think so.

01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:27.799
This thing's only got about
four inches of armor. Oh, yeah?

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:31.849
Say, how thick do you think this G.I.
Shirt is?

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.082
Sergeant Kerrigan,
have the men dismount.

01:36:01.172 --> 01:36:04.006
All right, you guys, bail out!

01:36:12.892 --> 01:36:15.726
Valentino, get those men out of here!
Move out!

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:20.852
See what promotion does to you.
You lucky son of a gun.

01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:23.359
Looks like somebody just
handed you a ticket home.

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:26.733
Who wants to go home? And I
was getting used to the rank.

01:36:35.581 --> 01:36:37.368
Just to the right
of those trees!

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:39.495
Can you get a few
rounds in there?

01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:02.690
Murphy. Lieutenant Black. I
brought him down to help you out.

01:37:02.942 --> 01:37:03.942
Black. How are you?

01:37:04.027 --> 01:37:06.269
You're gonna take
over the company.

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:11.945
Captain Marks, sir? His jeep hit a mine.
He's busted up pretty bad.

01:37:12.035 --> 01:37:15.244
We're moving into the
Colmar area immediately.

01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:17.242
The battalion objective
is this wooded area...

01:37:17.332 --> 01:37:19.449
on the outskirts of Holtzwihr.

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:22.535
It's heavily defended because it's
Jerry's last foothold in France.

01:37:23.463 --> 01:37:25.783
You can expect them to throw
everything they've got at you,

01:37:25.882 --> 01:37:27.669
but it's got to be
taken at all costs.

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:30.877
When this city's reduced, there's nothing
between us and the German border.

01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:35.135
Able Company will be on your right
flank, Charlie on your left.

01:37:35.224 --> 01:37:39.685
Be in position here at 0600 and
ready to jump off. Yes, sir.

01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:42.809
Good luck. Thank you, sir.

01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:59.534
Colonel Howe? Sir, we're
on our objective,

01:37:59.624 --> 01:38:03.243
but I haven't been able to contact
the companies on either flank.

01:38:03.336 --> 01:38:06.545
Artillery's delayed
them temporarily.

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:10.628
Any change in orders? No,
you'll attack in ten minutes.

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:13.131
You'll get your support.
Yes, sir.

01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:15.338
Get the men ready to jump off.

01:38:15.848 --> 01:38:17.259
Yes, sir.

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:43.790
Should we dig in? Too
late for that now.

01:38:46.504 --> 01:38:48.264
We'll never be able to
stay here with 30 men.

01:38:48.339 --> 01:38:50.831
Pull back and tie in with "A" Company.
What about you?

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:53.175
I'm gonna see if I can get
some artillery working.

01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:56.095
Better knock on it.

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:58.513
You two get out of here.

01:39:03.896 --> 01:39:06.889
Artillery, I need a
round of smoke...

01:39:06.983 --> 01:39:10.476
at coordinate 3-0-5-6-0-1!

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:13.528
What are you up against?
Five tanks that I can see...

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:16.027
and two reinforced
rifle companies.

01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:18.070
Tell thoseJoes to
get the lead out!

01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:25.040
One hundred short, 50
right, and fire for effect!

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:34.796
You're right on the nose!
Keep it coming!

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.677
Keep it coming! Keep it coming!

01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:05.990
That's good shootin'! The
tanks are heading for cover!

01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:14.590
Give me a correction! Let's
stay on those tanks!

01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:17.926
Never mind the tanks! Let's
keep after that infantry!

01:40:22.099 --> 01:40:25.467
Are we too close to you?
Keep firing for effect!

01:40:31.025 --> 01:40:35.065
How close are they? Hold the
phone, I'll let you talk to them!

01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:04.385
He's got more guts than sense!

01:41:04.475 --> 01:41:06.555
That tank is loaded with gas and ammo!
It'll blow up!

01:41:08.312 --> 01:41:11.680
Murph, get outta there! Murph!

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.465
Murphy, are you... Keep
'em rollin', Black!

01:42:14.503 --> 01:42:16.711
Medic! Medic, over here!

01:42:20.301 --> 01:42:21.528
I'm all right, Val. Get movin'.

01:42:21.552 --> 01:42:23.464
You crazy Irishman,
you ought to be dead!

01:42:23.554 --> 01:42:26.467
Well, I'm not, so get movin'!

01:42:26.557 --> 01:42:31.097
Okay, I'll see you, Murph.
Take care of yourself.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.893
And you still owe me
a spaghetti dinner!

01:42:45.076 --> 01:42:48.490
Hey, Murph... uh, sir. You aren't
supposed to be in this ward.

01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:50.662
I know, sir, but I've got
to see my old buddy.

01:42:50.748 --> 01:42:53.206
You're liable to get into trouble.
Sir, if I have to,

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:54.370
I can prove I'm a
bird colonel from

01:42:54.377 --> 01:42:58.587
Intelligence in disguise.
You shanty Irishman.

01:42:58.673 --> 01:43:00.756
I figured you'd be on your
way back to the States.

01:43:00.841 --> 01:43:02.878
No, not for a while yet.

01:43:03.219 --> 01:43:05.381
Where'd you get it?

01:43:05.971 --> 01:43:10.591
In the hip. Wha... But
where did it come out?

01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:13.594
You know where it came out.

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:15.930
I told him where he was gonna get it.
Didn't I tell ya?

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.182
Sergeant, you'll have to leave.

01:43:18.275 --> 01:43:20.232
Look, sir, he's a
friend of mine.

01:43:20.569 --> 01:43:23.607
When he goes to West Point, I'm gonna
open a bar right across the street.

01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:27.907
<i>What's the matter?</i>

01:43:29.286 --> 01:43:30.527
What's wrong with a bar?

01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:33.450
His wound's going to keep
him out of West Point.

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:35.991
<i>It will probably put
him out of the Army.</i>

01:43:40.256 --> 01:43:44.250
Gee, I'm sorry to hear that, Murph.
It doesn't matter.

01:43:44.343 --> 01:43:48.132
You're probably better off anyway. Let
'em bust you right back to civilian.

01:43:48.139 --> 01:43:50.256
You'll be in big demand
back in the States.

01:43:50.349 --> 01:43:53.842
You can pick off a man at
500 yards with an M-1,

01:43:53.936 --> 01:43:56.373
You can toss a grenade further than
anybody in the neighborhood...

01:43:56.397 --> 01:43:58.309
and you can bathe
in ditch water!

01:43:58.399 --> 01:44:00.891
Sergeant, roll up your sleeve.

01:44:00.985 --> 01:44:04.649
At least I can quiet you down so
my patients can get their rest.

01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:07.648
Okay, sir. I was just leaving.

01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:10.780
I'll be back and see you
later, Murph, uh, sir!

01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:15.163
