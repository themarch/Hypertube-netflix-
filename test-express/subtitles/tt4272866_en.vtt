00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.680
What a troublesome bunch you are.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.000
But if you really wanna know, we'll tell you.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.010
Take a seat there and listen up.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.840
A long time ago, but not really that long ago.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.880
This is about a little while ago.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.450
There are many cities in the world of beasts.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:12.070
As many as 100,000 beasts live in the remarkably busy Juutengai.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.630
The grandmaster who's been leading them for a long time,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.270
announced that he'd retire and reincarnate as a god.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730
He didn't know what kind of god he wanted to become,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.400
but he allowed a successor to be chosen.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.620
He told everyone to prepare for this.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.820
Strength and dignity were obvious requirements.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.760
A beast called Iouzen made a name for himself right away.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.460
He's a great person who's calm, brave, and has lots of disciples.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.360
He's also the father of two children, Ichirouhiko and Jiroumaru.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.190
"He'll surely be the next grandmaster",

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.350
is what everyone was saying.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.100
But there was another candidate.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.640
His name was Kumatetsu.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.180
As his name suggests, he looked like a bear,
was swift like a monkey, possessed bottomless strength,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.990
and wielded his sword masterfully.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.120
When it came to strength,
he was said to surpass even Iouzen.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.960
By the way, this guy was a bit troublesome.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.780
He was violent, selfish, disrespectful, didn't have a single disciple,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.570
let alone any children.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.420
Let's go.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.090
Don't touch me!

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.920
You're minors, right?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.650
We aren't!

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.510
You ran away from home, didn't you?

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.940
Like I said, we didn't!

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.710
Oh, indeed.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.900
A baby mouse?

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.680
Still, you're so tiny.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.810
Just a sec.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.280
Here.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.800
Eat it.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.540
Did you run away from somewhere, too?

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.460
I'm all alone, too.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.810
All right, let's take this.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.970
Okay.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.990
This one goes there.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.640
Dad, where are you?

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.620
What are you doing?

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.530
Why aren't you here at a time like this?

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.280
Ren, it's time to go.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.810
Um, what about this?

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.990
Ah, we'll take that ourselves.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.910
Oh...

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.370
Ah, be careful.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.010
Ren, I know you're lonely after suddenly loosing your mum,

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.300
but it can't be helped, it was an accident.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.980
The head family will take you in.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.940
All right?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.960
You're our family's only boy and precious successor.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.730
We'll raise you, so there's nothing to worry about.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.220
Ren, answer if you understand!

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.530
Why didn't dad come?

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.310
Forget about him.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.110
Why?

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.240
He's my dad.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.440
Don't you already know that your mum divorced him?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.660
Plus, the courts gave us full custody of you.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.080
He's just an outsider now.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.960
I'll just live by myself then.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.870
Hmph, you're just a kid.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.030
You obviously can't do that.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.910
I'll live by myself.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.470
I'll become strong and get you all back for this!

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.150
How can you talk like that?!

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.270
Ren, you're-

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.260
I hate you!

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.800
You and dad... I hate all of you!

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.930
Ren, wait! Ren!

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.360
I hate you...

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.280
I hate you...

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.580
I hate you... I hate you...

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.000
I hate you!

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.890
I hate you.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.560
I hate... you...

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.420
Chiko?

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.660
I'm all right, thanks.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.140
Geez, what's with that?

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.680
I just have to be stronger than Iouzen, right?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.750
Dignity? What does that even mean?

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.400
The grandmaster is asking for a bit too much there.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.080
How long did it take for the previous one to run away?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.450
A month...

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.600
A week?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.500
A day...

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.230
He was gone by noon!

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.270
I hate whiny people like that!

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.460
Can you afford to be picky?

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.590
At this rate, you'd be better off taking a random human or broom as your disciple.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.590
Is that so?

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.170
Got it.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.360
Hey, I was just joking! Don't take it seriously!

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.660
Hey!

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.580
I said, hey!

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.330
Are you alive or dead?

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.050
Shut up.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.730
If you can talk, I guess that means you're alive.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.010
Where's your mum?

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.250
Shut up.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.150
What about your dad?

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.760
Shut up.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.460
Answer me!

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.230
Where's your dad?

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.180
Shut up!

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.230
If you keep talking, I'll kill you!

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.110
Who're you killing, brat?

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.480
Let me see your face.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.950
A b...

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.790
A beast...

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.020
Not bad.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.320
That's enough, don't you think?

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.220
You wanna come with me?

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.050
Eh?

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.180
Huh?!

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.010
S-Stop saying stupid things, Kumatetsu!

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.720
What was that?

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.660
A dream?

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.720
Hey you, did you run away from home?

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.250
L-Let go!

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.720
Children shouldn't be out in the dead of the night.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.960
Let go of me!

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.390
What's your guardian's phone number?

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.850
We'll have them pick you up.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.210
No...

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.750
Let's go.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.190
Absolutely... not!

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.120
Wait!

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.240
Hey, wait!

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.570
Stop!

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.450
Hey!

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.950
Where'd he go?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.270
Over there?

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.770
No, this way!

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.110
Is this really Shibuya?

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:18.870
Huh?

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.000
Huh?

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:26.960
Huh?!

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.210
Ow...

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.490
Huh?

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.910
They way I just came from is gone!

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.840
The way out... Where's the way out?

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.130
Let go!

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.250
What's this?

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.750
It's a human child.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.930
Why is it here?

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.280
This is perfect, let's tear off his skin and sell it to the lute maker.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.180
Maybe we should dry him out and shave off bits for bonito flakes.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.590
Or...

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.190
H-Help!

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.760
Stop it, you idiots!

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.360
Huh?

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.250
Don't say wicked things like that.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.480
He's acting all high and mighty.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.560
Don't let it bother you.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.670
They just look and talk a bit rough, that's all.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.620
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.410
I'm Hyakushuubou.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.700
As you can see, I'm a monk.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:37.110
You can't come to Juutengai unless you follow the exact route.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:42.510
We beasts who can even become gods,
and you humans who can't, live in different worlds.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.460
Coming here by accident must have been scary.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.670
Come with me, I'll lead you back to your world.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.940
Yo!

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.730
You actually came?

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.230
Ah!

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.090
I knew you had something in you!

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.570
I'm starting to like you!

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.860
Come here!

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.410
What are you doing?

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.660
He's a lost child, be gentle!

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.630
Gentle?

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.050
All you monks do is spout off such nonsense.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.080
I'm telling you to not be rough!

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.980
What's wrong with being rough?!

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.040
And he isn't lost.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.280
Starting now, he's my disciple!

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.050
Disciple?

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.220
I told you already.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:19.970
You forgot?

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.970
You're taking a human child as your disciple?!

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.470
It doesn't matter whether it's a human or a broom!

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.470
A disciple is a disciple!

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.960
Hold on!

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.270
Didn't I tell you multiple times not to do it?

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.330
Tatara, explain what's going on.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:38.030
The grandmaster told him he must
have a disciple if he wants to be the successor.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.760
But unlike in Iouzen's case, no one wants to be his disciple.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.060
And just when we were sightseeing the pitiful humans,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.490
we found this brat.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.250
So you kidnapped him?!

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.000
He followed us all by himself.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.330
That's no reason to get a stranger involved!

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.230
Are you saying I can't set my sights on anyone I think's got potential?!

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.010
Huh?!

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.090
Hey!

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.160
He's so unreasonable.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.970
Does he want to be the successor that badly?

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.160
No, no.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.280
He only wants to win a fight against Iouzen.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.500
That's all.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:21.510
Indeed, becoming the grandmaster and
reincarnating as a god doesn't seem to interest him.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.450
Even if he became a god,

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.190
"god of tool"
he'd probably be a tsukumogami at best.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.280
Maybe a toilet god, or a broom god.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.260
It's the human child I'm worried about.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.960
Do you think it'll be okay to leave him with Kumatetsu?

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.100
Who knows.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.400
Not my problem.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.280
What do you mean by disciple?

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.440
It means I'll be providing for you from now on.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.440
It's not like I asked you to.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.240
You sleep there.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.440
However, I hate whiny people.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.210
If you cry, I'll throw you out.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.240
I won't cry.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.610
That's the way!

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.510
That doesn't mean I've agreed to become your disciple.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.560
Then why did you follow me?

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.800
Why...

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.720
Even if you don't answer, I can tell.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.410
You've got nowhere else to go.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.270
Are you pitying me?

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.610
You idiot!

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.240
You can only say that after you've become an adult!

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.440
You'll have to keep living alone anyway.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.740
I don't know your name yet.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.030
I'm not telling you.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.990
Huh?

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.620
It's personal information.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.110
Fine! And your age?

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.520
"Kyuu"
Nine...

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.960
"ninth boy"
All right, from now on, you're Kyuuta!

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.200
Why do you get to give me a name?

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.130
It's Kyuuta from now on, okay?

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.510
Well then, I'm going to sleep, Kyuuta.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:31.960
Ren.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.750
I made your favourite ham omelette.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.040
Eat it before it gets cold.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:41.920
Okay.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.040
So he ran away.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.600
I knew this would happen...

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.770
He must have really disliked his new name!

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.590
It's time for breakfast!

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.110
Stop it!

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.070
Still angry?

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.010
I was just messing around a little.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.150
Cheer up and eat.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.750
These are fresh eggs.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.110
Not eating them raw is a waste.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.110
Or are you not hungry?

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.320
I am!

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.200
Then eat!

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.550
Raw eggs are...!

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.860
Huh?

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.460
They're gross, who'd eat them!

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.960
Everyone does!

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.570
Look, like this!

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.490
See?

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.890
That's just stupid.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.260
What was that?!

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.930
I forbid my disciple to be a picky eater!

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.560
I'm not your disciple!

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.850
Shut up and eat!

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:23.930
I won't!

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.350
If you're hell-bent on not eating...

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.770
What are you gonna do?

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.700
I'll stuff them in your mouth!

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.970
Stop it, Kumatetsu.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.230
Be kind.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.860
You get it now, don't you, Kumatetsu?

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.880
Just send that brat back home.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.660
Huh?

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.530
Where'd he go?

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.620
I hate you!

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.940
Wait right there!

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.900
Kyuuta!

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.710
Kyuuta?

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.670
Hey!

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.400
Who'd wanna become your disciple?!

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.420
Wait, you!

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.010
Where'd he go?!

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.600
The way out...

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.070
Where's the way out?

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.530
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.410
Nii-chan, you want some?

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.520
I see.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.870
I'll eat it all by myself then.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.710
I guess I'll start with the mandarin.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.420
Nope, changed my mind.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.120
I'll eat the cherry first.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.800
Look, Jiroumaru!

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.710
It's father!

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:40.510
Dad!

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.490
Ichirouhiko, Jiroumaru, has your training been going well?

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.750
Yes!

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.500
Father, I'd love for you to train me as well.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.750
Of course, right away.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.150
Master.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.300
I'll make some time, so can you wait a little longer?

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.940
Huh, again?

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:57.490
Yes!

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.010
I'm sorry.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.120
Kumatetsu!

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.000
Oh, Iouzen.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.730
I heard you got yourself a disciple for the first time in a while.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.570
Yeah, but he ran off somewhere.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.730
Did you see him?

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.460
He's a brat about this small.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.460
A child?

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.640
Even though you're quite the child yourself?

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.070
Tch, shut up.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.930
I'm saying this as the father of two children,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.710
being a parent will be difficult for you because of your lack of experience.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.900
Is that so?!

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.830
I'm the type that doesn't change his mind once he's decided on something.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.680
Anyway, Kyuuta's really fast...

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.950
These human kids...

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.840
Human?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.030
Your disciple is a human child?!

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:43.910
Master!

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.110
It hurts!

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.830
Let go!

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.060
A human?

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.540
Why is it in our world?

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.730
That's a human?

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.790
Why's a human here?

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.580
Oh, Kyuuta!

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.750
Hold on, Kumatetsu!

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.060
I won't make fun of you, just put him back where you found him.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.550
What's the problem with a human or two?

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.690
None of you probably know the real reason...

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.440
why we beasts and humans live in separate worlds.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.980
While humans are weak,

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.050
they can harbour darkness deep in their hearts.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.270
What if the darkness gets to him and we can't control him?

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.980
Darkness?

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.730
I didn't see such a thing in him.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.990
Listen, this problem doesn't concern only you!

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.620
What happens to my disciple is my decision!

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.040
I'm warning you, for the sake of everyone in Juutengai, stop it!

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.000
For everyone's sake?

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.560
You think you've already become the new grandmaster, Iouzen?

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.700
What?

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.380
Let's see if you can stop me by force.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.470
We can even decide the next successor right here.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.380
Iouzen and Kumatetsu are having a showdown!

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.320
Finally!

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.570
Clear the area!

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:50.860
The new grandmaster is going to be decided?

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.550
Gather around!

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.520
This is great!

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.460
Calm down, Kumatetsu!

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.900
Nice, go get him!

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.150
I'm betting on Iouzen!

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.190
I'm betting on Iouzen, too!

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.380
Me, too!

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.150
We can't bet if everyone chooses the same guy!

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.420
Well, well..

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.400
Father.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.720
Stand back.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.760
What's with Kumatetsu's attitude?!

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.100
Don't you have any manners?!

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.400
Are you making a fool of us?!

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.460
Learn from Iouzen!

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.090
Hey!

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.170
Show some etiquette!

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.360
He doesn't have any etiquette in the first place.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.850
That idiot has turned everyone against him.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.700
Are they going to have a sword fight?

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.220
The grandmaster has prohibited the unsheathing of swords,

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.300
Our swords have their hand-guards tied to the sheaths, so they can't be drawn.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.740
Is that... so?!

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.240
Hey, wait!

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.690
Where'd  he go?!

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.930
What's that idiot doing...?

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.260
That's his way of provoking the enemy.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.070
Whoa, as expected of Iouzen!

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.360
He's gonna do the same thing?

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.750
He got him!

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.380
Idiot!

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.840
Damn!

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.440
Whoops...

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:06.820
We're not done yet!

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.500
Father!

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.270
Don't worry.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.720
Ready....

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.850
Go!

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:01.730
Out of the way!

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.640
Iouzen is being driven into a corner!

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.050
Has the match been decided?!

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.390
Iouzen, don't give up!

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:19.700
Iouzen!

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.170
No one...

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.230
No one is cheering for him.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.690
He's... all alone.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:33.240
Iouzen!

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.050
Damn!

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:53.760
Had enough yet?

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.600
I won't stop until I've beat you!

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.970
Give it a rest already.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.380
What?

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.730
We're not done yet!

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:21.540
Iouzen!

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.630
You can do it, Iouzen!

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.720
Get him, Dad!

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600
Kumatetsu!

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.940
Don't you lose!

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:53.920
Who was that?

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.860
There's someone who'd cheer for Kumatetsu?

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.210
Who is it?

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:00.830
Don't you lose!

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.790
Kyuu-

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:09.290
It's over!

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.010
That's enough.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.140
Grandmaster.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.300
What are you doing?

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.530
It's still too early for the match.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.770
I haven't yet decided what kind of god I want to become.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:33.440
Grandmaster, please punish Kumatetsu for bringing in a human.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.260
You say "punish",

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.500
but you seem to have punished him plenty yourself.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:45.440
I don't care what anyone says, Kyuuta is my disciple!

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.120
I see you're determined.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.610
Are you going to make an exception for him?

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.420
It's unfortunate, but Kumatetsu can't take responsibility!

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.350
I'll take responsibility.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.130
I'm the one who insisted on Kumatetsu taking a disciple, after all.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.090
But if he allows darkness into him...

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.180
It's not like all humans are consumed by darkness.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.650
But...!

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.370
Why are you always so easy on Kumatetsu?

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.200
This conversation is over.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.150
Disperse!

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.300
Kumatetsu, be grateful the grandmaster has such a kind heart.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.120
Damn!

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.420
You're strong, aren't you?

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.060
Weren't you watching?

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.380
If I can really become strong by staying with you,

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.880
then I don't mind becoming your disciple.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.660
You'll probably run away again.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.410
These haven't expired yet, right?

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.930
D-Delicious...

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.060
All right, Kyuuta!

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.280
I'll train you thoroughly, prepare yourself!

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.730
It suits you, Kyuuta.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:53.460
Quiet!

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:56.630
Watch carefully.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.600
Splendid, splendid!

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.390
Got it?

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.840
If you got it, do it!

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.850
Do it...?

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.610
Kyuuta, do your best.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.920
Ow!

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.310
Stop.

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.050
Stop it!

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.970
Where should I make improvements?

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.550
"Improvements", he says!

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:50.470
You're making me laugh!

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.440
It can't be helped, it's my first time!

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.060
"First time!"

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.960
"My first time!"

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.590
Enough, shut up!

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.540
Simply saying "do it" isn't enough.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.560
Explain properly from the beginning.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.450
Explain?

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.730
Isn't that the master's duty?

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.520
All right then.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.790
First, hold your sword like <i>oomph</i>.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.210
Then do <i>whoosh</i> and <i>bam</i>!

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.500
Okay?

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:23.170
That's it?

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.740
Like I said,

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:29.050
hold it like <i>oomph</i>, then do <i>whoosh</i> and <i>woom</i>!

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:30.470
Okay?

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.470
<i>Oomph</i>?

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.550
Like I said, <i>oomph</i>!

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:36.310
<i>Oomph...</i>

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.440
No, no, no!

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.440
It's <i>uumph</i>.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.410
<i>Uumph</i>!

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.780
No, no, no, no!

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.970
It's <i>wuumph</i>!

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.080
<i>Wuumph</i>!

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.680
No, no, no, no, no!

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.140
<i>Gyuumph</i>!

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.450
<i>Gyoomph</i>!

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.110
<i>G-Gyoomph</i>!

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.490
No, no, no, no!

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.920
It's all wrong!

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.250
Man, you really catch on slowly!

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:00.840
No wonder I can't do it!

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.650
What?!

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.980
How do you expect me to do it with that kind of teaching?!

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.720
Stop complaining and just do it!

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.380
No.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.250
Do it!

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.890
No.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.140
Damn...!

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.120
Kyuuta is a beginner, explain it simpler.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.850
Yeah, I got it!

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.390
I'll explain it even more detailed then!

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.690
Grasp the sword in your heart!

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.730
You have one in your heart, don't you?!

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.610
Huh? How could I have such a thing?

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.800
The sword in your heart is important!

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.370
It's right here!

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.090
Right here!

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:30.510
Do it if you understand!

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.410
Do it!

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:42.090
Where are you going?

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.230
What's up with him?

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.870
All he does is yell...

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.820
Kumatetsu!

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.410
Wait, Kumatetsu!

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.690
How can there be a sword in my heart, idiot.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.400
You should go back home.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.020
Huh?

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.970
A disciple usually needs five to ten years of training.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.110
You won't make it if you take it so lightly.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.990
If you're just looking for free food,

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.500
go bother someone else in the human world.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.830
This isn't the place for you.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.240
If you understand, make yourself scarce!

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.840
Where's he?

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.130
Not sure.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.960
He said he'd be gone for 2-3 days.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.760
Can you tell me what a disciple is supposed to do?

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:30.900
First would be cleaning, laundry, and cooking.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.180
What's with the sudden change?

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.260
Is it about yesterday?

00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.930
Not really.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.660
Forget about it.

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.020
He may get mad quickly,

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.310
but it's all forgotten by the next day.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:46.900
It's not something you should be worried about.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.860
Like I said, that's not it.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.740
They'll get wrinkled like that, stretch them out a bit.

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.720
Okay.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.310
I've never had a human customer before.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.170
Is that so?

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.230
How long are you gonna be around?

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.430
I don't know.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:14.500
How unsocial.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.510
Geez, these humans...

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.340
Damn human!

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.700
Damn monster!

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.910
I heard my father talk about it.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.530
Sooner or later, humans become uncontrollable.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:41.620
I'll exterminate you while I still can!

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.110
Stop it, Jiroumaru!

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:44.920
Nii-chan.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:48.290
How could someone so weak become a monster?

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.430
Next time my brother bullies you, call me.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:52.500
I'll scold him.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.780
You're dead if you rat me out!

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.240
Enough, Jiroumaru!

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.850
Seeing weak people makes me angry.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.990
Hey, my brother is really strong!

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:05.280
Like a hermit, he can move things without touching them!

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.410
Come on, show him, too!

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:08.250
No!

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:13.110
Doesn't father always say that strength isn't for showing off, but for kindness?!

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:16.960
I may still be a child, but I'll train hard...

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.410
and one day become a great swordsman
with a long nose and big tusks like father.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.980
Me, too!

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.670
I'll become a cool swordsman like dad, too!

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:26.420
Let's go.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.380
Yeah!

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.960
"Someone so weak", huh...

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:35.970
Damn!

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.150
The hell?!

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.060
Who did this?!

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.200
It was your disciple.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.520
Don't do unnecessary things!

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.020
Huh?

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.480
What's with those bruises?

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.740
Pitiful.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:58.180
Geez, aren't you ashamed of being beat up?

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.910
Indeed, I'm pitiful and weak.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:01.950
It's as you say.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.580
As long as you understand.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.420
Then let me be blunt.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.500
What about you?

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.450
Huh?

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:10.590
He wakes up early, you sleep till noon.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.880
He's busy, you have time to spare.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.250
Even though you have time, you're not doing anything.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.180
Are you talking about Iouzen?

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.910
Even though he's busy, he's polite.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.580
Even though you have time, you're short-tempered.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.430
What are you trying to say?

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.990
I totally get why you couldn't defeat him!

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:30.910
What was that?!

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.610
Say it again, I dare you!

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:34.900
I'll say it as many times as I have to!

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.560
You're the worst!

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.860
Calm down, you two!

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.260
How dare you talk like that to your master?!

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.260
If you're a master, then act like one!

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.780
What?!

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.550
The smallest things make you mad!

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:46.220
Hey!

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.340
You give up quickly!

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:52.710
It's fine that you have the guts to express your opinion,
but a disciple should just shut up and listen!

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:53.810
In your dreams!

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:56.090
If I listen to you, I'll become stupid!

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.560
Stay still, you!

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.770
Shut up, idiot!

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.210
Forgive him, Kyuuta.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.860
This is just how he is, please understand.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.760
Ah, Kumatetsu, let's go outside!
This is just how he is, please understand.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:03.940
This is just how he is, please understand.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.040
Stop!

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:04.470
Outside!

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.220
Let go! Let go!

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.980
Damn, damn, damn!

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:12.220
I'm the trying the best I can!

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.300
Yet what's up with that kid?!

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.470
You've had enough, right?

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.320
Just kick him out already.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.030
Besides, I don't have spare time!

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.340
I chop wood, catch fish and pick tea to earn a living!

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.190
His share, too!

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.480
Just stop, you've done enough.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.850
So how could he say those things?!

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.670
Right?!

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.420
I couldn't agree more.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.420
You were living alone before, so you should know.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.660
Living alone is awesome!

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.640
No responsibilities, no annoyances!

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.290
You don't even have to have a full stomach!

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.100
Uh...!

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.090
Oops, shouldn't have said that one.

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:52.300
Practising till late at night is commendable, Kumatetsu.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.150
Grandmaster!

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:58.580
Letting your disciple see how hard you work should serve as a good lesson.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.300
Uh, yeah, that's what I was thinking...

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.470
Very well.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.260
These shall be your reward.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.460
What are those?

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.790
Letters of introduction.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:07.740
Letters of introduction?

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.770
Take your disciple and travel around the country.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:14.790
You can meet the other grandmasters in no time with these.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:15.850
B-But...

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:21.380
These famous sages can give you clues about what real strength is.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.240
But...

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.520
Well then, have a nice trip!

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.350
It was a good chance to ditch the brat.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:35.190
But since this comes from the grandmaster, you can't refuse.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.400
Too slow!

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.500
Too slow!

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.340
Too slow!

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.720
Damn!

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.100
At least eat your food slowly...

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.690
Excuse us for asking.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.440
What is strength?

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.810
My arms aren't very strong,

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:25.070
but look, I can create illusions.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.270
Don't make light of it!

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.910
Illusions can sometimes be more real than reality itself.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.290
That is...

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:32.450
That is...?

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.830
...strength.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.170
What is strength?

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.170
Why do you seek something like that?

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.560
I possess some telekinetic powers,

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.840
but no matter how strong I am, there are things I can't win against.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.820
That is...

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.500
That is...?

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.560
Can I ask you for something?

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.420
Could you please massage my back?

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.370
Telekinesis doesn't work on back pain.

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.270
Ow, ow, ow...

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.690
Strength?

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.530
You're asking the wrong person.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.540
Whether it's rainy or windy,

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.160
I simply sit here like a stone.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.410
Why?

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:19.920
To forget time, the world and myself in order to transcend reality.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.920
That is...

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.370
That is...?

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.170
She turned into stone.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.640
Strength?

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.470
I'm not one to philosophise.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:35.520
I catch my prey faster than anyone else.　

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.460
The one who gets to taste everything in this world wins.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.680
If you like something, don't hold back.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.860
That is...

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.190
That is...?

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:48.070
An opening!

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.080
Don't worry, I don't eat guests.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.650
See?

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.870
If you listen to that nonsense, you'll lose your way.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:07.650
I was almost eaten alive!

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.940
Strength seems to have many meanings.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.100
They all said interesting things.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.570
If you liked it so much, why don't you just study quietly sitting at a desk?

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.950
At least learning like that would be worthwhile!

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:22.190
Unlike a certain someone's <i>oomph</i> and <i>gyoomph</i>!

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.180
You have to figure it out yourself!

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.560
Just because you can't explain!

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.150
It's because you're a slow learner!

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.970
It's because you're bad at teaching!

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:29.450
What a slow-learning disciple!

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.270
When it comes to arguing, your stamina is endless...
What a slow-learning disciple!

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:32.420
What was that?!
When it comes to arguing, your stamina is endless...

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.610
When it comes to arguing, your stamina is endless...

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:36.450
Give it a rest, I'm tired!

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.460
Can't sleep?

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.340
Do I lack talent?

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.680
Are you worried about it?

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.220
He calls me a slow learner.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.850
I don't agree with that.

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:02.690
Be it laundry or cleaning, at first you knew nothing about it,

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:05.360
but with little teaching you got the hang of it quickly.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.400
Those who work sincerely learn fast.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.640
But...

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.320
The problem lies with Kumatetsu.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.220
Look at his techniques, they're a mess.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.100
In other words, he created them.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.670
But why?

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.250
He has no parents and no master.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.660
He became strong all by himself.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.850
He became stronger.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.690
That is his talent and also his misfortune.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:35.760
If you never listen to anyone, you can't give proper advice.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.640
I see.

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:42.270
But sometimes, he says "Oh, I see."

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.310
Do you get it?

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.740
"You have to figure it out yourself."

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.290
Exactly, I believe that's his principle.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.710
I don't know a better way to teach.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.660
To think the peerless Kumatetsu-sama...

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.300
would fuss over that cheeky brat so much.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.750
I-It's not like that!

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:07.920
Well, you weren't any better when you were little.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.500
Even though you were weak, you sure were noisy.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.630
Only because I didn't have a master!

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:16.430
The grandmaster was the only one who'd put up with you.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:20.760
Because you were troublesome and would never listen,
you'd get beat up over the smallest things.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.190
Damn, just remembering them pisses me off!

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:25.880
Indeed.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.940
He's just like you right now.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.280
Well, I'd prefer it if he were gone as soon as possible.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.700
But if you're going to continue being his master,

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:41.550
remember what you <i>really</i> wanted when you were a brat.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:44.130
Well then, good night.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.030
"You have to figure it out yourself", huh?

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.010
I don't get it...

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.030
That was you just now.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.270
Huh? No good?

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.560
Become him.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.200
Huh?

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.170
Was that you just now?

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:35.090
Become him...

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:37.660
Become him.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.200
What am I doing...?

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.300
I should at least learn the footwork.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.440
Ow, ow, ow...

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.370
What was that?

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:41.700
What are you doing?

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.370
Become him.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.610
What are you two doing?

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.300
Are you making a fool of me?!

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.490
I'm not!

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:19.290
Then what are you doing?!

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:20.490
None of your business!

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:32.470
You're annoying!

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:37.260
Huh?

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.170
Where did he run off to?

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:42.260
What's up with that?!

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.460
He's like a duck following its parent.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.940
I'm not a duck!

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.800
Isn't it normal for a child to imitate his parent?

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.540
I'm not his parent.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.480
Kyuuta intends to learn from you from scratch.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.480
Like a baby following his parent.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:57.280
A baby?

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:16.860
Kumatetsu doesn't seem dissatisfied.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.340
No parent would be unhappy about his child trying to become like him.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.790
Hey brat, how long are you going to continue this farce?

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:27.420
If imitating someone could make you stronger, there'd be no hardships!

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.110
Hey, don't distract us!

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:30.280
Huh?

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.520
Weren't you really annoyed by it?

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.310
It's fine, just go away!

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:35.760
Hey, hey...

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.060
What's up with him?

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.050
I don't know.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:42.130
Maybe he's warmed up to his sincere disciple.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.610
No way...

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:47.320
Seriously?!

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.860
Here!

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.220
All right, I get it!

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.470
Then how about this?!

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:12.970
Perfect!

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:14.240
No, time out!

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.210
No time outs!

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:17.440
Wait, give that back!

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.400
Nope!

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:32.760
Huh?

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:41.290
Even though I'm not looking,

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.710
I know.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.050
I know!

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.220
Damn!

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:56.680
Should I try it out?

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.240
Ow!

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:07.880
Ow, ow, ow...

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.900
What's wrong, Kyuuta?
Ow, ow, ow...

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.250
What's wrong, Kyuuta?

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:10.370
What are you doing?!

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:12.440
Stop, stop!

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.200
Huh?

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.990
What's happening?

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:20.830
Kyuuta, you...

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.180
I kept observing his footwork,

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:25.590
suddenly I could tell what he'd do next.

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:26.370
What?!

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.010
Stop joking!

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.720
That's amazing, Kyuuta!

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:35.060
You just made me admire you for the first time!

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.390
Kumatetsu, you better learn from Kyuuta.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.030
Learn from him?!

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.250
Why would I?!

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:43.560
I don't mind teaching you.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.060
Huh?!

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.600
In return...

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.050
Huh?!

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:51.580
I have no idea how to hold a sword or throw a punch,

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.030
so please teach me!

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:02.920
Ow!

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.840
Damn, explain it in more detail!

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:08.920
Ow!

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.460
Observe your opponent and become one with him.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.010
Ow!

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:12.970
Become one!

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:18.020
That's what Kumatetsu gets for never paying attention to anyone but himself.

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.150
Understanding his enemy is the thing he's worst at.

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:23.980
That's the drawback of becoming strong all by yourself.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.200
Ow!

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.820
Become one with your opponent!

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.820
That's what I'm doing!

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.160
You can't do it at all!

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.570
Acting all high and mighty, you...!

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:36.660
Explain it in more detail.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.340
Damn!

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.300
Don't get full of yourself!

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.260
I'm betting on Jiroumaru.

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.000
Me as well.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:57.890
Me, too.

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.930
Take this!

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:18.620
You're amazing!

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:21.580
I like strong people!

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.460
Come over to my place next time!

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:25.290
We have lots of tasty sweets!

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.750
So come over, 'kay?

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:30.890
I did it!

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.590
Damn!

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:38.720
Just take your time when you're eating...

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.870
I win!

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.090
You do the dishes!

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:41.560
Damn!

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:50.980
You've grown quite a bit.

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.800
You think so, Hyaku-san?

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.530
Eh?

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:54.720
Tata-san?

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.020
When did this happen...

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:56.950
Seriously?

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:10.000
His form is decent.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.460
It seems so.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:14.140
For a human, his progress is astonishing.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.750
Haven't you noticed?

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:17.580
Huh?

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:20.750
The one who progressed the most is Kumatetsu.

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.650
His movements are refined and sharp.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:24.630
Indeed.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:26.810
You can't tell which one's the master.

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:33.480
Kyuuta, how old are you now?

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.490
"17th boy"
I see, then you're Jyuunanata from now on.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:39.990
Kyuuta is fine.

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:47.210
Master Kumatetsu!

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:49.490
Please take me as your disciple!

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:51.880
I'd like to become strong like Kyuuta-san!

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.560
All right, nice determination.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.490
Thank you very much!

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:57.100
Well then, go line up.

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:57.590
Eh?!

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:01.530
Wait at the end of the line until you're called!

00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:07.820
They're all still green behind the ears
and don't seem to have what it takes.

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:08.390
Hm?

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:10.260
I decide what I practice!

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.790
No, I do!

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:14.630
Kyuuta's already an adult, treat him like one.

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:15.860
He is?

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:18.260
He doesn't even have any fur!

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.580
I do have fur!

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:20.740
Where?!

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.450
Now, now...

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:23.350
I win!

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:24.130
See ya!

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:24.870
Wait!

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:27.000
I'm not done talking!

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.500
You do the dishes!

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.300
Wait, damnit!

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:34.390
Hey Kyuuta, let's go to our place!

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:35.820
Later!

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.340
I told you to wait!

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.750
Kyuuta really is something.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:42.180
Thanks to him, Kumatetsu has improved a lot.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:45.600
Dad said that our unit can't let its guard down.

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:47.350
Kumatetsu?

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:51.560
Don't compare such a blockhead with father.

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:54.960
Huh?

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.270
What's wrong, Nii-chan?

00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.940
It's nothing.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.670
Whoops!

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:02.660
Where'd he go?!

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.370
Geez, he's really stubborn.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.340
Huh? This is...

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:57.140
The important thing is...

00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:59.790
only so... because...

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:03.060
you keep it close...

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.510
That is so...

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:09.520
because... you had it... for a long time...

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.360
Say...

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:23.900
how do you read this?

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:27.370
"Whale".

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.370
Oh, so it's "whale".

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:38.630
I told you so!

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:39.540
Dunno what you mean!

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:40.520
Shut up already!

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.750
Hello?

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:42.750
They hung up!

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.470
Who was it?

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:46.260
No idea.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.380
What is it?

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.100
If you're gonna be noisy, do it outside.

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.930
Can I do whatever I want outside?

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:58.120
That's up to you.

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.920
Let's go.

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.460
She wouldn't shut up since first class, so everyone ignores her.

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.520
Huh... So we can do whatever we want?

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.020
Hey, don't run away!

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.510
Stop it!

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:38.340
I can do whatever I want outside, right?!

00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:41.030
We're not bothering anyone after all!

00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:45.580
Don't move...

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:50.100
Oh, you saw that?

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.490
Ah, you see, there was some trouble.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:56.420
You didn't see anything, did you?! Huh?!

00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:57.320
You piece of shit!

00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.660
What's with that look?

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.290
What's up with his clothes?

00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:02.100
They're lame!

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.150
So lame!

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:08.150
Let's go.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:09.170
Yeah.

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:24.900
It's a lie that everyone gets along in a new school.

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:28.800
Violence is bad.

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.040
However, thank you for saving me.

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.280
I didn't really save you.

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.900
You <i>did</i> save me.

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.790
Say, how do you read this?

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.320
I don't know anything.

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.430
I haven't been to school since primary school.

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:47.460
Really?

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:54.930
In that case, I'll teach you all the characters in that book.

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.470
Really?

00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:59.390
Yes.

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:01.870
I'm Kaede.

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:05.110
It's written with the characters "tree" and "wind", "Kaede".

00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:07.850
I'm... Ren.

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:10.110
The characters for Ren are...

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:14.450
"Tsuranaru" with a "grass" radical.

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:15.580
Right...

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:19.270
Ren-kun.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.480
"Break on through the-

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.610
Kyuuta! Kyuuta!

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:51.990
Shut up!

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.710
Too slow!

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:53.570
Don't yell!

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.350
Kyuuta!

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:20.060
He's long gone.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.310
He seems busy lately.

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:23.770
Busy with what?!

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:29.730
The protagonist wants revenge on the whale who took his leg.

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:35.090
But the protagonist is actually fighting against himself.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.040
Against himself?

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.910
It means the whale is a reflection of himself.

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:41.740
Reflection...

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:44.710
Your concentration is incredible.

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:48.250
At this rate, you should be able to solve the problems in the reference book in no time.

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.390
It's because you're a good teacher.

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:51.630
Really?

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:54.720
I have a bossy master, so I can tell.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.830
By master, do you mean the kendo master who raised you?

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.090
He's useless.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.290
You must be close.

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:05.030
No way, we always fight.

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:06.980
Sounds nice, I'm jealous.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.250
Why?

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:11.560
I don't ever fight with my parents.

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:14.030
Huh?

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:17.530
I'm here for the happiness of my parents.

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:23.040
Since kindergarten, I desperately tried to get the grades my parents wanted.

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:26.660
Yet they don't know how I feel.

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.280
They don't even notice.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.850
But I know.

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:33.530
Unless I find out who I am by myself,

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.530
it won't be really me.

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:38.260
So even though it's difficult right now, I study hard.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:43.190
Once I graduate and make it into a university, I'll move out.

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:45.940
After that, I'll study only for myself.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.340
Graduate out of my own strength.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.900
And then, live my own life.

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:02.160
I've never told this to anyone before.

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:05.660
I feel relieved.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:07.160
Kaede...

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.870
Hey, about that book...

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.500
There are limits to what I can teach.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:18.360
I'm sure there are even better teachers.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.300
Where?

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.720
Ren-kun, would you like to go to university?

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:23.430
That's...

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:25.410
I'll help you with the entrance exams!

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:26.810
But me going to university...

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.150
Don't you want to know more about the things you don't know?

01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:35.110
I do.

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:40.240
"Kounin" is the certificate people
who're at high school graduate level can get.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.540
It used to be called "daiken", it's a university entrance test for people who didn't graduate from high school.

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:47.170
It's impossible.

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.130
Huh?

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:50.300
I don't know your proficiency,

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.380
but if you've been a shut-in till you're this old,

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.060
how about starting with evening middle school?

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.080
Ah, but...

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.460
Life isn't that easy.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.630
Even if you were accepted, without a guardian,

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:02.160
what about the tuition payments?

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.210
Even scholarships are hard to get nowadays.

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:07.720
But...

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:10.070
I totally get it!

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:12.480
I knew university would be impossible for me...

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.030
I apologise for that!

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:16.950
Feel free to consult me.

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:19.410
There are quite a few universities with scholarship systems.

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.180
You can also arrange a corporate scholarship which you don't need to pay back.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.410
Dependant on your grades, of course.

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:26.800
Thank you very much!

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.540
Thank you very much.

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:31.680
Math and science are compulsory.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.370
I haven't studied them at all.

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:36.630
Leave it to me, I'll teach you everything!

01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:41.250
We need a certificate of residence for the Kounin test.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:44.610
It seems your former certificate has been erased.

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:45.730
I knew it...

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:49.190
But since there are still records of your family register,

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:51.270
we can register a new certificate of residence.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.920
Is your father's current address correct?

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.370
Please verify it.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.990
The father you were separated from?

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:05.820
I had no idea where he was.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:08.950
But to find him this easily...

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:11.140
Are you going to meet him?

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.410
I might be a bother if I suddenly went there.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.500
He might have forgotten about me.

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:18.250
But...

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.940
But...

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.500
What should I write...

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.860
Dad, throw the ball!

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.610
Here!

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:05.340
Sir, you forgot something.

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.630
Really, how careless of me.

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:10.180
Thank you very much.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.260
You're welcome.

01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:15.570
Um...

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.730
Yes?

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:23.190
Do you... remember... me?

01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:36.120
I knew it...

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:38.930
I'm sorry.

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:47.960
Ren?

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.560
Are you Ren?

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.320
You've grown so much,

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.320
how could I tell?!

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.120
Where were you till now?!

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:13.530
Oh, um, I was with people who were taking care of me, and...

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:16.120
I'm glad you're all right...

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.310
I'm sorry...

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.680
I couldn't do anything for you all this time...

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.880
Dad...

01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:31.310
I see.

01:06:31.310 --> 01:06:32.630
I'm happy for you.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:37.500
It turns out dad didn't find out about mum until a lot later.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.690
He kept looking for me.

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:43.680
Even after the police gave up, he still continued.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.770
I see.

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.820
Kaede!

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.050
Say, is that your boyfriend?

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:50.200
He's not!

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.210
Then who's he?

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:52.260
Which school is he from?

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.790
Go away!

01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:56.710
Sorry.

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:00.500
I wonder if I can also live an ordinary life now.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.250
Ordinary?

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.730
Live with my parents like an ordinary person.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:08.190
Study and work like an ordinary person.

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.600
Come home and sleep like an ordinary person.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.220
Maybe I can live like that, too.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.430
Are you hesitating?

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:20.400
Is it because of your master?

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:30.280
Where have you been?

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:33.520
I want to talk about something, listen seriously.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.270
How is your training?

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:36.820
Listen, the thing is...

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.180
You think you can neglect it?

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.420
Listen to him, Kumatetsu.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.580
And what's this?

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:44.480
I found it in your bed.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.750
Explain.

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:48.880
I want to go to a human school.

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.880
Huh?!

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.670
I want to know more about the other world, so...

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:55.140
Aren't there more important things you should do?

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.570
Didn't you want to become strong?

01:07:57.570 --> 01:07:58.420
I've become strong.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:59.920
Huh?! Don't make me laugh!

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.900
Kumatetsu.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.830
I've become plenty strong.

01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:05.980
What part of you is strong, huh?!

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.670
Talking with you always ends up like this...

01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:11.650
You ignore what I say and act selfish.

01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.780
Tell me, when did you become strong?!

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.780
That's enough.

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.140
Wait!

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.570
Where are you off to?

01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:19.160
There's one more thing.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.860
I found my father, I'm going there.

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.250
That's what I just decided.

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.040
Wait, wait!

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.740
Don't go!

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:29.440
Step aside.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.580
I won't let you go!

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.850
Don't go!

01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:41.010
Kyuuta!

01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:43.810
Kyuuta!

01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:48.770
Were you able to resolve things?

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:51.510
I guess not...

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:53.540
Doesn't matter anymore.

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:57.400
I'm going to meet my dad now, and everything will be fine.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.620
Aren't you overdoing it?

01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.930
Why would I?

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:03.100
I'll be at the library today.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.750
Come to me if anything happens.

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:08.170
Wrong!

01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:09.460
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.250
I'm sorry!

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.840
Shouldn't you get it if you're a quick learner?

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.710
I'm sorry!

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:15.630
Don't apologise for everything!

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:16.860
I'm sorry!

01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.720
Enough!

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:20.500
Each and every one of them...

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.610
To find his father after all this time...

01:09:23.610 --> 01:09:25.560
Does he really not intend to come back?

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.850
Why would he come back?

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:28.810
Yeah...

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:33.120
Without Kyuuta, Kumatetsu will regress to his former useless self.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.450
No, he's already-

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:35.580
Shut up!

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.280
What are you doing?! That's dangerous!

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.920
He saw himself as Kyuuta's foster parent.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.630
He did?

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:46.250
Damn!

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:55.170
Ren!

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.050
Tonight's dinner is ham omelette!

01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:01.440
Let's prepare it and eat together.

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:12.720
By the way, could you tell me more about the person who's taken care of you till now?

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.860
Huh?

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:17.240
I have to visit him and thank him properly.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.360
After that, we can live together.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.240
Wait a moment.

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.720
Isn't that obvious?

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.580
It just seems a bit sudden...

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:32.380
I see... I...

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.680
Right...

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.800
Time flows different for adults and children.

01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:44.140
The time I spent with you and your mother feels like yesterday to me.

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:45.990
Yesterday?

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:47.390
Sorry for rushing things.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.490
Let's slowly start over.

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.820
We'll forget all the painful things...

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:55.460
and live facing forward from now on.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.230
Start over what?

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.120
Why do you decide that it's just painful?

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.200
What do you even know about me?!

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:04.080
Ren...

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.410
You don't know anything, so don't act like you do!

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:07.950
Ren, I...

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:18.980
Of course you don't know...

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.840
I haven't told you anything...

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.050
Sorry, I won't come over today.

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:23.840
And your meal?

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.180
No, thanks.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.470
Ren, I don't mind if you decide what we do from now on!

01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:30.940
But don't forget!

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:34.460
I'll do whatever I can! So...

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.900
Ren!

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.820
What's going on with me?

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.660
Why did I say those things to dad?

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.620
Don't go!

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.700
Damn, why am I remembering him?

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:48.660
Let's start over.

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:49.910
Damn.

01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:50.870
Don't go!

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:51.830
Damn!

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:53.580
I don't get it!

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:15.860
That's...

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:18.310
I hate you.

01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:23.200
I hate... you...

01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:25.360
The old me?

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:30.890
A hole?

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:34.920
It disappeared!

01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:05.430
Ren-kun?

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:18.410
You have a really scary look, like you aren't yourself.

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:21.660
Please tell me, what am I?

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.500
Am I a human, or am I a beast?

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.740
A beast?

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:29.000
Or... am I an ugly monster?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:29.970
What are saying?

01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:34.680
Come on, tell me, what am I?

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:36.910
Ren-kun, you're not yourself.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.690
Just what... am I?!

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:58.760
I too am sometimes in so much pain that I don't know what to do.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.170
No matter what I do,

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:03.250
it feels like something's going to burst in my chest.

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:06.350
It's not just you.

01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:07.700
It's not just me.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.440
I'm sure it happens to everyone.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.900
That's why you'll be fine.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.150
That's why...

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.400
you'll be fine!

01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:24.080
Thank you.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.530
I've calmed down.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.390
I'm myself again.

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:30.140
Wait.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.180
I've liked this bookmark since I was little.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.950
It has helped me many times.

01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:43.750
If you're ever uncertain of yourself or have feelings like before,

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:48.280
remember... this charm.

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:55.570
Huh? What's going on?

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:56.810
Kyuuta!

01:14:57.650 --> 01:14:59.230
Let's go to my place.

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:03.070
The grandmaster has suddenly decided on a day,

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:04.800
so the city is in an uproar.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.650
Decided on a day?

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.860
Take your time.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.950
Thank you, Mum.

01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:14.180
The match between my dad and your master is tomorrow.

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.490
The match to decide the new grandmaster.

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:18.530
You didn't know?

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:20.370
We kinda had a fight.

01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:23.050
It got awkward so I kept my distance.

01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:24.000
I see.

01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:28.730
We haven't seen dad around lately, either.

01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:31.410
He's been busy training.

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:33.930
I miss him, but it can't be helped.

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:37.180
You don't want your master to lose either, right?

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:41.210
So just forget about that awkward stuff and cheer him on.

01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:42.420
Yeah.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:45.690
Regardless of the outcome, we remain friends.

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:46.940
Of course.

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.940
I hope it's a good match.

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:49.650
Yeah.

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:52.650
Jiroumaru!

01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:53.450
Nii-chan!

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.690
Kyuuta might be troubled if you keep him occupied for too long.

01:15:57.690 --> 01:15:58.710
You hear that?

01:15:58.710 --> 01:16:00.470
Even the cicadas started chirping.

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:02.560
I'll walk him to the entrance.

01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:08.130
Thanks. Well then...

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.100
What... good match?!

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:22.780
The outcome... is already... obvious!

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:24.320
A human like you...

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.730
A blockhead... like Kumatetsu...

01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:30.070
Know your places as the blockheads you are!

01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:33.570
Ichirouhiko...

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:43.210
Why does he have the same thing...?

01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:45.370
Why...?

01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:11.540
Which one are you rooting for?

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.860
I'm not sure.

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:14.490
I'm betting on Iouzen.

01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:15.770
I'm betting on Kumatetsu.

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:16.900
I...

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.320
How worrying!

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.230
I've been worrying.

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:24.020
For the past nine years, I've been worrying, worrying, worrying.

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:26.370
And I have finally reached a decision.

01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:29.330
So, what kind of god are you going to become?

01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:31.710
Definitely the god of decisiveness!

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:37.000
The reincarnation ritual will be held after the match.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.850
Enjoy it.

01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:44.310
The match to select the next grandmaster will now commence!

01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:46.660
The candidates shall step forward!

01:17:58.450 --> 01:17:59.730
Woah!

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:02.870
There's a huge difference in the expressions of your disciples!

01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:05.040
If only Kyuuta were here.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.330
Kumatetsu, don't look so gloomy, the match is about to begin!

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:14.760
Be quiet!

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.570
In accordance to the rules, the swords shall remain sheathed.

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:33.020
Unsheathing them won't be forgiven!

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:34.980
Running away results in a loss.

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:38.730
Remaining down by the count of ten results in a loss.

01:18:38.730 --> 01:18:41.870
We shall bear witness to the compliance of these rules.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.830
Candidates, prepare!

01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:51.580
Begin!

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:56.880
Out of nowhere?!

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.190
Kumatetsu is pushing him back.

01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:02.300
Even though he lacks stamina!

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.250
Dad!

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:07.470
Shut up and keep watching!

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.450
See?!

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.100
Damn!

01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:57.650
As expected of father!

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:04.260
This is bad...

01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.620
He keeps getting hit...

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.510
This is...

01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:10.620
Has it been decided?

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:14.290
Are you finished already, Kumatetsu?!

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.890
One!

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:27.850
Two!

01:20:28.330 --> 01:20:29.310
Three!

01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:31.770
Four!

01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:33.600
Five!

01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:35.150
Six!

01:20:35.150 --> 01:20:36.060
Damn!
Six!

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.520
Seven!

01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:40.940
Eight!

01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:41.530
Kyuuta!

01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.820
N-

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:44.740
It's Kyuuta!

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.510
He's Kumatetsu's best disciple.

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:47.660
He is?

01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:51.010
Kyuuta...

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:55.420
Please Kyuuta, cheer Kumatetsu on!

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.210
What are you doing, you dumbass?!

01:21:00.650 --> 01:21:02.710
Stand up already!

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:05.120
Didn't you leave?

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.430
How dare you show your face now?

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:09.600
And what's with your stupid shape?!

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.060
What did you say?!

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:11.530
Pathetic!

01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:12.920
This isn't the time to be swearing at each other!
Pathetic!

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:13.930
What?!
This isn't the time to be swearing at each other!

01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:14.080
You look miserable!
This isn't the time to be swearing at each other!

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.340
Gimme a break!
You look miserable!

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:15.540
Why does it always turn out like this?!
You look miserable!

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:17.100
Why does it always turn out like this?!

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.950
Stop being depressed!

01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:21.520
Get up by yourself already!

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.030
Even without you butting in, I won't lose!

01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:37.370
What?!

01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:44.290
He intends to continue?

01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:46.010
This just got interesting.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.890
One to the right!

01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:57.480
Dodge! Counter!

01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:00.310
You almost have him!

01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:06.900
Look, he's laughing.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:10.270
It's the face he makes when he trains with Kyuuta.

01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:12.870
Are you saying, even though he's in the middle of a match...

01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:17.580
His spirit has transcended beyond the enemy in front of him!

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:21.170
He is in a state of perfect concentration.

01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:23.550
Kumatetsu alone can't win.

01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:27.260
But I can't tell the outcome when they're together!

01:22:28.130 --> 01:22:29.970
Dad, hang in there!

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.020
Ahh, he'll lose!

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.260
Shut up!

01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:37.350
N-Nii-chan?

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.770
Kyuuta...!

01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:42.900
That bastard, even though he's just a human...!

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.180
Don't get pushed back!

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.280
Push back instead!

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.780
Use your ridiculous strength!

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:05.130
Now!

01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:07.260
What?!

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.380
Right there!

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:31.860
One!

01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:34.400
Two!

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.330
Three!

01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:37.840
Four!

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.620
Five!

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.250
Six!

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:43.140
Seven!

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.830
Eight!

01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:46.670
Nine!

01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:48.210
Ten!

01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:50.170
The winner has been decided!

01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:51.630
It's Kumatetsu!

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:14.110
Don't make me worry.

01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:16.450
I didn't ask you to.

01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:18.120
I'm glad you could win.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.700
Of course I'd win.

01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:21.910
Stop joking, you barely made it.

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:23.710
Shut up.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.350
It's the birth of a new grandmaster!

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.480
Banzai! Banzai!

01:24:42.850 --> 01:24:44.500
He's got a good son.

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:45.940
Huh?

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:47.560
Let's go.

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.120
The sword is... gone?

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:09.240
What is this red stuff?

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.710
Huh, Kyuuta?

01:25:12.090 --> 01:25:13.410
What's going on?

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:23.330
Father, the match was decided with my telekinesis and your sword!

01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:25.040
It's your win!

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.310
There's no way you'd lose to that blockhead, after all!

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.980
Isn't that right, Kyuuta?

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:33.900
Isn't that right?!

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.740
Stop, Ichirouhiko!

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:39.770
Father, I'm going to finish him off now.

01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:41.110
Please watch me.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:53.870
Did you see that, Kyuuta?!

01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:55.130
Serves you right!

01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.360
Do you get it?!

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.180
My father, Iouzen, is the winner!

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.600
You idiot, you think I'd accept something like this?!

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.290
Wh-What's that?!

01:26:11.290 --> 01:26:11.940
A hole?

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.230
You can't, Kyuuta!

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.030
How dare you...

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.450
How dare you...

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.080
Kyuuta, reject the darkness!

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:27.830
Nii-chan!

01:26:28.110 --> 01:26:29.470
Please stop, Kyuuta!

01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:30.790
What a disaster!

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.670
Kyuuta...

01:26:55.150 --> 01:26:57.110
you...

01:26:57.110 --> 01:27:00.700
Ichirouhiko is being consumed by the darkness!

01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:03.960
I won't forgive you...

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.980
Nii-chan, where are you?

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.000
Nii-chan!

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:22.430
Hey... why are you sleeping...?

01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:24.870
Wake... up...

01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.960
Kyuuta.

01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:34.120
Kyuuta!

01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:35.720
Too slow!

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.230
Too slow, too slow, too slow, too slow!

01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:38.350
What are you doing?!

01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:39.400
It's time for training!

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.320
Chiko...

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.720
What is it, Chiko?

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.070
I'm sorry...

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.900
Ichirouhiko, I'm sorry...

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.510
Ichirouhiko's telekinesis is by no means the ability of a beast.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:31.870
It is clearly a power that stems from the darkness within a human heart.

01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:35.790
Grandmaster, you already knew?

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:39.840
Iouzen, tell me your reason.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.200
His real parents must have had quite the circumstances.

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.810
I decided to hide it from everyone and raise him secretly.

01:29:10.810 --> 01:29:14.170
I knew that humans can harbour darkness in their hearts,

01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:17.030
but I thought it'd be fine if I raise him myself.

01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:20.990
Thinking back, I realise how conceited that was.

01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:23.170
It was my own arrogance.

01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:28.290
Why don't I have tusks like you?

01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:31.820
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll grow one day.

01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:35.970
Why isn't my nose long like yours?

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:38.600
Don't worry, with time...

01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:42.600
Father, just what am I...?

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:47.010
Ichirouhiko, you're none other than my son.

01:29:47.010 --> 01:29:49.980
You're the son of Iouzen.

01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:53.920
The more he believed he was the son of a beast,

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:57.580
the more insecure Ichirouhiko became.

01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.080
That's how the darkness in him was born.

01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:08.600
To think our world's ambiance caused the hole in a humans heart to grow to this extent...

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.050
What's this darkness?

01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:13.880
I'm stupid, so I don't get it.

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:16.730
It doesn't matter where my brother came from.

01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:18.770
To me, he's just my brother!

01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:20.780
Jiroumaru!

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:26.770
Grandmaster, will we be unable to live with Ichirouhiko anymore?

01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:29.740
Won't we be able to start things over?

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:33.260
Ichirouhiko is roaming around somewhere as we speak.

01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:40.040
As long as the darkness isn't expelled, there's nothing we can do.

01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:44.400
Kyuuta.

01:30:46.710 --> 01:30:49.010
You shouldn't get involved in this.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:52.830
You idiot!

01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:54.340
Do you want revenge?!

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.930
What good will that do?!

01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.420
H-Hey, Hyakushuubou?

01:30:58.420 --> 01:30:59.390
I can't hold it in anymore!

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:03.100
You're gravely mistaken if you think I'll be lenient like usual!

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:07.320
Don't you understand after seeing
Kumatetsu in that state, you fool?!

01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:19.370
You're still going?

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.150
I appreciate your scolding.

01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:26.880
Thanks to you, I can stand proud.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.980
However, it's not revenge I want.

01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:32.030
Ichirouhiko and I are the same.

01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:35.810
There's no doubt I could have ended up like him, too.

01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:40.850
It's thanks to the people who raised me that I didn't.

01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:45.650
It's thanks to Tata-san, Hyaku-san, and everyone else.

01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:48.150
Kyuuta, you...

01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:51.790
That doesn't mean I can act as if this doesn't concern me.

01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:54.990
Ichirouhiko's problem is also my problem.

01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:58.450
That's why... I'm going.

01:31:58.450 --> 01:32:01.160
Please take care of Kumatetsu.

01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:06.220
That was splendid!

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.300
I totally get your determination!

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.630
Leave Kumatetsu to us!

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.120
I won't take my eyes off him!

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.510
So you can go! Go!

01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:37.780
"It's thanks to the people who raised me", huh?

01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:42.360
For us to be included...

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:46.300
Well, we have been with him since he was little.

01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:47.420
Yeah.

01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:50.680
He was an impertinent, unpleasant brat at first.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.760
Whether it's been rainy or windy,

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.770
we've been visiting him every day.

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:56.380
Even though we were looking after him,

01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:58.810
he'd never say a word of thanks.

01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:02.220
And he's grown up before we even knew it.

01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:05.030
He's still cheeky, though.

01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:09.300
I'm so proud.

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.160
Me, too.

01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:17.620
Kumatetsu!

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.640
Ren-kun.

01:33:58.070 --> 01:34:00.280
I want to give this to you.

01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:02.260
Why?

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:03.040
What for?

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:06.660
There's an opponent I have to settle things with.

01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:08.640
I don't know if I can win.

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:11.450
If I lose, everything might be over.

01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:12.950
That's why...

01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:14.680
No way...

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.560
I'm glad I got to know you.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:20.340
Thanks to you, I got to learn a lot of new things.

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:23.720
You made me think, "the world is really big".

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:24.960
What are you saying?

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:25.930
We still...

01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:29.440
Studying together made me really happy.

01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:32.150
That's why I wanted to thank you.

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:34.150
Wait...

01:34:34.150 --> 01:34:35.830
I don't want that!

01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:37.320
That's not what I want...

01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:42.560
Kyuuta...!

01:34:46.130 --> 01:34:47.330
I won't forgive you.

01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:50.960
Even though you're just a human...

01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:53.390
Here of all places?!

01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:54.250
What's that?

01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:58.220
It's dangerous, run away.

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:03.050
What are you doing?!

01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:04.430
Go quickly!

01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:06.000
No!

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.020
I won't let go!

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:12.810
Damn!

01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:17.360
Run as fast as you can!

01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:24.450
Stay away!

01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:33.130
What's going on?

01:35:33.130 --> 01:35:35.460
Are they filming a movie?

01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:15.750
Ren-kun!

01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:27.390
Damn, we can't fight here.

01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:29.100
I need to find a better place.

01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:37.520
Whale...?

01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:42.610
It's dangerous, don't go that way!

01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:44.320
Run away quickly!

01:36:52.290 --> 01:36:53.000
What's this?

01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:54.460
A shadow?

01:37:06.150 --> 01:37:07.210
What's that?

01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.030
A whale...?

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.110
Get out of your cars! Just do it!

01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:40.200
Huh, what?!

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.010
Run away! Run away quickly!

01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:46.110
Run!

01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:50.260
Kaede!

01:38:11.410 --> 01:38:13.770
How can I defeat him...?

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.960
This way!

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:19.500
Where are we going?!

01:38:54.190 --> 01:38:57.790
How should I handle this?

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.960
If I open up my empty heart,

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.600
lock up all his darkness in there,

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.670
and stab myself, will it disappear with me?

01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:12.560
Is that the only option I have left?

01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:17.640
You see, I've been thinking about this since before.

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:22.730
Why did I grab your hand and run with you?

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.650
I was really scared, so why?

01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:30.740
Then I remembered.

01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:34.610
Around the time I first met you and we studied together,

01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:36.860
I was really happy.

01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:41.630
Because there's no one else who enjoys studying so much!

01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:47.000
Being with you encouraged me to do my best, too.

01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:50.230
And I still feel the same.

01:39:50.230 --> 01:39:53.800
If you're going to fight, I'll come with you.

01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:55.820
Don't forget.

01:39:55.820 --> 01:40:00.270
We never fight alone.

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:01.890
Kaede...

01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:04.730
To all passengers.

01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:07.870
Due to a fire at the Shibuya station,

01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:10.740
we must ask you to...

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.020
What are these tremors?

01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.100
Ichirouhiko is targeting Kyuuta...

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.060
and running wild in the human city.

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:25.120
Our worlds may be connected,

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.210
but for us to be affected this much...

01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:32.020
Why must we be involved in a dispute between humans?

01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:35.740
It was wrong to drag humans into our world in the first place.

01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:46.820
Hey Kumatetsu, don't push yourself or you'll die!

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:49.450
You're in no condition to move around!

01:40:49.450 --> 01:40:50.320
Shut up!

01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:52.480
I've heard what's going on.

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.060
I'll do something about it.

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.660
I will...

01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:57.480
Kumatetsu...

01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.450
What can you do?!

01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:02.250
Grandmaster, you're the only one...

01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:04.370
The only one who can do something about this.

01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:07.840
But you're keeping the method to yourself!

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:09.310
Method?

01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:10.840
What method is there?

01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:15.690
Kyuuta may think he can stand on his own,

01:41:15.690 --> 01:41:18.520
but he still needs someone to look out for him.

01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:24.900
I might be a blockhead, but I want to support him.

01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:29.150
What he lacks in his heart, I'll fill up.

01:41:29.610 --> 01:41:34.150
That's the one thing even a blockhead like me can do!

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:44.240
If you're saying something like this, that means...

01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:49.950
He's saying he wants me to hand over my right to reincarnate.

01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:52.310
He wants to reincarnate as a god?

01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:53.100
Ridiculous!

01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.460
That's not something ordinary beasts can do!

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:58.480
Only a grandmaster can do it!

01:42:00.850 --> 01:42:02.280
Right now...

01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.140
Kumatetsu is the grandmaster.

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.280
Listen well, Kumatetsu.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.890
Once done, there's no turning back.

01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:12.650
Do you still want to?

01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:15.240
Yeah...

01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:19.910
You really are something...

01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:23.540
There's not a glimpse of hesitation in your eyes.

01:42:37.130 --> 01:42:38.470
Ichirouhiko.

01:42:39.710 --> 01:42:40.760
He disappeared?

01:42:56.150 --> 01:42:57.190
Damn!

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.660
Look out!

01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:09.400
Run away, Kaede.

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:11.190
He's after me.

01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:13.380
Kaede!

01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:16.780
What is it you want?

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:19.010
To cut the opponent you detest into pieces?!

01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:22.180
Will you feel satisfaction from crushing him under your feet?!

01:43:22.670 --> 01:43:25.050
You may have taken that form,

01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:27.350
but you're just a human obsessed with revenge!

01:43:28.110 --> 01:43:30.890
Everyone has a some darkness in him!

01:43:31.190 --> 01:43:33.040
Ren-kun does, too!

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:33.900
Me, too!

01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:39.900
Even now, I'm struggling against it with all my strength.

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:46.210
That's why there's no way Ren-kun would lose to you,
who easily let himself be consumed by his darkness.

01:43:47.250 --> 01:43:49.500
There's no way we'll lose!

01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:54.040
Kaede!

01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:02.970
Ren-kun!

01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:04.470
I have no other choice.

01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:07.070
Ichirouhiko, look!

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:15.110
I'll take in all your darkness!

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:31.870
Ren-kun, could it be...

01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:38.800
Disappear along with me!

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.880
Ren-kun!

01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.300
You can't lose!

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:49.970
Kyuuta!

01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:05.760
What is this?

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:08.380
Kyuuta, that's Kumatetsu!

01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:10.050
"god of tool"
He reincarnated as a tsukumogami...

01:45:10.050 --> 01:45:12.040
and took on the shape of that sword!

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.460
This is... him?

01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:20.960
That idiot said he wants to become the sword in your heart!

01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:24.380
The sword in my heart?

01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:27.140
You have one in your heart, don't you?!

01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:28.930
Huh? How could I have such a thing?

01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:31.430
The sword in your heart is important!

01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:33.490
It's right here!

01:45:33.490 --> 01:45:35.180
Right here!

01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:46.360
I knew you had something in you!

01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:48.030
I'm starting to like you!

01:45:51.490 --> 01:45:53.580
All right, from now on, you're Kyuuta!

01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:58.480
All right, Kyuuta!

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.000
I'll train you thoroughly, prepare yourself!

01:46:19.210 --> 01:46:20.860
Kyuuta!

01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:22.440
What are you crying for, you idiot?

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:25.530
I hate whiny people!

01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:33.540
Shut up, I'm not crying!

01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:50.100
Gather your energy!

01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:52.890
Kyuuta.

01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:53.640
Ren-kun.

01:46:58.560 --> 01:46:59.700
Not yet!

01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:01.440
Hone it even further!

01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:08.150
What's that?

01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:21.850
Ichirouhiko appears for an instant before every leap.

01:47:21.850 --> 01:47:23.420
In that case...

01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:27.130
Choose one point to attack.

01:47:27.130 --> 01:47:29.340
Aim for it without hesitation!

01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:42.730
Now! Go!

01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:32.140
Did he finish it?

01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:33.180
No.

01:48:36.850 --> 01:48:42.160
Even though... you're just a human...

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:44.790
Ichirouhiko.

01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:47.230
We're the same.

01:48:51.090 --> 01:48:53.020
We were raised by beasts.

01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:54.470
We're the children of beasts.

01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:15.560
Where...

01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:18.380
...am I?

01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:24.120
Father, Mother, Jiroumaru.

01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:27.230
What was I doing till now...?

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.590
I remember going to the match with everyone...

01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:42.540
This is Kyuuta's...

01:49:58.090 --> 01:49:59.910
Do you understand, Kyuuta?

01:49:59.910 --> 01:50:03.410
I'm the type that doesn't change his mind once he's decided on something.

01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:06.250
I know.

01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:09.540
If you hesitate, I'll kick your ass from inside your heart!

01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:12.250
Shut up, I won't hesitate.

01:50:12.250 --> 01:50:14.060
That's the way.

01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:18.640
You just shut up and watch what I do.

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:21.680
Show me then.

01:50:46.710 --> 01:50:52.750
Last night, in Tokyo Shibuya, a driver-less truck caused an accident leading to a big explosion.

01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:56.580
During the evacuation, several people were injured,

01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:58.720
but the injuries were only minor.

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.860
According to the police, right before the accident,

01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:04.910
many witnesses reported seeing a whale-shaped shadow,

01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:07.310
but the security cameras didn't show anything of the like.

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.740
Take a good look.

01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:20.640
Even Kyuuta was once just a weak child.

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:25.380
In other words, if you keep up your daily training,

01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:28.120
you'll one day be able to stand on your own.

01:51:29.190 --> 01:51:32.620
Probably.

01:51:34.090 --> 01:51:39.430
I missed my chance to reincarnate as a god because of Kumatetsu.

01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:42.890
I have to go back to being the grandmaster...

01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:43.820
Now, now.

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:46.250
Today we celebrate for Kyuuta.

01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:47.550
Cheers!

01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:48.590
What?

01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:50.390
Oh, look at that!

01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:55.650
That girl is yet another one of those who support Kyuuta.

01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:59.360
Kaede, what are you doing here?

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.020
I've been invited.

01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:04.920
Ah, I had dropped this on the street.

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:06.720
Finding it was difficult.

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:07.830
Here, I'm returning it.

01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:10.410
Thanks.

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:13.500
And there's also the application for the entrance test.

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.670
Do you still feel like taking it?

01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:20.720
You have to make the decision yourself.

01:52:23.230 --> 01:52:24.180
I'll take it.

01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:26.560
Yes!

01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:28.520
That what I thought!

01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.420
Let's do our best together!

01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:32.880
I'm starting with the fireworks!

01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:05.050
Hey!

01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:16.240
After that, Kyuuta left Juutengai and never held a sword again.

01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:18.930
But there's no better swordsman.

01:53:18.930 --> 01:53:22.980
Yeah, he has a sword named Kumatetsu in his heart.

01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:25.450
He's a unique swordsman.

01:53:25.450 --> 01:53:29.610
No matter how hard it may become for him from now on,

01:53:29.610 --> 01:53:31.550
he'll definitely get through it.

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:41.690
