WEBVTT

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:07.965
A Nikkatsu Production

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:13.721
Presented in NikkatsuScope

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.772
Since before Lord Hideyoshi
built this castle 375 years ago,

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.275
Osaka has been
a centre for commerce,

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.402
famous for its dry humour.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.447
Thirteen years on from the War,

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.825
there are no longer signs of
the terrible devastation suffered,

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.787
and once again the Yodogawa
River Delta can boast

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:41.040
great wealth and prosperity.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:46.879
This tower stands as a symbol
both of Osaka's reconstruction

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.757
and its ancient past.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.258
Below the tower...

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.888
...in the ancient districts
of Settsu and Kawachi,

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.849
flourishes an earthy local people

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:04.438
stout of heart
and unchanged still to this day.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.319
Welcome, welcome!

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.363
Just in time for the show!

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.159
After a long absence,
we are back in Osaka.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:20.871
All our star actresses
are featured,

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:24.416
and scenes from The Tale of
the 47 Ronin will be performed.

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.835
One scene when the Lord
leaves his estate...

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.420
Welcome!

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:31.882
A slice of heaven
with beautiful girls!

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:36.887
They'll show you
the real stripping of Tokyo.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:41.350
The show's about to start.
Come on in and see!

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:46.105
They offer a student discount,

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:50.150
even though they get fewer
than two a year.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.361
OSAKA FLOWER FESTIVAL

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:57.032
However, if they're short of dancers
to show their bottoms on stage,

00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:01.453
they borrow the middle-aged
woman from the ticket office.

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:07.334
Such "tent theatres"
tour all around Osaka,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.004
their energy and vitality
almost frightening.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.134
About 50 of them visit
the Kawachi district alone every year.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:23.308
They're possessed by the muse,
these theatre folk,

00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:28.021
and they can survive
any stomping and kicking.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.650
They suffer neither
from breakdowns nor stress,

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:36.113
they live only for the stage
and probably will die on stage.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:41.702
Oh, we should be envious
of these folk!

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.121
The strip's almost finished.
Your turn, Boss.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.832
Kanji and Eisuke,
stand by, please.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.392
Hey, hang on!
The main act's next!

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:09.605
- It's a really funny play, folks!
- Tarry a while!

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:20.282
STOLEN DESIRE

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:45.307
Cast:

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:52.231
NAGATO Hiroyuki,
KATSUKI Minako, MINAMIDA Yoko

00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:59.279
TAKIZAWA Osamu,
NISHIMURA Ko, OZAWA Shoichi

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:42.281
Directed by IMAMURA Shohei

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:59.339
Bring forth Kakogawa Honzo.

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:04.261
I'll punish the disloyal counsellor
for you, my lord.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.179
I'll execute him.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.473
So he stood up.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.267
Wait, Banzaemon.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:14.646
- Don't stop me.
- No, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:18.608
There's no need to be hasty.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:25.198
I understand your hatred for Honzo,

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.827
but proffer me your sword.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:35.834
He slowly approached the garden,

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:43.633
and stepped down therein

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:50.182
He was prepared to be caught
but you were excellent,

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:53.602
Banzaemon.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:58.607
Well, I don't think
he had any choice...

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.277
- Hey, Kanji!
- Kanji!

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.279
Well, Honzo.

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:09.326
You deserved to be punished
for calling our lord a monster.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:14.581
They laughed at him

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.505
And the master stood,

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:27.260
drawing the sword
from its sheath

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.721
These are your last moments.

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:33.392
Prepare to die.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.313
Die! You're supposed to die.

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.148
What's he doing?

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:43.276
- Stop! Enough! That's it!
- What?

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.154
I'm taking a nap.
There's no audience!

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.074
- How dare you?
- Wait!

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.577
I'm not performing on stage
without any pay!

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:57.207
Oi! Pay me if you want me
to carry on!

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.544
What kind of actors are you?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.339
Let go!

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:08.760
Who said we could put a decent
play on the road with Tennoji?

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:12.389
But no violence, please?
No violence.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:16.184
- Is that so?
- Father!

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.450
- Are you all right?
- Pull yourself together.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:36.121
That's it!
That's the end of our theatre.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.748
Father, don't be silly.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:46.590
- Fool, that's your ma's
medicine! - Sorry, Father.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.593
Why don't you help
instead of laughing?

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.553
You're the troupe leader.

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:55.223
I can't get involved in a fight.

00:07:57.351 --> 00:08:02.355
We're not good enough to perform
kabuki in the new world.

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.693
It wasn't me who insisted
we all perform here.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:10.113
But you used to be
a big star in kabuki...

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:12.324
Shut up, Director!

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.452
But violence is our enemy.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.163
Our enemy is a boss
who doesn't pay us.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.832
And keep your mouth shut,
you beggar!

00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.793
- How dare you?
- Break it up!

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.924
Could you come? There's a guy
who wants his money back.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.094
- Have a little mercy. - Very
well, I'll settle for 10 yen.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.598
- We'll starve to death.
- Without 10 yen?

00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:39.935
Sorry, sir. Please accept
this 20-yen voucher.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.270
Take three, sir. Thank you!

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:44.981
Oh, what a day!

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:48.109
You've got the money in that box.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:52.322
- We can't perform on empty stomachs.
- I'm too hungry to do backflips.

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:56.117
What?
You never do backflips anyway.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:59.287
I might be his second wife,
but don't you look down on me!

00:08:59.413 --> 00:09:04.376
- Doesn't matter, second or third...
- Hands off, you thieves!

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:09.631
Listen up, everyone!
Our actors are robbing me...

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:11.341
Shut up!

00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:15.929
- I want my wages! I'm not stealing!
- Leave it!

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:20.433
Just try it, and I'll poke
your eye out with a needle!

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.020
- Stop this disgraceful scene!
- Keep out of it!

00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:27.023
- You were anti-violence before.
- That was then, this is different.

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:29.609
Stay out of it, you!

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.945
Keep away!

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.740
Just mind your own business, right?

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:39.327
- I understand your...
- Stay out of it.

00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:41.955
- Just be more sympathetic to her.
- What?

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:45.125
You should stay out of it!

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.918
You want a fight?

00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:51.464
My peace-making efforts are over.
I'll thrash all of you!

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:56.428
Who's first?
I'll beat the hell out of you!

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:57.929
Calm down.

00:09:58.055 --> 00:10:01.391
- Enough is enough!
- Don't get involved!

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:04.144
Stay away! I'll take them with me!

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.146
- No violence...
- Enough!

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.690
Restrain him, now!

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:11.693
Leave me alone.
You want a fight?

00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:14.738
- Behave yourself!
- What?

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.075
Oh, it's you.

00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:23.079
We have to talk.

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:26.041
- Come with me.
- What is it?

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.709
It won't take long.

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:42.515
Can you make a living with them?

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.226
Well, I'm not starving
to death yet.

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:52.192
You're wasting your talents
on such a beggars' theatre.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.362
It's none of your business.

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:02.243
Don't be angry.
It's a shame to waste your talent.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.747
Stop it. I like it with them.

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:09.250
- Liar.
- I'm not lying.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.673
These days, I trust only no-frills
theatre and no-frills audiences.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.841
No pretensions or showing off.

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.177
Sounds too good to be true.

00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:21.596
You must have a woman there.

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.724
Don't be stupid.

00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:38.321
Nothing wrong with that,
I fall for women too easily.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.283
Hey, won't you join our company?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.204
- Oh, that TV stuff?
- Don't sound so contemptuous.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.249
It's better than
that beggars' theatre.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.377
Take this with you
to the Head of Directors.

00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:55.380
He's expecting you this evening.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.549
But I...

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:02.721
Listen, all our old friends
are doing really well.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:07.142
Urayama won the Literature Award
and Oki got the Theatre Award.

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.602
You're the only one
doing nothing.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.231
- But...
- Don't be so stubborn.

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:15.066
Not for me.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:40.175
I'm sorry you had
to pawn everything.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.093
Not at all.

00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:47.056
You've had to suffer
father's stubbornness.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:50.310
Everyone was so patient with us
when we had little money.

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:54.939
It's a godsend for us now,

00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:57.275
considering we were begging before.

00:12:57.401 --> 00:13:01.154
Sayoko, come to bed.

00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:04.699
Keep this on you all the time.

00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:07.494
Does it really make
your nose more defined?

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.330
- Of course.
- I'm going to bed.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.123
Good night.

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:23.760
What've you been up to,
Mr Kunida?

00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:28.556
I'm not drunk at all.

00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:31.059
You've colour in your face.

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:32.310
Listen...

00:13:33.103 --> 00:13:36.564
I'm leaving the theatre company
when this run is over.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.151
That's all a bit sudden.

00:13:40.277 --> 00:13:44.113
A friend from a TV station
has persuaded me,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.159
he said I'd waste my life
if I stayed here.

00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:50.537
We'll be at a loss without you.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.580
How do you mean?

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:55.583
At last, everybody's started afresh,

00:13:55.709 --> 00:14:00.088
and we're all rehearsing well
since you joined us.

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:03.132
If you leave, we'll just
go back to the way we were.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.051
You'll survive without me.

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:07.345
The Boss and Kanji are good actors,

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:11.266
and your husband's got the looks.

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:21.234
You know, your friend may be right...

00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:29.701
This is no place for a
university graduate like you.

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:35.206
Even so, I love it dearly.

00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:47.135
I can't leave here, no matter
how hard he tries to persuade me.

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.928
It's impossible to leave!

00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:53.391
Tell me, Chidori,
what should I do?

00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:55.059
I don't know.

00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:57.645
You decide and I'll be...

00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:59.188
Big sis?

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:03.651
What are you two talking about
in the dark? It looks suspicious!

00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:07.155
I'm chatting her up,
so don't interrupt.

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.740
Mr Kunida!

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:12.243
Mr Kunida's leaving us.

00:15:12.369 --> 00:15:14.078
Oh, really?

00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:18.249
You intellectuals can be
such cowards.

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:22.670
- That's not true! - You'll
have to take me with you.

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:26.215
- Chigusa!
- Everyone knows I like him.

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.468
All right, Kunida?

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.428
I'm ready for bed.

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.348
You, too.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:37.352
You coward, wooing a married
woman in the dark!

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.688
You may actually win her over.

00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:44.233
I'm not losing you to anybody.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.571
Chidori doesn't care
about me at all.

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:50.698
I don't know about that.

00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:53.284
She calls your name in her sleep.

00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:59.582
Don't look so happy!

00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:03.419
It was a joke! Go to bed.

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:12.261
What heartache!

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:16.057
- Careful!
- Careful...

00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:19.686
- Are you all right?
- My heart aches.

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:36.661
- Oi!
- It's here.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:41.499
- What?
- What's going on?

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:46.212
Earthquake! It's an earthquake!

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:03.021
- There they are!
- What a sight.

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:06.441
What an eyeful!

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:09.485
I'll get you!

00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:12.780
Idiot!
You're just dirty old men!

00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:16.367
Oi, you lot on the roof!
What are you doing?

00:17:16.493 --> 00:17:20.204
That's a bit barbaric,
arriving suddenly like this!

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.332
Theatres with no audience
have to close.

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:27.128
- Let go of me!
- But we have one more day.

00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:30.715
Shut up! It's none of my business.

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:33.760
We need the tent
for the Health Exhibition.

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.721
Complain to the promoter, not me.

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:39.390
- Don't be so heartless.
- Clear off!

00:17:39.516 --> 00:17:43.144
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up!

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.480
Come on, we're pressed for time!

00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:03.372
As you can see,

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:07.210
my selfishness has cost you all.

00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:11.464
I couldn't pay
the rest of your wages,

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.342
but I'm sure better days will come.

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.302
We'll meet again some time.

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:19.430
What are you going to do?

00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:24.644
I know some promoters
who owe me a favour in Nakakochi.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.523
I'll start again
with some young actors.

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.775
Will you keep going?

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:34.529
Putting on plays
is the only thing I know.

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:38.699
- We're just the same.
- Indeed we are!

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:45.289
It'd be heartless of you to recruit
amateurs and leave us out of it.

00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:47.375
- Cold-hearted.
- Merciless.

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:51.129
But we don't want
to make you suffer...

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:55.883
You don't understand.
That's why we'll come with you.

00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:58.427
We'll follow you until we get paid.

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:01.472
- Is that so?
- Yeah!

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.892
I'm with you.

00:19:05.018 --> 00:19:07.103
How about you,
Eisuke and Tomihachi?

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:09.564
- I agree.
- We're coming.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.274
Come with us, Director!

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.402
But you have that TV job...

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:18.239
Don't be silly.
I want to get my wages.

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:22.034
Thanks for saying that.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.620
Your pay will be doubled!

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:27.415
Don't talk nonsense!

00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:31.627
We'll have to do it!
We'll pay double!

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:48.060
Could it be that one?

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.354
It's so far.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.068
Let's ask him.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.988
Excuse me,
I'd like to ask you something...

00:19:59.114 --> 00:20:02.658
- What is it?
- Where's Yamanami's?

00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:04.493
What's it about?

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.412
We want to borrow a tent.

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:08.539
Are you actors, then?

00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:13.794
We open from tonight.
Come and see the performance.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:18.674
"The Yamamura Theatre's
Surprise Visit."

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.676
Where's Yamanami's?

00:20:20.802 --> 00:20:24.430
He sold the tent
to Fujita last year.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.310
So tell us where Fujita's is, then?

00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:33.564
Go north for 100 metres. It's
a brush factory on the east side.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.650
Up this street!

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.069
Who was that?

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:40.321
Funny fella, indeed.

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:57.129
Did you see that?

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.381
Gorgeous!

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:01.342
This way! This way!
Where are you going?

00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:05.346
Shame...

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:20.736
Hey, this sounds like fun!
A theatre!

00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:24.073
- A theatre's arrived.
- Where?

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:26.284
Don't tear it!

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.036
I've got more here.

00:21:29.162 --> 00:21:33.416
It'll be a good one. Beautiful
actresses, all dressed up.

00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:36.419
- Actresses as well?
- Of course!

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:40.339
A fresh young girl asked me,
"Could you tell me...?"

00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:43.301
- Did you speak to her?
- Of course I did.

00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:47.471
I told her Fujita's was north,
on the east side.

00:21:47.597 --> 00:21:51.559
No way! Fujita's lies on the south.
You got it the wrong way round.

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:56.772
You don't understand. Actors need
hardship to improve their art.

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:01.193
- Do you want one?
- What?

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.404
"The Yamamura Theatre's
Surprise Visit."

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.198
Tell me, when is it?

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:08.701
Read it! It starts tonight.

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:10.911
Tonight? I'll have to hurry.

00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:13.748
- Come on.
- What's that, dear?

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:37.980
- What are you doing? - Could
you stew some dried gourd?

00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:39.523
Gourd?

00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:42.026
You don't think ahead, do you?

00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:45.571
We can make sushi
and sell it at the theatre.

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:50.076
- I see. I'll make Coca-Cola
then. - Coca... what?

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:53.162
Coca-Cola, it's an American
fizzy drink.

00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:56.040
But we don't have the ingredients.

00:22:56.166 --> 00:23:00.795
No problem. It's just like mint
soda mixed with Chinese medicine.

00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:04.006
Can we sell that?

00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:08.219
Don't worry, it's medicine.
I'll get some now.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.306
She's a mercenary one.

00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:14.350
Thank you.

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:17.561
Be careful, there are dodgy
sorts around these parts.

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:19.105
Thank you so much.

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:22.108
Wait a minute!

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:26.445
Have you any complimentary tickets?

00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:33.119
- What a chore.
- Indeed...

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.121
Here it is!

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:41.085
"Fujita Brush Factory."
This is it.

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:42.420
At last!

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.258
Excuse me, young lady!

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.013
- Is the master at home?
- No, but the young master is.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.266
Could you take us to him?

00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:58.686
We're from this theatre company.

00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:02.648
Take it instead of
my business card.

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:06.402
This way.

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:08.154
Follow her.

00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:12.533
- What's your name, honey?
- Misako.

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:16.245
- Cute name. And where
do you live? - Just here.

00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:19.540
I don't have any family
so I live and work here.

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:21.417
Such a pity.

00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:24.086
You're too beautiful for that.

00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:26.338
- You could be an actress.
- Or a geisha.

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.549
- Shut up!
- What?

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:32.136
- I'm home!
- Welcome back!

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.680
- Who's that?
- Who are those men?

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:37.266
They're actors. Look...

00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:41.187
- It's true!
- Actors!

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:48.194
I'm lead actor, Takada Kanji.
My respects, ladies.

00:24:49.404 --> 00:24:55.367
And I'm Kato Eisuke.
I look forward to your patronage.

00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:57.411
Misako!

00:24:57.537 --> 00:25:01.207
- The young master is here.
- Thank you.

00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:03.626
We'll perform a period piece.

00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:09.840
I saw you in Osaka.

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:14.678
Did you come to return
the 10 yen to me?

00:25:14.804 --> 00:25:17.181
- Where are the actresses?
- Wait till tonight!

00:25:18.683 --> 00:25:20.351
Quieten down!

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:31.612
You want us to erect a tent
and lease it to you at 2 percent?

00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:35.699
It's the going rate.
Yamanami will give us a tip.

00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:39.620
We have a different way
of doing things.

00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:42.414
- I want 3 percent.
- How mercenary!

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:47.086
- I have to make a profit.
- We won't break even!

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:51.549
Hardship makes you a better
person. 3 percent or nothing.

00:25:51.675 --> 00:25:56.053
Oi, you. Do you know
how cruel you're being?

00:25:56.179 --> 00:25:58.264
Just lend it to us.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.268
Over my dead body!
Three percent is my final offer.

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.770
Give up and go home, if you want!

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:08.399
- What...?
- The actresses are coming!

00:26:36.303 --> 00:26:38.137
Hey! Stop!

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:42.641
Stop! Wait!

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:47.187
- How did it go?
- He won't lend it to us!

00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:49.607
The promoter's refused.

00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:51.817
There's no stage for tonight!

00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:03.120
Listen, it's all Toshiro's fault!

00:27:03.246 --> 00:27:06.665
Kawachi is the home
of the performing arts.

00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:09.835
We could help you actors out.

00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:14.965
What other reason is there
to live in Kawachi?

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.389
- We want to see their play.
- Lend them the tent.

00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:26.685
You're not going to lose out
to those people,

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:29.647
you'll make a profit with 2 percent.

00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:31.982
Don't be greedy!

00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:34.652
That's true.

00:27:36.988 --> 00:27:39.740
I'll lend it to you, then!

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:43.327
Make sure you all go to see it!

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:55.297
- Let's get on with it, then.
- Very well.

00:27:55.423 --> 00:27:58.384
The villagers will help,
that'll save on labour costs.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.843
Good idea.

00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:04.223
I'll pay the ground rent
in advance!

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:08.310
- Where?
- Over in that paddy field.

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:38.632
Actors: Yamamura Chigusa
& Taminosuke, Takada Kanji

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.627
Thanks for coming.

00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:32.728
Let the kids in. Some companies
make a fortune from them.

00:29:32.854 --> 00:29:34.438
Go, go.

00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:37.107
Thanks for coming.

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:39.818
Hey, lad.

00:29:41.654 --> 00:29:44.698
- Is this valid?
- You've still got it?

00:29:44.824 --> 00:29:47.576
Of course. Cheers!

00:29:47.702 --> 00:29:50.287
20 yen discount vouchers
for 10 yen!

00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:52.998
- I'll buy one!
- I'll have one, too!

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.708
Oh, Misako...

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.921
Only 5 yen for you, Misako.

00:29:59.047 --> 00:30:01.507
Really? Thanks.

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.052
Oh, Misako!

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:09.348
He's more cunning than I am.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:15.437
Sushi and sweet buns!
Sushi and sweet buns!

00:30:21.861 --> 00:30:23.445
Is it all right to sell those?

00:30:23.571 --> 00:30:26.281
Of course.
Nobody'll get tummy ache.

00:30:26.407 --> 00:30:28.951
I see, I see.

00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:31.787
Thank you. This one?

00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:34.456
There you go. Thanks.

00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:37.960
Sushi, sweet buns and peanuts!

00:30:48.012 --> 00:30:51.932
It's great to see a full house
for a change.

00:30:52.058 --> 00:30:54.142
We've got three days guaranteed.

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:59.731
Boss, can I play the role
of Sakura Sogo tomorrow?

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:02.734
- In the new version?
- Yes.

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:07.781
Let's leave it till next time.
They're happy with the programme.

00:31:07.907 --> 00:31:10.158
We'll rehearse your version.

00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:15.747
But if you pander to the audience,
your art won't improve at all.

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:18.750
The people of Kawachi love plays.

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:22.004
They'll come if it's not
too difficult to understand.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.505
In theory, yes...

00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:26.925
- Boss!
- It's curtain up.

00:31:28.011 --> 00:31:29.887
You just take it easy.

00:31:35.935 --> 00:31:38.103
Everybody ready?

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.940
It's as good as
the Takarazuka Theatre.

00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:25.192
There's no need
to see that after this.

00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:28.695
It's just perverted, isn't it?

00:32:28.821 --> 00:32:32.491
- Is that what men are into?
- Yeah, that's men for you!

00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:43.377
Great tits!

00:32:43.503 --> 00:32:47.339
- Too tempting!
- I prefer small tits.

00:32:58.142 --> 00:33:02.771
Ochiyo, this evening, I,
Rakunosuke will entertain you.

00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:05.190
Father!

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.235
Hands off her!

00:33:09.696 --> 00:33:11.321
Father!

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:14.449
Please, have mercy.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.215
- What's it to you?
- Who are you?

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:35.012
- And your name is...?
- Yosabu... Idiot!

00:33:35.138 --> 00:33:39.725
You're in grave danger
if you get in our way.

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.226
Let's do him!

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:46.231
I, Harutaro, will take you on
if you insist.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:49.151
- Look after this!
- Give it to me.

00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:50.527
Get him!

00:34:07.754 --> 00:34:10.797
Behind you! Behind you!

00:34:10.923 --> 00:34:12.674
Stop him!

00:34:16.763 --> 00:34:18.638
Take that!

00:34:19.265 --> 00:34:20.932
Ouch!

00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:40.410
Thank you very much!

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:50.629
- You've really raked
in the money! - Well!

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:54.591
- Don't forget backstage, too.
- Well!

00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:58.386
See you later on.

00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:04.351
Listen to your obscene voice,
it's like a strangled duck.

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:14.111
Even a 100-yen bonus
makes the world seem sweeter.

00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:16.822
You're right. The world is rosy.

00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:47.269
How about the repertoire
we discussed earlier...?

00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:49.521
Later. Have a drink first.

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:53.733
- Let's discuss the repertoire
first. - Come on, down it in one.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.236
Let's celebrate a full house.

00:35:56.362 --> 00:35:57.696
No, thanks.

00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:00.490
- What's your problem?
- Not now.

00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:04.369
- Let's sort the repertoire first.
- Mr Kunida...

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.541
Well, just the one, then.

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:26.600
- What's up with that fellow?
- What a fool!

00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:30.604
Don't worry.
He'll take care of things.

00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:36.276
Mr Kunida?

00:36:37.236 --> 00:36:39.237
- What?
- Burn some more wood.

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:41.406
- No.
- Don't be mean!

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:43.491
You want to see me bathe?

00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:45.619
I will then!

00:37:06.849 --> 00:37:10.644
Listen, all our old friends
are doing really well.

00:37:11.437 --> 00:37:13.688
You're the only one
doing nothing.

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:28.119
- Peeping through here?
- Yes. Five or six of them.

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:30.747
- What perverts! - What could
possibly interest them?

00:37:30.873 --> 00:37:34.751
- Well, it's understandable...
- As if the strip wasn't enough!

00:37:34.877 --> 00:37:36.211
Disgusting, really.

00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:38.213
Report it to the police.

00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:42.884
What are you doing?
You're just as bad!

00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:46.429
Wait.

00:37:46.555 --> 00:37:48.932
Aren't you worried at all?

00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:53.979
- Mr Kunida!
- Leave him be for tonight.

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.106
Why? Something happened?

00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:58.358
I saw her! I saw her!

00:37:58.484 --> 00:38:00.902
Don't run so fast!

00:38:01.862 --> 00:38:04.239
She was a brave girl,
pouring hot water over herself!

00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:06.950
Purifying herself for us!

00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:12.414
It's freezing!

00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:32.851
"Beggars' theatre"?

00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:40.567
What on earth am I doing?

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:49.409
Fool!

00:38:49.535 --> 00:38:51.202
Idiot!

00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:58.251
Fool!

00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:16.353
Take that!

00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:17.979
Idiot!

00:39:31.994 --> 00:39:34.037
Chigusa...

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.213
You weakling!

00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:47.884
What are you doing?

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.804
I love you, I love you.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.555
I won't let anybody else have you.

00:39:52.681 --> 00:39:55.517
Hold me, Shinkichi. Hold me!

00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:05.485
Are you all right with this?

00:40:05.611 --> 00:40:08.446
I'm just happy.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.910
You don't know anything.

00:40:14.036 --> 00:40:19.040
I want to know, I want to
experience it all with you.

00:40:27.049 --> 00:40:29.050
Kunida...

00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:15.680
It's started raining, dear.

00:41:17.558 --> 00:41:19.100
Darling?

00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:22.020
Hey!

00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:01.476
It's raining.

00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:04.521
Is that rain?

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.719
Bloody rain!

00:42:36.845 --> 00:42:41.140
Typical! It starts raining
as soon as we get a full house.

00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:43.309
Chigusa's still asleep.

00:42:43.435 --> 00:42:46.563
She's fine.
Leave her a bit longer.

00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:52.569
- The rain's died down a bit.
- Indeed.

00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:55.154
It may clear up by noon.

00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:57.991
You're such an optimist.

00:42:58.117 --> 00:42:59.492
Why?

00:42:59.618 --> 00:43:04.622
They just said it on the radio:
"Continuous rain all day."

00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:08.126
Is it Sunday today?

00:43:09.295 --> 00:43:10.878
A dismal Sunday...

00:43:44.246 --> 00:43:45.705
Good morning.

00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:49.250
- Running away from me?
- How so?

00:43:49.376 --> 00:43:52.337
You're leaving
as soon as you set eyes on me.

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.255
I didn't mean anything by it...

00:43:55.883 --> 00:43:58.801
I couldn't sleep
a wink last night.

00:43:58.927 --> 00:44:00.678
Why's that?

00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:02.180
It's Chigusa.

00:44:03.057 --> 00:44:04.974
Don't hide it, I know.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:09.312
Shinkichi, I want you
to make her happy.

00:44:10.898 --> 00:44:16.778
Last night, I was convinced
I could make her happy.

00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:19.864
- But...
- But?

00:44:22.868 --> 00:44:25.953
But I wouldn't make myself happy.

00:44:44.056 --> 00:44:45.848
Good morning.

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:47.892
Morning.

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:50.103
First come, first served.

00:44:50.229 --> 00:44:51.896
Have some pickles.

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:55.358
Tomihachi, don't
show it to everyone!

00:44:55.484 --> 00:44:58.486
That's the egg
the Coca-Cola lady gave you.

00:44:58.612 --> 00:45:01.447
I'm single,
so I am entitled to it.

00:45:01.573 --> 00:45:04.033
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:08.246
Don't be so jealous!

00:45:10.582 --> 00:45:12.375
- Morning.
- Good morning.

00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:15.670
The women are going fishing
after this, all right?

00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:18.089
You can catch our supper for us.

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:21.134
- Please start, everyone.
- Thank you!

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.095
- Eizaburo!
- We've come to see you!

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:27.390
- Show us your faces, girls!
- Eizaburo!

00:45:27.516 --> 00:45:31.519
Excuse me.
Let me finish my breakfast first.

00:45:31.645 --> 00:45:34.480
- Eat up quickly!
- We'll wait.

00:45:38.485 --> 00:45:42.196
That's it from our
"Best Music Library".

00:45:42.322 --> 00:45:44.323
And now, the weather report.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:47.410
The Osaka region:
rain with south-easterly winds...

00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:48.953
Bloody radio!

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:52.081
...continuous rain
throughout the day...

00:45:53.292 --> 00:45:57.128
- Useless weather forecast.
- That's enough.

00:45:59.298 --> 00:46:03.134
Let's have a rehearsal today.

00:46:03.635 --> 00:46:07.972
Mr Kunida, what was it you mentioned,
a new version of the Sakura play?

00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:10.349
- Yes.
- Shall we try it out?

00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:14.729
- Shall we put it on tonight?
- Sounds good. What do you think?

00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:16.981
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:19.150
Big sis will play Osan, won't she?

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:21.235
Well, she's the wife
of the main character Sogoro.

00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:25.990
That's the only female role. There's
nothing seductive about the play!

00:46:26.116 --> 00:46:30.161
Well, that sounds no good.
Best not do it then.

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:34.415
The Love Suicides at Sonezaki
won't require any rehearsal.

00:46:34.541 --> 00:46:38.085
- Yes, but we're doing it
to rehearse. - But Mr Kunida...

00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:42.131
We won't improve if we take it
easy whenever the weather's bad.

00:46:42.257 --> 00:46:45.134
If you want to put a good
play on, you'd better...

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.761
All right, all right.

00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:49.347
How about combining the two?

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:51.140
That's absurd, combining them...

00:46:51.266 --> 00:46:53.476
It's up to you to do it.

00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:56.479
Listen, I've got an idea!

00:46:56.605 --> 00:47:00.149
Ohatsu of Tenmaya
can play Sogo's daughter.

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:04.070
- You're brilliant!
- Sounds interesting.

00:47:04.196 --> 00:47:07.740
It'll be a big hit,
we'll get twice the audience.

00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:15.665
Right, I'll try it
if you want to do it.

00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:19.794
Assemble on stage at 3.00pm.
I'll start now.

00:47:22.548 --> 00:47:25.341
Give me another big bowlful.

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:32.014
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.516
That's not right.

00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:35.393
One, two, three, four...

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:38.437
Don't move! Five, six, seven...

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.983
What a disaster!

00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:45.278
- There it is!
- I can't catch it.

00:47:45.404 --> 00:47:48.072
Here it is!

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:51.659
- There, there.
- I can't get it!

00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:54.704
- Are you all right?
- I'm exhausted.

00:47:56.665 --> 00:47:58.708
What's that?

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:03.087
- What are they doing there?
- They're browsing.

00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:04.755
Cheapskate perverts!

00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:07.633
Never mind. Just ignore them
and get on with it.

00:48:07.759 --> 00:48:09.760
Dirty old men!

00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:12.763
That one! She's got the biggest!

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.099
No, the third from the right!

00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:20.396
Oi! What have you done
with my goose?

00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:22.481
One's definitely missing.

00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:26.235
Hey, we might be out of work,
but don't treat us like thieves.

00:48:26.361 --> 00:48:31.032
I heard you strangled
and ate the midwife's dog.

00:48:31.158 --> 00:48:33.701
That was three years ago.

00:48:33.827 --> 00:48:39.040
It's your fault, you starve them.
They escape to find food!

00:48:39.166 --> 00:48:42.293
Have pity on the poor goose!

00:48:43.462 --> 00:48:44.921
That's nonsense.

00:48:45.672 --> 00:48:47.465
Officer!

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:49.592
Help me out here!

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.931
My poor goose,
where have you got to?

00:49:12.574 --> 00:49:14.533
Oh, it's so cold.

00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:20.164
- Let's eat!
- Calm down.

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.792
I found it.

00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:25.419
That's a good excuse.

00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:28.214
That's the truth.
I didn't nick it.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:32.468
I saw it on the road,
begging me to take it somewhere.

00:49:32.594 --> 00:49:34.095
It's all the same.

00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:36.847
Let's eat or we'll be late
for rehearsal.

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:39.100
We need to be there at 3.00.

00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:41.310
It's just a hobby
for him, cocky git.

00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:44.271
- You're not going?
- Course not.

00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:46.649
The Boss isn't that keen either.

00:49:47.776 --> 00:49:49.735
As for Tomihachi,

00:49:49.861 --> 00:49:54.073
he's shacking up
with that Coca-Cola hag,

00:49:54.199 --> 00:49:57.660
giving her a massage
in exchange for you know what!

00:49:59.871 --> 00:50:02.289
How does that feel there?

00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:04.458
- Wonderful.
- Really?

00:50:06.878 --> 00:50:10.423
Actors are so skilful
with their hands.

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:15.136
Your body is so flexible,
perfect for massage.

00:50:17.305 --> 00:50:23.102
Widows like me must seem
a little coquettish to you.

00:50:23.228 --> 00:50:24.478
Don't be silly!

00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:29.275
A resourceful widow like you
must have so many admirers.

00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:31.235
You're a man-eater!

00:50:36.324 --> 00:50:37.616
Do tell! Do tell!

00:50:37.743 --> 00:50:41.162
"A resourceful widow like you
must have so many admirers."

00:50:41.288 --> 00:50:43.247
"You're a man-eater!"

00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:51.255
Kanji's better than him.

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:54.842
No, Eizaburo is far nicer than him.

00:50:55.844 --> 00:50:57.762
But his acting is better.

00:50:57.888 --> 00:51:02.308
- Excuse me. - Oh! We were
just talking about you.

00:51:02.434 --> 00:51:04.643
Oh? That's good.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:09.774
I couldn't walk past without
saying hello to my beautiful girls.

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:41.514
Boss, what happened to everyone?

00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:46.644
They didn't feel like doing it.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.104
But...

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:51.607
I can't rehearse without them.

00:51:53.735 --> 00:51:58.280
But how does that make you feel?
Are you fine with that?

00:51:58.406 --> 00:52:00.199
- No, I...
- Answer me!

00:52:00.325 --> 00:52:03.577
- Don't talk to him like that.
- Mother!

00:52:03.703 --> 00:52:05.955
Now I've lost count!

00:52:07.499 --> 00:52:10.209
Of course I'm not happy about it.

00:52:10.335 --> 00:52:14.130
But there's no use getting angry.
Show me your notes.

00:52:14.256 --> 00:52:16.215
- There's no need now!
- Mr Kunida.

00:52:16.341 --> 00:52:19.468
Who said, "Every day matters
to a tent theatre"?

00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:24.682
I thought everyone in your company
loved performing,

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:28.394
I thought that was all they
lived for, no matter what.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.562
Mr Kunida, you...

00:52:29.688 --> 00:52:32.481
Instead, you'd prefer
to let a day go to waste.

00:52:32.607 --> 00:52:33.774
But...

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.734
Boss...

00:52:35.861 --> 00:52:39.488
Did you lose your spirit
after failing in Osaka?

00:52:39.614 --> 00:52:42.032
Do you think
too much of the others?

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:45.077
You'll have trouble
if the actors leave,

00:52:45.203 --> 00:52:47.621
actors like Kanji and Eisuke.

00:52:47.747 --> 00:52:50.332
Performances depend on rehearsals.

00:52:51.418 --> 00:52:55.713
It takes blood, sweat and tears
to make a good play. But you...

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:59.133
Enough!
Do you preach to Buddha?

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:02.720
Yes, to Buddha or to the devil!

00:53:05.557 --> 00:53:08.517
You don't understand the strain!

00:53:08.643 --> 00:53:10.561
I've been around for 40 years...

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.188
Father!

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:15.149
Shinkichi!

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.751
Mr Kunida?

00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:38.589
I'm sorry about my father.

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:42.218
He's trying his best.

00:53:42.344 --> 00:53:44.345
Please forgive him.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.180
Chidori...

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:50.267
Are you satisfied with it too?

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.312
Being with this gutless company?

00:53:55.190 --> 00:54:00.110
I was suffocated by modern society
which seemed so full of lies,

00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:03.239
and I joined you after leaving
university and the New Drama movement.

00:54:04.282 --> 00:54:06.659
Here, it's nothing to do
with family or connections,

00:54:06.785 --> 00:54:08.494
all that matters is one's skill.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.829
- But...
- I'm just speaking my mind!

00:54:10.956 --> 00:54:13.582
I thought we could challenge
everything with our art.

00:54:13.708 --> 00:54:15.960
Please be patient.

00:54:16.962 --> 00:54:19.380
You don't need to apologise.

00:54:20.382 --> 00:54:21.966
I was wrong.

00:54:28.974 --> 00:54:30.474
You're all just barnstormers.

00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:34.270
A beggars' theatre,
as people call it.

00:54:34.396 --> 00:54:37.273
It's a waste of time
talking to the boss.

00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:42.278
Right, leave now.

00:54:42.404 --> 00:54:46.198
Who knows what might happen
to a lone woman in a man's tent?

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.756
What's wrong with her?

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:10.639
What were you doing alone with her?

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.018
Mr Kunida?

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.648
Where are you off to?

00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:24.486
Where are you going
without an umbrella?

00:55:24.612 --> 00:55:26.613
I'm going for a drink.

00:55:54.893 --> 00:55:58.437
- He's very professional.
- He's got a wide repertoire.

00:56:00.815 --> 00:56:02.232
Okin!

00:56:04.235 --> 00:56:06.904
I'm coming!

00:56:08.907 --> 00:56:11.158
A party in the daytime?

00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:14.203
The audience drank
35 bottles of soda.

00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:17.790
We sold seventy rice crackers
and there's no peanuts left.

00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:19.583
That's all right, then.

00:56:29.344 --> 00:56:33.097
Hey, that old actor's here again.

00:56:33.223 --> 00:56:35.933
Are you going to marry
that good-for-nothing?

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.726
He's not a good-for-nothing.

00:56:37.852 --> 00:56:40.938
He's good at massage
and good with a brush.

00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:42.481
Yeah, but...

00:56:42.607 --> 00:56:45.734
How old do you think he is?

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.029
- He's already 64.
- So what?

00:56:49.155 --> 00:56:51.323
I'll take out
life insurance on him.

00:56:51.449 --> 00:56:55.244
It'll pay off within 10 years
and I'll be made.

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.372
I see what you mean.

00:57:04.963 --> 00:57:08.924
You aren't taking out
insurance on me, are you?

00:57:20.562 --> 00:57:23.439
Officer, just throw me in prison.

00:57:23.565 --> 00:57:25.190
What are you saying?

00:57:25.316 --> 00:57:27.943
I want to go to a land
that knows no theatre,

00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:30.529
to a land that
knows no love affairs.

00:57:30.655 --> 00:57:32.990
There's no need to cry!

00:57:33.992 --> 00:57:35.909
What a pain in the arse!

00:57:36.035 --> 00:57:37.161
Stand up!

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.499
See? Just put me in custody.

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:44.209
Let me stay here tonight.

00:57:44.335 --> 00:57:46.920
Hey, hey!
Where are you going?

00:57:47.046 --> 00:57:50.048
Oh, dear.
What are you doing here?

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:54.845
- Chidori!
- It's not big sis, it's me!

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:57.556
- Sorry to have troubled you.
- Chidori.

00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:59.600
Let's go.

00:58:01.102 --> 00:58:03.687
- Take this with you.
- Thank you.

00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:07.566
- I want to tell you how I feel.
- Fine, fine.

00:58:07.692 --> 00:58:10.903
- My true feelings...
- Let's go.

00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:13.739
- Thanks!
- Thanks!

00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:15.032
Good night!

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:21.038
Take care. There's all
sorts of strange folk about.

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:22.539
Goodbye!

00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:37.346
Misako's leaving with that actor.

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.974
- Shall we follow them?
- Let's go.

00:58:50.235 --> 00:58:53.779
The owner of the tent
proposed to you?

00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:56.240
Yes. He's so persistent.

00:58:56.366 --> 00:59:00.953
You should marry him
and then spend the miser's money.

00:59:01.079 --> 00:59:03.956
I'm being serious!

00:59:04.415 --> 00:59:08.252
I can't imagine marrying
into such a strict family.

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:11.296
Are you determined to join us?

00:59:11.422 --> 00:59:12.839
Yes.

00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:14.967
It's not an easy life.

00:59:15.093 --> 00:59:18.762
The reality falls far short
of its reputation, you know?

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:21.306
- I'm fine with that.
- Come with me, then.

00:59:22.976 --> 00:59:25.018
I'll give you a test.

00:59:43.621 --> 00:59:45.622
Here we are. Come in.

00:59:58.553 --> 01:00:00.971
- Is this real?
- Yes.

01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:07.477
What are you doing?

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:11.189
Take your clothes off.

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:13.442
I'm telling you to strip off.

01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:16.570
I need to see your body.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:20.240
Hurry up.

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:38.008
Your name's Misako, right?

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.803
How can I explain this...?

01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:44.139
To show a human body's...

01:00:44.265 --> 01:00:48.477
To show off 100% of
a beautiful form,

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:51.980
you have to at least get naked.

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:53.273
Understand?

01:00:53.399 --> 01:00:55.567
Then get naked, come on!

01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:58.904
- I have to take this
off as well? - Of course!

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.865
You can use false tits these days.

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.408
Take it off!

01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:07.954
What's going on?

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.832
We're at a critical moment.

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:12.417
I want to see!

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:15.337
Let's see,
I've fancied her for so long.

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:18.924
- Misako...
- No way, you dirty old man!

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:23.136
I'll make you an actress,
just leave everything to me.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:27.015
Do you mean it?

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:35.273
- Is this part of the test?
- I guess so...

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:39.069
Somebody's coming!

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:47.035
Oh, no, someone's coming.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.331
This way! Let's get away!

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:57.963
Some old codger ended up drunk,
ended up wasted and ended up dead!

01:01:58.089 --> 01:02:01.258
- Where's that old codger?
- This way!

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.928
That's not the end of it!

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:07.723
Some old codger ended up drunk,
ended up wasted...

01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:10.058
Stand up.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:13.311
Why are you pulling my arm?

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.105
But...

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:20.152
You may hurt yourself.

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:22.279
Let's go back.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.158
Shinkichi...

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:30.328
I'm free. I don't belong to no one!

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:33.665
- Shinkichi...
- I'm my own person!

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:40.088
You fool!

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:47.471
Some old codger ended up drunk,
ended up wasted...

01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:54.561
Well, that's it for tonight.

01:02:54.687 --> 01:02:57.105
- Let's go.
- Where to?

01:02:57.231 --> 01:02:59.691
To see the boss, of course.

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:02.527
You've got a good memory.

01:03:02.653 --> 01:03:05.030
- Come with me.
- Please!

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:08.200
- Miss!
- Come on!

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:23.089
What a surprise! Is Misako
dancing in the strip show?

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:27.052
She's got a great body,
all the right bumps and curves.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.429
That's not the point.

01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:32.432
We can't just sit by and
watch actors steal our women.

01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:34.351
Shall we make a claim?

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:37.187
You're not that bright, are you?

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.530
- Are you sure...?
- Shush, you idiot!

01:04:00.294 --> 01:04:01.670
Boss?

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:05.090
Boss! Come with me!

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:07.092
What's the matter?

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:12.264
Kanji's girl from last night has got
rather violent and uncontrollable.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.723
Not again?

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.268
Leave me alone!

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:19.646
That's dangerous!

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.110
Stop it!

01:04:27.738 --> 01:04:29.739
Someone stop her!

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:41.918
Mother!

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:46.298
What are you doing, both of you?
Stop it! Stop it!

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.552
Take that!

01:04:55.516 --> 01:04:57.100
Careful!

01:04:57.685 --> 01:05:01.062
I'm going to kill her!
Let me go!

01:05:02.773 --> 01:05:05.567
- Let me go!
- You nymphomaniac!

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:08.486
- Shut up!
- Calm down, please.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:10.655
Let me go, you old git!

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:13.783
Stop it!

01:05:14.785 --> 01:05:17.120
- Let me go!
- Fools!

01:05:20.499 --> 01:05:23.627
Kanji, what a tasteless scene
you've created.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:27.130
You call yourself an actor?

01:05:28.132 --> 01:05:29.174
Sorry.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:33.261
I'm not going to tell you
to stop these love affairs.

01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:38.475
That's all part of an actor's life.
One should keep lovers.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:42.145
But I don't want to see
vile scenes like this.

01:05:43.147 --> 01:05:45.690
Have you had enough, young lady?

01:05:45.816 --> 01:05:49.653
It's a tough world to get used to.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:53.657
- Go back to your village.
- I'm not leaving.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:57.452
- I want to join the troupe.
- No, no!

01:05:57.578 --> 01:06:00.330
She's like a mad dog.
Just send her away.

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:03.291
Deal with her yourself, you fool!

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.340
Just as I thought.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:14.594
You're a typical Kawachi girl
with balls of steel!

01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:20.809
I'll take you under my wing.
Just promise me you'll work hard.

01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:24.104
Thank you, Boss.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:28.525
Good. I'm asking you all
to look after her.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:32.153
And one more thing,
about Akasaka village,

01:06:32.279 --> 01:06:34.447
we're performing there
from tomorrow.

01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:36.282
Good luck for tonight.

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:37.951
That's great!

01:06:48.587 --> 01:06:50.630
Thank you.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:55.135
Hey, I want a word with you.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:58.680
- Good evening.
- Come on, don't be nervous.

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:03.476
I want a Coca-Cola, please, ma'am.

01:07:03.602 --> 01:07:06.104
- Two, please.
- I'll just get some more.

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.356
There's not much flavour in this.

01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:11.943
Surely not. I put loads of sugar
in it, just to please you.

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:13.445
Oh, really?

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.993
You're telling me that Misako is...?

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:22.954
She was overwhelmed.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.372
Misako...?

01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:25.999
What a nightmare.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:29.044
Don't worry, I've got an idea...

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:32.922
- Well?
- You can't!

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:37.135
- Swindling an actress for revenge...
- Lower your voice, you idiot!

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.688
Excuse me.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.702
- Pick one.
- Well, let me see...

01:08:02.828 --> 01:08:04.120
Just choose!

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:06.498
How about second from the right?

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:09.084
No, no! Second from the left.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.377
Her?

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:14.172
Nice big bum.

01:08:14.298 --> 01:08:16.132
She's just my type.

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:30.313
Oi, that's Misako!

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.150
That's her! Misako!

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:43.952
Keep it up, Misako!

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:46.371
She's not half bad.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:48.456
No, no!

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:49.999
Misako!

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:11.396
- Chidori...
- Kunida.

01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:16.442
I've been thinking
about what you said.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.903
Let's not talk about it.
I'm ashamed.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:20.738
No, please don't.

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:25.577
But I think it would be better
if you left.

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.122
Kunida...

01:09:30.374 --> 01:09:33.168
Please take Chigusa with you.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:37.005
That way, everyone will be happy.

01:09:39.925 --> 01:09:43.887
There's one thing
I really want to tell you.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:47.974
Meet me at the plum grove
after the show.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:50.518
Curtain!

01:09:50.644 --> 01:09:52.145
Curtain! Curtain!

01:09:54.481 --> 01:09:56.482
See you at the plum grove.

01:09:58.485 --> 01:10:00.069
Don't forget, Chidori!

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.458
- Ready?
- Yes.

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:36.981
Welcome, Eizaburo!

01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:38.816
- Casanova!
- Star!

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:40.860
You're so handsome!

01:10:40.986 --> 01:10:45.198
Eizaburo! Eizaburo!

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:50.453
Lady-killer!

01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:57.085
Concentrate!

01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:05.927
Smile for us!

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:09.430
- Cry for us!
- Look this way!

01:11:09.556 --> 01:11:11.057
Romeo!

01:11:11.183 --> 01:11:13.434
Gorgeous Eizaburo!

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.062
Eizaburo! You're gorgeous!

01:11:24.488 --> 01:11:26.948
- How's your neuralgia?
- Not so good.

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:29.033
I'll massage you later.

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:31.077
Thanks.

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:33.621
Are you there?

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:36.541
Here it comes!

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:40.878
How much longer?
I'm dying for a pee.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.172
Be patient, you idiot!

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.759
Here she comes.

01:11:59.064 --> 01:12:00.440
Shush!

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:13.536
Chigusa needs help!

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.163
What?

01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:30.094
Oi, you lot! Sing quietly.

01:12:34.808 --> 01:12:36.142
Which way?

01:12:38.228 --> 01:12:41.147
- That way.
- There!

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:48.696
- Across the water.
- It's too cold.

01:12:48.822 --> 01:12:53.659
- We can hide our tracks, though.
- I see. Let's do it, then.

01:13:05.672 --> 01:13:07.173
Ouch!

01:13:12.137 --> 01:13:13.846
Quick, out!

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.727
You fools! Idiots!

01:13:19.853 --> 01:13:21.562
Stop, that's dangerous!

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:23.689
- Don't!
- Stop!

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:26.317
You idiots!

01:13:28.278 --> 01:13:30.863
Chase after her!

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:33.282
Grab her!

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:50.591
Did you think
you could get away with this?

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:55.430
Take this as well!

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:58.266
Please, don't!

01:13:58.892 --> 01:14:01.269
Ouch! That hurt!

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.740
- Idiots!
- That's enough.

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:26.043
Chigusa!

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:29.297
Mr Kunida, sorry about the trouble.

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:32.425
Not at all. She needs rest.

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:38.264
Thanks, everybody.

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:41.100
- Let's go.
- Keep her warm.

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:42.643
Let's get back.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.692
I knew you'd come.

01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:16.529
Am I a wicked woman?

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:20.283
No, you're not.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:23.369
I love you. I wanted to tell you.

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:41.470
I'd better get back.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.265
I won't let you go.

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:47.310
- We have to stop.
- Chidori...

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:06.203
I am a wicked woman, after all.

01:17:08.206 --> 01:17:11.500
I didn't want
to make Chigusa unhappy,

01:17:12.544 --> 01:17:14.629
or make you suffer.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.173
But even so...

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:21.344
You poor woman.

01:17:26.266 --> 01:17:27.850
It's dawn.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.980
You'd never be able
to give up acting.

01:17:33.106 --> 01:17:34.649
Surely acting's your life.

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:38.486
I'd be sick or dead
if I wasn't an actor.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:42.198
I think I've fallen for you.

01:17:42.866 --> 01:17:45.493
You'd tire of me
after three months.

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:47.411
Tomihachiro...

01:17:54.878 --> 01:17:58.756
What are we going to do

01:17:58.882 --> 01:18:01.300
after last night?

01:18:01.426 --> 01:18:05.388
It's a new start.
We're going to be happy together.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:06.931
Yes, but...

01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:14.563
I have to go.

01:18:22.906 --> 01:18:24.073
Big sis!

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:29.370
Sis! You've been in the wrong bed!

01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:46.637
I'm sorry for what's happened
between us.

01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:58.107
What kind of person are you?

01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:05.030
You have no parents or siblings.

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:13.289
That's why you have
no understanding of love and hate.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:25.760
Big sister!

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:46.697
We need to talk,
not avoid each other.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:53.370
I'll tell you,
I really like Shinkichi.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:57.833
I respect him
as much as I love him.

01:19:58.543 --> 01:20:00.127
That's how it is.

01:20:00.253 --> 01:20:04.089
The fact he joined our theatre
group straight from university

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:06.467
is something worthy of respect.

01:20:11.598 --> 01:20:15.601
It doesn't matter
whether he's with you or me,

01:20:15.727 --> 01:20:18.646
but we need to keep him here.

01:20:19.689 --> 01:20:22.066
It's either with you or me.

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:24.235
I don't want to talk about it.

01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:26.070
No, we have to.

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:28.155
He might leave the company.

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:30.825
Did he say that?

01:20:33.286 --> 01:20:35.579
Yes, it's about time.

01:20:35.705 --> 01:20:38.332
Do you think I'd approve of that?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.334
That's why I'm begging you.

01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:43.462
Begging? We're far too busy.

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:47.299
But Chidori and I
are already involved.

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:50.177
What?

01:20:50.303 --> 01:20:53.389
I think she wants
to be with me too.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:56.475
- And what about Eizaburo?
- I've no idea what he thinks.

01:20:56.601 --> 01:20:58.102
- You spoke to him?
- Not yet.

01:20:58.228 --> 01:21:00.062
- Then it means nothing!
- But...

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:02.731
- You don't have the guts!
- I do!

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:29.925
Eizaburo...

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:46.520
That was superb. I'm impressed.

01:23:46.646 --> 01:23:50.232
Thanks. I love this play
more than anything.

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:54.194
- Which school is it?
- It's more or less my own style.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.321
But I put in lots of effort.

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.409
There's something else...

01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.454
...I want to discuss with you.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.248
Oi! I need a hand here!

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:10.544
Clear out, quickly!

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:14.548
Hurry up!
We don't have much time!

01:24:14.674 --> 01:24:17.259
Could you pay the bill now?

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:19.011
The workmen need to be paid.

01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:22.014
It can wait till later. I'm busy!

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:26.101
That dirty old man, Tomihachi,
he's with that woman.

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:28.187
Tell him to give us a hand here!

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:31.148
Shut up! I'm coming.

01:24:32.358 --> 01:24:35.027
And this is specially for you.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:36.987
Oh, eggs. Thanks.

01:24:37.113 --> 01:24:39.323
They're yours for 10 yen each.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:53.378
I have nothing to say.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:56.465
But I want to hear it from Chidori.

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.053
Are you leaving the company?

01:25:01.554 --> 01:25:03.931
- Or...
- Or what?

01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:05.182
Or...

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:10.646
Right, then...
I'll leave instead.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:14.316
- What are you saying?
- Yes, I'm leaving.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.195
Losing one is better than two.

01:25:18.321 --> 01:25:20.364
- No...
- Boss...

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:23.408
Thank you for having me
for so long.

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:27.830
I appreciate you've taught me
everything about the art from scratch.

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:33.544
I've been very happy
with the company.

01:25:34.587 --> 01:25:40.175
It's been heaven, living by the
stage from morning till night.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:45.180
I caused Chidori so many worries.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.349
And I apologise for that.

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:53.188
Chigusa!

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:57.651
Could you help the fella
with the costumes?

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:02.156
What are you all doing here?

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:04.116
Eizaburo's leaving.

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:05.576
What?

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:09.246
So what's going to happen?

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:16.211
Chidori, we should...

01:26:18.756 --> 01:26:20.382
Sorry.

01:26:23.219 --> 01:26:25.095
I'm so sorry, Mr Kunida.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:32.436
I can't leave him,
no matter what.

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:46.992
Right! That's fine, then. Good.

01:26:47.118 --> 01:26:48.577
We're leaving!

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:51.997
Let's go. Stand up. Go.

01:26:52.123 --> 01:26:53.498
Shall we?

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:55.334
Mr Kunida...

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.225
Can we settle the bill now?

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:13.518
God, you're persistent!
I said I would.

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:14.978
Go and pay him.

01:27:15.104 --> 01:27:17.064
I've no idea what's going on here.

01:27:22.153 --> 01:27:27.741
Mr Kunida, don't take this as
flattery, but I'm very fond of you.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:35.415
For a graduate, you're a good man.

01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:44.091
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:04.486
Chigusa!

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.451
Stop moping around here!

01:28:11.577 --> 01:28:14.246
You're letting
your husband Kunida escape.

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:20.210
Your big sister failed in the first
act. Go and open the second act.

01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:26.133
- You mean...
- He just left.

01:28:26.259 --> 01:28:29.303
Take your stuff with you.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.555
Go now.

01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:13.138
What's so funny?

01:29:13.264 --> 01:29:16.391
I didn't expect you
to be so sentimental,

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:20.103
seeing them off
with such a sullen face.

01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:21.605
I'm not sentimental.

01:29:21.731 --> 01:29:24.149
What's on your mind, then?

01:29:24.275 --> 01:29:26.276
It feels like I'm taking a detour.

01:29:28.237 --> 01:29:31.198
Really?
There's no such thing as a detour.

01:29:32.241 --> 01:29:34.993
If you think the detour
is a straight road,

01:29:35.119 --> 01:29:38.705
then the straight road
is actually a detour.

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:42.125
What did you say?

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:49.132
Even I'm confused now! Whatever!

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:53.220
Come on, let's go!

01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:56.390
- Where to?
- That's for you to decide.

01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:59.768
- Osaka or Tokyo or America!
- That's a bit reckless.

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:01.311
Let's get going!

01:30:03.314 --> 01:30:04.981
Adieu!

01:30:05.108 --> 01:30:08.110
- Right, let's go!
- Wait a moment...

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.324
- Are you all right?
- Forgive me.

01:30:15.201 --> 01:30:16.535
It's fine.

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.497
Let's get going!

01:30:20.623 --> 01:30:22.749
I'm so envious!

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:27.421
Everything won't be rosy,
but I'll give it a go.

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:30.340
- Take care!
- Good luck!

01:30:39.642 --> 01:30:41.768
Thanks for everything.

01:30:41.894 --> 01:30:43.395
You're welcome.

01:30:45.148 --> 01:30:46.898
Oi, wait!

01:31:19.765 --> 01:31:22.225
They're coming! They're coming!

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.271
Goodbye!

01:31:26.397 --> 01:31:29.816
Barnstorming troupe!
Beggars' theatre!

01:31:30.693 --> 01:31:32.944
We'll peep at you
bathing next time!

01:31:37.408 --> 01:31:41.411
- Visit us again!
- We'll be waiting!
