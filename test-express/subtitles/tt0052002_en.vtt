WEBVTT

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.196
Chick, chick, chick.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.148
Tobe, stop that doggone racket.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.631
<i>Quiet, Tobe.</i>

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.551
How far to Lordsburg?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.552
It's about ten miles that way.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.631
Thank you.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.597
Good afternoon, ma'am.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.351
Six sacks of grain.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.436
My horse limps. Take him
over to the smithy and tell him
I'll be along in a few minutes.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.317
Sure.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.880
- Yes, sir? What'll it be?
- I'd like a room.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.157
A room? We don't
get much hotel business...

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.549
around here
this time of the year.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.431
Sign right there.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.870
Planning to be around long?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.951
Not long.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.476
That'll be room number seven,
to the right at the top of the stairs.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.154
Oh, that's a buck and a half
in advance.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.075
I'll pay when I leave.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.077
Okay. Forget I mentioned it.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.479
We change sheets
on Friday, Mr. Grant.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.314
The name is Gant. John Gant.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.353
Did I hear right?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.069
- Did he say-
- He said "Gant."

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.994
Him? That kid?

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.038
That's him. Sid.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.078
<i>- Sid!</i>
- Yes, Mr. Reeger?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.914
- Go tell the sheriff.
- Yes, sir.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.396
Whoa, there, Sid.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.311
Somebody finally catch you
waterin' the whisky?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.356
- Can't stop, Earl. I gotta go!
- What's the rush?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.670
- It's Gant. John Gant. He's here!
- What do ya mean?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.320
He just rode up.
I gotta tell the sheriff.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.876
Gant, here?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.996
What's he want here?

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.914
Don't you know?
Same thing he wants anywhere.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.996
Fixed the lock. There wasn't
anything serious wrong with it.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.991
Buck! Oh. Buck!

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.548
- He's here. He's right here in town.
- You don't say.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.838
- Who's that, Sid?
- Gant! John Gant.
He just took a room at the hotel.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.434
- He just get in?
- Just this minute.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.876
- Well.
- "Well"? Is that all?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.190
- You want me to cheer?
- Who's John Gant, Buck?

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.192
Well, you've got to do something
about it! Mr. Reeger said-

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.114
I don't care what Mr. Reeger said!
There's nothing I can do.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.556
- Well, if you can't, who can?
- Who's he talkin' about?

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.835
- You mean you really don't know?
- I asked, didn't I?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.832
- He's a killer.
- So what? We've had
some pretty good ones.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.070
- We've been able to handle them.
- No, no.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.118
A gunman is one thing.
Gant's another.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.760
Why, he's killed 20 or 30 men.
For money!

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.718
He just goes into a town and kills 'em!
Like that.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.837
- He's a- Well, an assassin.
- How come he's still loose?

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.639
He prods them into it.
You know as well as I do.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.632
You can make any man fight
if you try hard enough.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.551
He makes them draw first...

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.200
then he kills them
in front of witnesses.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.840
Sid, did he say how long
he was gonna stay?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.195
No, he- he didn't say nothin'.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.477
Buck, who do you suppose
he's after?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.711
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe he isn't after anyone at all.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.316
Mmm. He took a room.
He's not just passing through.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.356
Yeah. Well, it could be anyone.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.874
Anyone that has an enemy
that hates him enough.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.791
Why don't <i>you</i> tell me
who he's after?

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.394
- What are you gonna do? Pick him up?
- On what charge?

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.869
Because he makes
Henry Reeger nervous?

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.791
Let me tell ya.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.758
You watch some of our
respected citizens from now on.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.910
You're gonna learn something.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.309
And I'll tell you something else.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.551
I've been a lawman here
for a good many years.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.235
I can think of quite a few people
that'd like to see <i>me</i> dead.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.754
Everybody steps
on somebody else's toes sometime.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.990
You're the boss,
but if he's as bad as you say...

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.911
it's not gonna be nice
havin' him around.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.991
I know it.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.469
But we'll just have to
wait him out.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.348
If I can pick him up
or run him out of town, I will.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.911
If I can. But I can't do it
without an excuse.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.116
We just have to wait
him out, that's all.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.351
You gonna play or aren't ya?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.877
Hello, Dutch.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.553
"Dutch"? Who's Dutch?

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.235
- I don't know.
- Well, aren't you a Dutchman?

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.788
What's that got to do with it?
He wasn't talking to me.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.030
What are you worried about, then?

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.190
What do you think?
He makes me nervous!

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.874
Well, you're not the only one.
That's all for me.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.713
- Well, are we playin' or ain't we?
- Without me.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.756
Me too.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.197
Think he's after you, Henry?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.111
What would he want with me?

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.998
I wouldn't know.
Thought maybe you would.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.275
Could be after anyone.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.716
What are you pushing me for, Ben?
Maybe he's after you.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.669
Maybe you're right, Dutch.
Maybe he is.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.590
Howdy. I'll be right with ya.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.555
There. That your horse?

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.438
- That's right.
- That's a beautiful animal, well cared for.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.796
You can tell a lot about a man
by examining his horse.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.030
- I'm Luke Canfield.
<i>- Doc! Doc!</i>

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.430
You know who
just came into town, big as... life?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.674
I-I'm sorry, Doc.
I-I didn't know you was busy!

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.558
- That's all right, Sid. Who came into town?
- Well-

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.551
Never mind.
I-It ain't important.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.278
- My horse all right?
- He's fine. Just needed a shoe.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.148
- You can take him now, Mister- Uh-
- Gant. He called you "Doc."

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.356
- That's right.
<i>- Hey, Luke! Gimme a hand.</i>

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.318
- All right.
- Clear that stump for me.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.231
My father, Asa, Mr. Gant.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.871
<i>- He's the blacksmith. I'm just a helper.</i>
- Your name's Gant?

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.037
That's right. John Gant.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.117
Howdy, Mr. Gant.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.111
- Your son's a doctor?
- That's right.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.555
I'm what passes for one
here in Lordsburg.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.189
Don't let him fool you, Mr. Gant.
He's the best in the Southwest.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.510
<i>That boy, he'll fix you</i>
<i>if you're ailin'.</i>

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.353
Or if your horse is ailin'.
I'm also the vet.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.715
- You stayin' here in town?
- The Soledad.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.315
I'm goin' that way. I'll walk with you,
sort of show you around.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.191
- Have to rebuild that wall every year.
- Nothin' like workin'
in a smith's, Mr. Gant...

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.271
to keep your body in trim.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.396
Dad is a perfect example.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.392
- You comin' home?
- No, I'll clean up first.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.836
Mr. Gant, I'll take your horse
over to the stable.
They'll take good care of it.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.718
- That'll be fine.
- Are you ready?

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.273
It's a nice town-
small enough to be comfortable,
but large enough to have a future.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.839
You seem to like it here.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.912
A town worth livin' in
is a town worth bein' proud of.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.276
Luke the Physician.
You were well named.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.239
That's my father's idea.
He made up his mind I'd be
a doctor before I was born.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.675
I never had a chance.
What's your line, Mr. Gant?

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.718
<i>- Hi, Doc.</i>
- You might say we're in related fields.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.950
I cure things too.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.315
A smithy's an unusual place
to find a physician.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.712
I've got an office over the bank,
but it's pretty hard
to get a sick horse up those stairs!

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.998
Well, you old mummy.
There you go, sleepin' again. Wake up!

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.719
I wasn't sleepin'.
I was thinkin'.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.109
Well, then do it
with your eyes open.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.077
You been 20 minutes!

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.710
Hey, Luke!
You got time for a game?

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.677
This old coot can't stay awake.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.638
Wish I had, Charlie.
I can't now.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.788
- Do you play chess?
- Oh, I play at it.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.791
Well, I'd like to play you
a game, Physician.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.111
- You'd make a good opponent.
- You gonna be in town
for a while? Why not?

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.919
- I'll be here for a while.
- We've got a date.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.391
Did you lose something, Anne?

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.114
Luke Canfield,
since I was here last week...

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.475
how could a house get so messy?

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.074
It's a wonder you don't
tether your horse on that table.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.233
- What's the matter with the table?
- If you don't know, it's not
gonna do any good to tell you.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.151
- Where's your father?
- He'll be along.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.151
So we've got to hurry.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.796
- What's for supper?
- Oh, you're going to be
a romantic husband.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.156
I've had a hard day
with one dyspeptic old woman...

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.710
one small boy's stomach-ache,
a gashed foot and a limping horse.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.712
- That makes a man hungry.
- I hope Asa hurries. The roast is ready.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.429
He wouldn't miss a Tuesday
night supper for anything.
That makes his whole week.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.593
- How's your father?
- Oh, he had another bad night.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.955
He seems to be better
during the day.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.838
Sometimes the climate here
does remarkable things for consumption.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.751
Sometimes.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.150
I'm doing everything I can,
everything I know how to do.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.118
I wish I knew more,
but I don't.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.029
Let's take a look at the roast.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.712
You ought to be as fat as a bull,
the way you keep shoveling it in.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.031
After a week of what <i>you</i> do to food,
this is heaven.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.669
- Why is it everything you cook
tastes like a prescription?
- What makes you think it isn't?

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.719
I suspicioned it. You better watch him
after you get married.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.873
- He'll slip cod liver oil in the soup.
- Cod liver oil is good for you.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.076
I'll get it.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.431
- Good evening, Doc.
- Oh, come in, Sheriff.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.829
- Oh, you're just havin' supper?
<i>- We just finished.</i>

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.559
- Hi, Asa. Hello, Anne.
- Evening, Sheriff.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.790
What's on your mind, Sheriff?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.236
- You talked with John Gant today.
- That's right.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.357
- You know who he is?
- Uh, he's John Gant, I guess.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.637
- I know.
- Am I supposed to
know something I don't?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.598
That's right. You spent a lot of time
back East in school.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.875
All right. Who is he?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.076
He's a killer, Doc.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.232
- Didn't act like one. Cup of coffee, Buck?
- Yeah, please.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.118
He's a hired assassin.
He was sent here to kill somebody.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.839
- That's his job.
- You sound mighty positive.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.751
You know
the man's reputation, Asa.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.638
Sure, but that's all I know.
I don't know the man.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.551
Well, in this case
the reputation <i>is</i> the man.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.359
- I doubt that, Buck.
- What makes you so sure?

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.069
Because he always works the same way.
He comes into a town, checks into a hotel.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.038
Sticks around a few days,
sizing up the situation.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.591
Then he picks a fight with his man.
He's never lost yet.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.673
Just hearsay, Buck.
You can't condemn a man
on what you hear about him.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.435
No, Asa. It's common knowledge.
Every lawman knows about him.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.080
I got a stack of reports
from other states on him.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.948
I'll admit I've never seen him,
but... I'm convinced.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.919
You sound awfully sure he's after
somebody here. Who do you think it is?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.117
- I thought maybe you could tell me.
- What makes you think I can?

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.191
You talked to him.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.432
Maybe he dropped a hint.
Did he mention any names,
ask about anyone?

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.876
- No. We talked about chess.
- Chess?

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.076
Yeah. We're gonna play a game.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.915
Yeah, that figures, all right.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.549
Someday, Doc, you're gonna start living
in the same world with the rest of us.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.792
Half of this town is scared
that Gant's gonna kill 'em,
and you're gonna play chess with him.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.552
Why shouldn't he, Buck?

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.710
Until we know better,
Gant's just another man.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.236
Even if he's what you say,
he's not after Luke or me.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.151
Maybe.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.152
It's a rare man that hasn't
made an enemy sometime in his life.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.836
A man's guilt's his own burden, Buck,
and you can't do anything about it.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.831
I might have to.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.390
Doc...

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.153
if Gant stays here,
somebody's gonna die.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.518
Now, that might be
the least that could happen.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.592
Well, you go ahead
and play chess with him.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.511
Maybe you'll learn something.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.398
Assuming what you say is true,
why don't you move against him now?

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.268
I can't. I've got to have a legal reason.
Gant isn't a wanted man.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.590
Anyhow, I-

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.911
I'm not sure I could stop him,
even if I had a reason.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.514
Don't let yourself
get stampeded, Buck.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.910
I'm sure everything can be worked out
peacefully if you really want it that way.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.036
It takes two to make peace.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.669
Gant's like a disease that
they haven't found a cure for.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.234
Except for this.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.198
He's supposed to be better
with this kind of medicine than anyone.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.153
- Goodnight, Doc.
- Goodnight, Sheriff.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.311
Gant. John Gant?

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.551
- Yeah. Do you know him, Judge?
- Well, I know of him.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.517
So he's here.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.353
- What's the matter, Judge?
- Huh? Nothing.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.273
I guess I should have taken
your advice and gone to bed.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.316
I'm a little tired.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.198
Now you're being smart.
Take your medicine and get some sleep.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.157
No. No more medicine.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.118
You've gotta take it, Judge.
You may as well face facts.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.988
This medicine is-
Well, you're still alive.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.514
Yes, I'm still alive.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.353
But does it really matter
how a man dies, or when...

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.079
when he knows
it's gonna happen?

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.397
You see that he takes it.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.638
Gant ain't done a thing, Ben.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.555
Last night he sat over there
drinking coffee until late.
Didn't talk to anybody at all.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.951
Yes, Mr. Gant?

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.917
Give me some silver
for this, will ya?

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.870
- I'd like some coffee.
- Right, Mr. Gant.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.352
There.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.232
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure!

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.311
I just saw them
talking together.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.078
I told you we shouldn't
have tried to force Chaffee out, Earl!

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.196
He found the mine.
We only financed it.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.555
Stop sniveling.
It's a perfectly sound business deal.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.872
- Chaffee doesn't think it's just business.
- He'd do the same thing to us.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.791
So that's why he hired Gant.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.838
He wants sole ownership
of the mine. Use your head!

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.115
If he gets rid of us,
he's got it all!

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.909
- What are we gonna do?
- How do I know?

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.679
- I should never have listened
to you in the first place.
- Oh, shut up.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.591
The money isn't worth it!

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.796
Money?

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.711
That might do it.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.519
Money brought Gant here.
Maybe it can get him to leave.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.471
Come on.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.391
- Where to?
- To see Gant.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.914
- Why do I have to go?
- You wanna stay alive, don't you?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.911
This is your only chance!

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.675
Yes, Mr. Gant?

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.073
- Some more coffee.
- I'll have to make some fresh.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.958
- Then make it.
- Yes, sir. I'll be right back.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.675
Mr. Gant?

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.789
I'm Earl Stricker.
This is Thad Pierce.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.156
- We've come to talk to you.
- Talk.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.151
Well, can we, uh-

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.954
<i>All right if we sit down?</i>

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.235
We know why you're here.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.197
You do?

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.910
I'll, uh, get right to it, Mr. Gant.
We wanna make a deal.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.991
You don't say.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.230
What kind of a deal?

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.437
Whatever you were paid to come here,
we'll- we'll double it...

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.351
if you'll leave right now.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.476
Why?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.551
<i>I-Isn't it obvious?</i>

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.553
<i>Yes. It's obvious.</i>

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.995
If it isn't enough...

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.117
you can name your own price.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.839
<i>- Do you run a business?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.309
- A couple of 'em.
- I own the bank.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.950
You heard I'm for sale,
and you think I can be bought off.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.474
What makes you think
I'd be interested in you?

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.791
No! We didn't say we thought
anything of the kind!

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.151
That's right. You didn't.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.993
You're just doing this as a favor
to the rest of the town.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.516
- We can add two and two together.
<i>- Congratulations, banker.</i>

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.636
No deal.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.995
You're making a mistake.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.957
You'll never know, banker...

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.508
unless I have come for you.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.116
- How about that coffee?
<i>- Yes, sir. Comin' right up, Mr. Gant.</i>

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.192
- Thad! Thad!
- I knew it wouldn't do any good!

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.590
- We've got to figure some other way.
- There is no other way!

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.511
Thad!

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.114
- Mr. Pierce, I-
- Shut up!

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.239
I don't want to see anyone.
Understand? Anyone!

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.431
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.960
- Afternoon, Doc.
- Hello, Ben.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.156
- How's your boy?
- Seems much better today.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.879
- How'd that new vein pan out?
- Oh, vein's fine.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.111
It's not the vein that's worryin' me.
Anything happen in town?

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.270
- Such as?
- Gant.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.590
No. Think something's
going to happen?

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.671
Don't you?

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.637
Milly's inside.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.950
Ben, I just saw Stricker and Pierce.
They were talkin' with John Gant!

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.235
- Where?
- In the Soledad. They were real chummy.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.595
Look, I think Charley's
down in the shaft. Go get him.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.671
We've got some talkin' to do.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.070
He's doing fine, Mrs. Chaffee.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.073
This little Indian'll be out
catching lizards in a couple of days
if you keep him in bed.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.435
- But I hate it in bed!
- Oh?

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.239
You wait till you grow up.
You'll change your tune.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.118
Just keep forcing these down his throat.
He's about back to normal.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.192
I know by tomorrow
I'll have to strap him in bed.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.478
- All right, young man.
- Ma, I hate those awful big pills.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.791
No need my coming here again.
Bring him in the office
next time you're in town.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.792
Thank you, Doctor.
Come on, honey. Sit up.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.832
We can't stand still for it.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.673
If they get me out of the way,
you don't think you'll be safe!

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.320
There's one thing to do:
Beat Gant to the punch.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.231
- Looks that way.
- Hiya, Doc.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.595
- Hello, Hugo. Charley.
- How's the boy?

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.671
He's gonna be fine.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.911
Doc, when you were talkin'
with Gant yesterday...

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.831
did he tell you anything?

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.196
Buck Hastings asked me the same thing.
Gant isn't very talkative.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.670
Earl Stricker and Thad Pierce
hired Gant... to kill me.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.878
- I doubt that, Ben.
- Yeah? Then how come they were
meetin' with him this morning?

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.078
- Hugo saw them.
<i>- I</i> was talking with Gant yesterday,
and <i>I</i> certainly didn't bring him here.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.232
That's different. Stricker and Pierce
have every reason for wantin' me dead.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.151
Everybody knows it.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.071
Now, I ain't a troublemaker...

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.630
but I'm not standin' by and do nothin'
with Gant fixin' to kill me.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.793
Ben, I wouldn't do anything rash.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.553
Why don't you leave it up to
Buck Hastings? He's a good man.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.473
Sure, he is. But I don't
think he can handle Gant.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.917
- I don't think anybody can.
- There isn't much sense in trying
anything on your own, is there?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.710
Well, maybe I can't handle Gant,
but Stricker and Pierce
are somethin' else again.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.112
- What do you mean?
- We're not lettin' those crooks
take over the mine.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.873
And you can tell Stricker I said so!

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.191
That ain't just talk, Luke.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.191
Come on.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.275
You're lyin'. You're a-lyin'
just as sure as you're sittin' there.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.318
- You're lyin' in your teeth.
- What teeth?

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.757
- Well, you're lyin', anyhow.
- Why, I see'd it myself,
right outside of Veracruz.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.469
Just one teeny little shot,
and the Eighth Illinois "et" dirt.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.916
There you go, lyin' again.
Ed, you're just a natural born liar.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.278
- It's a habit with you.
- Oh, I got you now.
You can't prove a thing!

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.432
Why, you simple-minded,
flea-bitten old coot!

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.990
If you weren't so old, I'd- I'd-

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.836
Hey, sonny. Would you mind
movin' aside a little bit?

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.751
You're cuttin' out the sun.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.238
Now, let's see.
What was we talkin' about?

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.790
Well, by George, I forget.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.997
So do I, but whatever it was,
you was lyin' about it.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.640
Come on. Let's go
pitch some horseshoes.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.991
Dad, what do you do when you
run up against a disease that
you're not equipped to cure?

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.150
What are you gettin' at?

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.708
I went out to
Chaffee's mine today.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.475
I think Ben is gonna try and kill
Earl Stricker and Thad Pierce.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.358
He thinks they hired Gant
to kill him.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.749
Buck Hastings is scared.
I know he is.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.308
I hear that Thad Pierce
has locked himself in his office.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.836
And Henry Reeger is wearin' a gun.
It's the first time I ever saw him with one.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.911
Everybody you talk to is jumpy.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.037
What causes a thing like that?
The whole town is comin' apart.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.193
I shouldn't have to tell you
what fear does to people.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.713
Fear, that's one thing.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.236
A man's a fool not to be careful
around a rabid dog or a wolf...

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.392
but he's more foolish
if he panics.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.074
Well, it's gotta stop.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.549
Only I don't know exactly
what it is that has to stop.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.074
Let it develop. Wait and see.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.390
I wouldn't let a cold develop
into pneumonia if I could help it.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.439
Why not? You can't cure a cold,
but sometimes you can cure pneumonia.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.511
You'd make a fine doctor.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.511
Where you goin'?

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.030
Gonna play a game of chess.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.433
Look at him.
The way he just sits there.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.557
- Who does he think he is?
- Shut up, Lou.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.598
I'll shut up when I'm ready.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.833
I've about had it.
I'm tired of running!

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.388
I told you Sam would catch up
with us someday.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.755
Then why didn't
he come himself?

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.912
I'll tell you why.
Because I'd kill him, and he knew it!

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.675
Sure, you would.
He was just scared to death of you!

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.558
He was a hundred times
the man you are.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.154
Yeah? If you think so much of him,
why'd you leave him?

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.994
I wish I knew.
I-I keep wondering.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.991
You keep wondering!

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.918
That stupid sawbones!

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.911
What's the matter with him?

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.438
I'm not gonna just sit back
and wait. That's for sure.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.351
Lou Fraden don't eat crow.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.989
No, Lou Fraden just runs
and runs and runs-

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.514
You think I'm afraid to go out there
and call him down, don't you?

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.309
Just because I've been clerkin'
for Stricker, you think
I forgot how to be a man?

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.231
You never knew how
to begin with.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.118
Anyway, Gant doesn't want you.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.031
Yeah? I know better.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:29.194
No. Sam wouldn't dirty his hands
with you or me, either one.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.511
Lou, you're not
even worth killing.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.838
Go ahead, Lou. Be brave.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.751
Go on.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.311
Hmm.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.269
Mr. Gant, why have you
come to Lordsburg?

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.670
Physician, I didn't ask you how
many tonsils you removed today.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.671
Well, you're welcome to.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.432
It doesn't interest me.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.988
You've been here
less than 24 hours.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.789
- Do you realize what your
coming here has done to this town?
- I've done nothing.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.678
But you've got to admit
that as the only doctor in town...

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.389
I have a certain interest in what we
might call "the municipal state of health."

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.119
Did it ever occur to you that
you might be wasting your life?

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.316
I'm not wasting my life.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.428
They're gonna die anyway.
Best you can do is drag out
their miserable lives. Why bother?

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.512
Death is inevitable
for all of us, Gant.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.558
But we all try to put it off
for as long as possible.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.909
It's occurred to me that the real
sicknesses, the most important ones...

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.752
are seldom physical.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.718
I think I've had more experience
with those than you have.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.439
Well, you sound more
like a preacher than-

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.711
Than a killer, Physician?

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.109
I don't know.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.071
You think you've got a mission?

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.674
Yes. I try to keep people alive.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.951
I've got a mission too.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.389
I don't suppose you know why
he's locked himself in his office all day.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.755
He's afraid of me.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.718
Should he be?

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.839
I know nothing about the man,
except that he's a coward and a thief.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.717
That's ridiculous.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.633
Thad Pierce has done
a lot for this town.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.950
Who'd he steal from?

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.030
I don't know...

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.070
but he is a thief.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.833
Hmm. You play
a very interesting game.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.992
I think you'd better get over
to the bank, Physician.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.916
It's Mr. Pierce. He shot himself.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.430
Wilson, what's goin' on in there?

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:23.036
It's awful, Mr. Stricker. The doc's
tryin' to keep him alive, but... his head.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.308
It was because of Gant, wasn't it?

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.631
- What makes you think that?
- Couldn't be anything else.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.109
He thought Gant was after him.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.078
Poor Thad.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.234
Doesn't make any difference.
No matter who Gant came after,
we gotta do something about it.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.516
I can't feel his pulse any more.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.837
He's dead. I couldn't stop it.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.071
It's a miracle you kept him alive
as long as you did, Doc.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.749
How can they do it?

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.150
How can they throw
this thing away?

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.994
The whole world struggles to live,
and some men kill themselves.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.671
Or did he?

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.512
You were expecting it
to happen, weren't you?

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.036
- I wasn't surprised.
- You killed him.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.951
You're wrong, Physician.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.157
He started killing himself
long before I ever got here.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.800
You've got it all figured out,
haven't ya?

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.598
You look at Gant,
and you say he's a murderer.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.558
- Well?
- I've killed.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.830
But the important point is,
who have I killed?

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.559
It doesn't make any difference.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.676
My price is high.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.469
The man who hires me
makes a considerable investment.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.109
The death of a man without guilt is
seldom worth that much money to anyone.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.071
You don't understand me,
do you, Physician?

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.596
Are you trying to tell me
that the men you've killed deserved to die?

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.594
Let's say, uh, most of them.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.996
Even if I admit that there are men who
have done things deserving punishment...

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.674
I wouldn't grant you
or anyone else the right to punish them!

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.671
That's up to the law.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.111
Take two men.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.998
Say they have robbed and lied
and have never paid.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.878
A man whom one of them has robbed
comes to me and says...

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.269
"Kill that man
who has robbed me."

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.191
And I kill him.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.078
The other man becomes ill and would die,
except for a physician...

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.438
who returns him to health-
to rob and lie again.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.750
Who's the villain in this piece?

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.831
Me or the physician?

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.794
Don't look as though
you think I'm insane.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.711
You think about it.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.149
Stop tellin' me what you want me to do,
and tell me how to do it!

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.071
Now, what am I gonna
charge Gant with?

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.596
You know as well as all of us.
He's responsible for Thad killing himself.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.069
And you're worried
he'll be coming after you next.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.870
- We're not asking you to jail him.
Just get him out of town.
- Oh, sure, Henry, sure.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.758
I'll tell him you haven't been
sleeping nights. That oughta do it.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.671
He's got a cute answer
for everything.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.671
Buck, we're through arguing.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.558
It's up to you and your deputy
to handle this situation...

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.279
and if you can't do it, we've been
paying the wrong men long enough.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.828
Don't tempt me
to turn in my badge, Earl.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.230
That idea's been running through my mind.
I'm not a bit proud of it.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.199
- Hal, it looks like
you're elected along with me.
- Whatever you say.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.397
- Let's go see how we make out.
- Buck.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.349
Whatever you have to do,
I'll see that the town council
backs you up and makes it official.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.795
- Can I depend on that?
- Yeah.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.030
Well, that gives me an idea. Thanks.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.476
<i>Mr. Gant, I'm Sheriff Hastings.</i>

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.438
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave town.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.231
Why should I leave?

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.710
We've just put a law on the books
against a public nuisance.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.711
Mr. Gant, you're a public nuisance.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.431
Go away.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.156
If you won't leave of your own accord,
then I'm gonna have to-

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.071
Why didn't you kill me?

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.310
I wasn't paid to.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.356
Let's put this on.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.791
All right.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.791
There you are, Buck.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.838
- You'll be as sound as
a dollar in a few weeks.
- Sure.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.117
Even now it won't interfere
with your work, if you're careful.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.317
Oh, I'm always careful.
Didn't you know that?

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.269
Well, Luke, what do we do now?

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.316
We don't even have any law.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.868
Of course we do.
What's a bad arm to you?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.033
Oh, no, it isn't the arm.
It's what it stands for.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.350
Word gets around, you know?

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.117
- I understand, Hal.
- Buck, I'm sorry.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.590
It's all right, son.
I don't blame you at all. I'll take it.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.717
Buck's twice the gun I am.
I'm not gonna get myself killed!

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.277
I sure wish I could
hand my badge in that easily.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.078
No, you don't, Buck.
We couldn't do without you.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.516
No, Luke, I'm no good.
I can't help you.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.795
The law can go only so far.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.429
But you know, in a way I ought to
be kind of glad about this.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.397
It means he didn't
come here for me.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.313
- Maybe he didn't come here for anyone.
- Maybe not.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.039
- Men are startin' to die anyway.
- I know it.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.079
He could be as innocent as a baby,
but the things that are happening
are still his fault.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.596
You're right.
Well, it's out of my field, anyhow.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.955
It's more your kind
of a problem than mine.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.635
The most useless man in town right now
is a man that's good with a gun.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.553
I can't tell you
or anyone else what to do.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.677
All I can tell you
is that my way isn't good enough.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.513
If we're gonna get rid of Gant
and stop these killings...

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.319
we've just got to find
some other way, that's all.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.836
Oh, uh, thanks
for patching me up, Doc.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.438
It's too bad about Buck.
He's a good sheriff.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.431
We'll never find
another one like him.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.829
But I wouldn't blame him
if he resigned.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.911
And now you want
to know what to do.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.230
With Buck helpless,
we've got to do something.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.231
Because if we don't-

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.914
Well, I've told you
the way things are in town.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.788
I'm getting tired of coughing.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.672
I'm sorry, Judge. I wish there
was something else I could do.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.955
You've done all you can.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.793
Luke, I haven't sat
on the bench in ten years.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.793
The laws on the books may have changed,
but the law itself hasn't.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.757
Law is the manifest will
of the people...

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.354
the conscious rule
of the community.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.877
And when the mechanics of
law enforcement break down,
they must be re-established.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.236
- Nobody would take Buck's job now.
<i>- Of course not.</i>

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.390
<i>So it's up to</i>
<i>the citizens as a whole.</i>

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.631
- You mean vigilantes, Dad?
- That's mob rule. I don't like it.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.838
It doesn't have to be.
It usually winds up that way.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.718
Well, here's an alternative, I suppose.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.631
What?

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.554
Make it easy for Gant to finish
what he came here for. He'd leave then.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.915
That's ridiculous.
He came here to kill.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.039
It would be one man's life against the life
of the town. Wouldn't it be worth it?

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.759
Of course it wouldn't.
You're not serious.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.949
What sort of a man is Gant?

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.235
I don't really know. Why?

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.073
Just curiosity.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.958
I don't like that vigilante idea.
There's gotta be another way.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.112
Well, if you find one,
let me know.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.555
Luke, how-

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.950
- How long did you say I've got left?
- Dad!

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.156
I don't think
we ought to talk about it.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.676
Let's be adult, Luke.
Anne knows all about it.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.671
Well, anything can happen.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.469
- It was about six months, wasn't it?
- Maybe, if you're careful.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.358
You're not thinking
of doing anything foolish?

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.512
I quit doing foolish things long ago.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.037
Judge, I'm sorry I worried you with this.
You forget about it.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.588
It's a hard thing to forget.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.274
I like this town.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.715
Luke, I'm glad about you and Anne.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.631
So am I, Judge.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.757
You try those new compounds
and try and get some sleep, huh?

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.751
I'll wake you for dinner.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.598
All right,
what's on your mind, Henry?

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.797
I'm fed up with this guessing game
of who Gant's after.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.031
Now that Hastings has bungled the job,
we've got to do something.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.633
Got any ideas?

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.917
Some of your drivers are good men.
I've got a few friends.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.958
We get everybody together,
Gant won't stand a chance.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.349
Maybe, if everybody goes with us.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.432
Mr. Reeger, you'd better come back.
Lou Fraden's getting himself
liquored up for trouble.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.638
He says Gant's here after him,
and he's getting drunk enough
to try to take him on.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.518
You go on back, Sid.
We'll be over in a minute.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.149
There's a good chance
that Lou may be right.
I don't know much about him.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.437
- Maybe Gant did come after him.
- Who'd pay good money
to have him killed?

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.637
I said it was a small chance,
buy why interfere?

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.915
Suppose he does go against Gant.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.355
He just might get lucky.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.073
Lou. Lou, I want to talk to you.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.433
Gant!

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.829
I'm through running.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.309
I've taken all I'm gonna.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.120
Sam Ellis never was a man.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.668
He wasn't man enough
to keep his own wife!

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.752
Now he ain't man enough to do
his own killin'. He's gotta send you!

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.956
You'd better go away, little friend.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.272
<i>Sendin' a vulture like you</i>
<i>won't get him back. You tell him that!</i>

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.831
No, you can't tell him that.
You'll be dead.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.196
- Lou, don't be a fool.
- Shut up, Doc!

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.671
If nobody else is man enough
to stop this murderer, I'll do it.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.558
Why do you want
to kill me, friend?

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.359
You know why.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.511
All right.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.797
If you think you can do it,
go ahead and try.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.269
Look at my hands.
They're on the table.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.952
<i>You could beat me to the draw.</i>

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.395
<i>I couldn't possibly outdraw you.</i>

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.638
So go ahead and shoot.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.989
I'll shoot.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.991
You think I'm yellow.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.593
Be a shame to waste
all that whisky.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.316
Go ahead. I thought
you wanted to kill me.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.475
You want me to.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.551
You want me to draw.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.911
Oh, no.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.270
Oh, no, you don't.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.273
You want a chance at me.
You want to kill me!

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.911
Everybody, look. You see?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.754
I didn't go for my gun!
He's got no excuse!

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.910
He can't kill me now!

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.631
Physician.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.996
I'm sorry about your sheriff.
He had courage.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.150
What you did wasn't necessary.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.038
I wouldn't have done it
if it hadn't been.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.634
<i>You're brewin' big trouble</i>
<i>for yourself.</i>

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.314
Who from? Men like him?

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.231
Gant, I'm a healer.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.756
I've devoted my life to it,
and I intend to continue.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.550
Right now I've got one big public
health problem, and I'm looking at it.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:45.277
I like you, Physician.
You're like me.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.477
You and I may well be
the only two honest men in town.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.678
Don't compare us.
We've got nothing in common.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.676
Everybody dies.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.920
I didn't hear any shots.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.514
Start packing.
We're leaving town.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.638
Sam must hate us
even more than I thought.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.029
He's gonna
let us stay together.

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.519
Well, cheer up, Lou.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.195
After all,
we got what we wanted:

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.350
each other.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.030
<i>- I kinda wish it was official-like.</i>
<i>- Who's gonna make it official?</i>

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.270
<i>You want Hastings to help?</i>
<i>He's already tried.</i>

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.635
<i>Maybe you want old Judge Benson</i>
<i>to give you his blessing?</i>

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.029
- Well?
- Gant's still sitting on the porch.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.190
I ran into Asa,
and he's going after Luke.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.794
Wants us to wait
until they get here.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.075
We're not waiting for anybody.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.152
We all know why we're here,
and we know what we've gotta do.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.151
I'd feel better with
Luke and Asa with us.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.674
There are enough of us
to handle Gant without them.

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.877
- He's only one man.
<i>- That's right.</i>

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.110
He's only one man.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.391
What are you doing here, Hastings?

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.550
Trying to keep you
from being a pack of fools.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.677
You keep out of it, Buck.
We'll handle it our own way.

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.469
With guns? I can tell you all you need to
know about goin' against him with a gun.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.994
- I think there's enough of us.
- I doubt it.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.798
Buck, you got eyes.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.792
You can't expect this town
to just sit back and let him have his way.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.599
The town?

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.592
Well, just what has the town
got to do with it?

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.989
Some of you people have
been sold a bill of goods.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.878
Earl isn't worried about the town,
he's worried about his own skin.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.315
- Just take it easy.
- And Reeger!

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.198
He has his own reasons for bein' worried.
Ask him about 'em.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.477
If we let Gant go on,
we won't have any town to live in!

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.233
Buck, maybe you're right,
but it don't cut ice.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.233
You can't do anything about it,
and it's up to the rest of us.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.118
I don't like it much,
but what else can we do?

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.839
All right. We've talked enough.
Let's go.

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.992
Oh, listen to me!
A mob isn't the answer!

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.598
You couldn't wait, Earl.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.478
- You're determined
to get somebody killed.
- Only Gant.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.358
We're gonna tell him either he gets on
his horse right now and gets out of town...

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.271
or we're gonna gun him down.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.191
Who's gonna do the talkin'?
You, Earl?

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.350
Why not? You think
you can do any better?

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.034
Well, maybe I can.
At least I can try.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.032
- Asa will go with me.
The rest of you wait here.
- No.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.591
We're stayin' right behind you.
He'll listen better lookin' down
the muzzles of a dozen guns.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.319
There's time for that later,
if we have to.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.359
- Give me a chance to try and
work it out without bloodshed.
- You'll have your chance.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.635
You can do all the talkin'
you want to.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.314
But when you fall flat on your face,
then we're gonna do it my way.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.198
It's either that, or you can
stay out of it altogether.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.316
Gant won't dare
go against all of us.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.994
You're goin' with us?

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.991
- All right.
- Come on.

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.991
Gant?

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.790
You're an organizer
as well as a physician.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.156
I've come to ask you to leave.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.071
And you come alone
and unafraid.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.119
We're not gonna argue with you, Mr. Gant.
We ask you to leave quietly.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.071
And if I don't?

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.675
I'm tryin' to stop violence, Gant,
not cause it.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.558
I ask you to consider what
will happen if you refuse.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.391
I've thought of it.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.198
Ask him who he's after, Doc.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.714
It doesn't make any difference
who he's after.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.711
<i>We're not gonna sacrifice anyone.</i>

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.351
All right, Doc, you've talked enough.
Now we'll do it our way.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.351
There are many of you!

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.115
Yes, you could kill me,
if you're willing enough.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.239
But it's only fair to tell you first
that I'll kill you, Stricker...

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.428
and you, Dutch Henry...

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.876
the physician, his father...

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.194
and there might even be
time for you, storekeeper.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.279
You surprise me, Physician.

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:55.148
<i>I didn't expect to see you</i>
<i>running with the pack.</i>

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.914
You've come against me once.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.956
Now I warn you.

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.077
I'll stay here
until I'm ready to leave.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:09.516
I use my gun for money,
and I don't like to work for nothing.

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.070
<i>But you trouble me again</i>
<i>and I may have to break my rule.</i>

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.636
That's my prescription, Physician.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.391
You'd better have it filled.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:48.237
You're not making any progress.
Keep working at it.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.914
- I thought you were going into town.
- After you finish breakfast.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.357
You've only been at it an hour.
We still have the rest of the day.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.351
Who's that?

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.791
It's Luke.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.599
- Good morning, Anne.
- Hello.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.353
- You all right?
- Why shouldn't I be?

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.476
We don't live
on the moon out here.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.518
I know about what happened in town,
and I know that you were part of it.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.956
Nothing came of it, honey,
so there's nothing to be excited about.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.996
- Good morning, Judge.
<i>- Good morning, Luke.</i>

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.277
But Buck Hastings said that Gant
threatened to kill you.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:32.158
That's a foolish thing for Buck to say.
When was he here?

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.879
He was sitting on the porch
waiting when I got up.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.350
- I don't think he had much sleep.
- Why did he bother you?

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:42.558
He was hoping I could suggest
something to do about Gant. I couldn't.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:46.235
I was with Buck until almost 2.00
this morning talking about the same thing.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.039
We couldn't come up
with any new answers either.

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:52.510
- Maybe we'd better go back
to the old way.
- You tried that last night.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.991
No, last night Asa and I were
angrier with Stricker and Reeger
than we were with Gant.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.753
We were the ones who insisted
on trying to talk with him.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.831
Luke, please don't
get involved in this.

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.070
But I am involved in it.
We all are.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.674
Can't sit back and have people afraid
to walk the streets.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.274
- Would you like some coffee?
- Oh, fine.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.476
I'll heat it up.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:15.030
Trouble is, I can't make
my mind accept that...

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.918
Gant is the vicious killer
I know him to be.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.913
I've played chess with him.
I've talked to him.
I found myself liking him.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.753
Viciousness in men, Luke, is inside.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.990
- Deep inside.
<i>- But why?</i>

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.311
What caused it? I keep wanting to know
what makes him tick.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.029
Well, it's usually a kind
of logical progression.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.270
A youngster starts
running with a gang.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:40.069
Sooner or later they're killed off
or sent to prison...

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.151
until he's the only one left.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.074
He's gotten away with killing
and he keeps going with it, alone.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.628
Pretty soon
he's everybody's enemy.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.711
He can't let himself
even like someone...

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.109
because someday
he might have to kill them.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.236
By then there's
no turning back.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.629
Even if he wants to
throw his gun away, he can't...

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.952
because he knows
that just around the bend
there's someone that'll kill him.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.351
A lot of that
could be just in his mind.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.590
Maybe he can quit
and get away with it.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:15.117
Maybe this killer around the bend
isn't there at all and is just
something he's afraid of.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.714
You're still wrestling with the idea that,
given half a chance...

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.995
you could talk him into
a different kind of life.

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.878
- I wish I could.
<i>- It wouldn't do any good, Luke.</i>

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.030
A man can't escape his past.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.951
Here we are.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:30.874
Just the coffee, honey.
I've got some patients in the office.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.270
If you can wait till I hitch up the buggy,
we can go to town together.

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.511
- I've got some shopping to do.
- All right, that's fine.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.838
Look at it.
And don't argue with me, Jim Merts.

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.036
That was cracked
when you sold it to me.

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.429
Then why didn't you say so then?

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.080
You can't hold me
responsible for-

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.111
- Here. Excuse me.
- Well!

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.068
About last night, Mr. Gant,
I hope you don't think
that I had anything-

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.991
Some shaving soap, please.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.957
Yes, sir.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.591
Good morning, Miss Benson.

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.511
Good morning.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.511
Excuse me.

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.276
You're a very lucky
young woman, Miss Benson.

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.669
I like the man
you're going to marry.

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.671
I find him remarkable.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.069
But he told me-
Well, last night-

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:30.358
I don't meet very many honest men.
I respect them when I do.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.271
Mr. Gant.

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.193
Mr. Merts, would you
send this on over to the house?

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.158
- I should be getting back to Dad.
- Sure, Anne.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.310
Excuse me, Mr. Gant.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:49.029
Miss Benson?

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.429
If I may, I'll walk with you.

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.670
If you like.

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.595
I understand
your father's an invalid.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.511
Yes.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.558
I'm sorry to hear that.
Nothing serious, I hope.

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.517
Well, I'm afraid so.

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.957
- Luke's been treating him.
He's a wonderful doctor.
- I'm sure of it.

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.316
- Your father's bedridden?
- No, not entirely.

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.709
But he is too weak
to leave the house.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.032
- He's a judge, isn't he?
- He was once. Why?

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.190
Judges interest me.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.078
They have the power
of life and death.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.991
So do physicians.

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.470
Mr. Gant, who have you
come to see?

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.268
Perhaps anyone, Miss Benson.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.828
I don't quite understand.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.718
Everyone has enemies,
Miss Benson.

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.631
Everyone.

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:44.395
I'd rather go the rest of
the way myself, Mr. Gant. Good day.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.190
Remember,
it's Stricker we want.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.909
If Gant or anybody else butts in,
do some shootin' and do it fast.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.798
- How about Buck Hastings?
- He won't be botherin' anybody.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.552
Come on. Let's go.

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.431
Dad, I'm home.

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.110
Secrets?

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.395
Not from you.

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.197
- What's the matter, honey?
- Nothing.

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.396
- It's funny.
- What is?

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.278
You'll never guess
who I was talking to today.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.954
Don't tell me
Luke has competition.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.598
It was John Gant.

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.155
- What did he want with you?
- I don't know.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.118
He just walked up to me
in the store and started talking.

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.714
Oh, Dad, you don't think
it's me he's after?

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.473
- No, no, no, of course not, but-
- Anne?

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.437
In here.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.514
I saw you from my window
talking with John Gant.

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.989
You too?
What's the matter with you men?

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.356
I don't like it. I don't want you
to have anything to do with him.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.829
You're being jealous,
Dr. Canfield. You actually are.

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.674
Don't be silly. It's just that
it's dangerous to be around him.

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.718
Somebody might decide to
take a shot at him any time.

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.268
Hello, Judge. How do you feel?

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.476
Fine.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.391
Sit down.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.311
All right.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.991
Luke, I've been thinking.

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:32.358
- I know how to stop your man for good.
- You do?

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.749
No one's been able
to convict Gant of murder...

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.832
because he's always been
able to prove self-defense.

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.309
He's never shot down
a man in cold blood.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.470
- That's my understanding.
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.075
But suppose the man Gant
has come after, whoever he is...

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.072
would be willing to die
to stop Gant for all time.

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.515
I don't follow you.

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.592
Suppose his man this time
refuses to defend himself...

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.514
would willingly sit there
and force Gant to commit murder.

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.431
That's a little farfetched, isn't it?

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.988
Nobody in his right mind
would let himself be murdered.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.389
No, I suppose not.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:10.554
It would be a hard thing to do,
to give up even a moment of life.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.438
Everybody wants to live.
Isn't that what you say?

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.839
- That's right.
- What are you doing?

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.595
Now look, Judge, I thought we agreed
there'd be no more smoking.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.989
It was a bad bargain.
You got me in a weak moment.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.550
Judge, I won't take the responsi-

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.516
It's Chaffee. He's headed
for Stricker's place. I'll see you later.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.150
Gabe! Frank! It's Chaffee!

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.151
Cover me.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.229
Stop it, you crazy fools!
Stop it! Stop it!

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.231
Stop it!

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.314
Doc, guess Stricker-

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.278
Guess Stricker didn't
need Gant after all.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.271
You're gonna be all right.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.794
Earl's dead, Doc, and Frank's got hit.
He's inside.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.553
In a minute.
Get my bag off my horse.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.391
Easy, Ben. Easy.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.432
I knew this was gonna happen.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.431
- I could have stopped it.
- It wasn't your fault, son.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.598
No, it wasn't. It was Gant's.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.070
You're a doctor, boy.
This is where you're needed most.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.791
All right, Dad.
Bring him inside.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.637
Make out my bill
and get my horse. I'm leaving.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.870
Oh. Yes, sir!

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.792
What are you doing?

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.474
Just tidying up a little.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.835
Why was the door closed?

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.911
I didn't realize they were.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.877
I have to go out for a while.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.633
You just came in
a little while ago.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.076
Well, I forgot to go
to the dressmaker's. I won't be long.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.911
Well, Miss Benson.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.195
Where can I find John Gant?

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.068
Why, he's up in his room,
number seven.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.038
But I wouldn't go up there
if I were you.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.231
Who is it?

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.437
<i>Anne Benson.</i>
<i>I want to talk to you, Mr. Gant.</i>

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.751
I'm gonna kill you, Mr. Gant.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.151
Would you mind telling me why?

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.038
Because I know now
that you've come to kill my father...

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.918
and I'm not gonna
let you do it.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.594
Then you should have
loaded your gun.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.470
- What was that?
- Anne Benson's up there.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.471
We'd better get
the doc over here.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.471
You stay here. I'll get him.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.034
Mr. Gant, please,
I beg you, don't do it.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.588
He hasn't long to live.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.870
I'm sorry about that.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.475
Oh, no, you're not.
You like to kill.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.996
But it won't do any good.
He's not going to defend
himself against you.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.833
He's going to make you murder him,
and they'll hang you!

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.639
He told Luke that that was
the only way to stop you.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.995
Kill him, and you'll hang!

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.072
Then I'll have to do
something about that, won't I?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.394
Luke.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.391
Luke!

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.031
- My bill.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.519
Luke!

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.238
She's still up there,
but Gant left.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.471
Anne?

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.391
Anne?

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.272
Anne!

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.269
Anne, it's Luke. What happened?

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.158
I'm all right. It's Dad!
He's gone after Dad!

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.470
- Take it easy.
- No, it's true! He admitted it!

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.949
Please, Luke, you've got
to stop him. Please!

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.751
Stay with her, Sid.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.718
- What happened?
- Gant's after the judge.
Is the buckboard hitched up?

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.233
Yeah.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.631
Mr. Gant?

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.636
Some of your former associates
back East send their regards.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.193
So I see.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.431
You're not afraid?

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:24.399
I've been dying for a long time.
Death's an old friend.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.318
But some of your other
old friends are impatient.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.868
They always were.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.591
What are they afraid of, Gant?

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.511
I didn't ask.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.558
I know anyway.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.838
No one knows the structure of an edifice
better than the architect.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.275
If I were to tell what I know...

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.478
it would send the governor
and the mayor...

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.279
and myself to jail.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.432
The two of them would make
distinguished convicts.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.195
- Perhaps.
- But killing me won't silence me.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.158
It'll all come out, anyway.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.276
That's their problem.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.551
Well, go ahead, Mr. Gant.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.676
I don't intend to resist you.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.272
Other men have warned me
that they wouldn't defend themselves...

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.396
but they all wound up trying.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.431
You have a lovely daughter.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.794
I found her
very pleasant company...

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.791
but I'm afraid
the feeling wasn't mutual.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.913
What are you talking about?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.436
I thought you might like
this little remembrance of her.

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.109
What did you do to her?

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.628
What did you do to her?

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.115
Gant, I'll-

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.720
Gant, I'll-

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.274
Gant, I'll kill you!

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.435
Gant, I'll-

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.110
I have no quarrel with you, Physician.
Stand aside.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.032
Gant!

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.838
- Luke, are you all right?
- I'm all right.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.720
Luke, he didn't
shoot the judge.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.077
A lot of people would
like to kill John Gant...

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.789
but it took a healer with a hammer
to make it easy for them.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.717
<i>Gant.</i>

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.429
I could take
a look at that arm.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.511
<i>Don't worry about it, Physician.</i>

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.029
Everything comes to a finish.
