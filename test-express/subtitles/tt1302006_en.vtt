<i>When I was young,</i>
<i>I thought house painters painted houses.</i>

00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:44.166
<i>What did I know?</i>

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.125
<i>I was a working guy.</i>

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:50.041
<i>A business agent for Teamster Local 107</i>

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:51.583
<i>out of South Philly.</i>

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:54.208
One of a thousand working stiffs...

00:01:56.833 --> 00:01:58.583
until I wasn't no more.

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:01.625
And then...

00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:04.666
I started painting houses...

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:07.916
myself.

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:25.208
<i>In this particular matter,</i>

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.833
<i>the whole thing was built
around the wedding.</i>

00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:34.375
Bill Bufalino's daughter
was getting married in Detroit.

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.583
Bill was a Teamster lawyer,
but more important,

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:38.625
he was Russell Bufalino's cousin.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.458
<i>Now, Russell didn't want to fly,</i>

00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.666
<i>so I was gonna drive him to the wedding.</i>

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.625
<i>He wanted to take care of
some business along the way,</i>

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:51.708
<i>which in Russell's case
meant only one thing:</i>

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.166
<i>Money... collecting it.</i>

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.666
<i>So we'd drive.</i>

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.875
<i>Him and his wife Carrie
and me and my wife Irene.</i>

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.791
<i>Or I call her Reenie.</i>

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:05.833
<i>I figured we would take 476 out of Philly,</i>

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:07.416
<i>and then we go up to Pittston</i>

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.666
<i>and pick up Russ,
which is usually how we did it,</i>

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.416
<i>and then Interstate 80 West</i>

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.083
<i>through the rest of Pennsylvania,</i>

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:18.875
<i>and then we'd go across Ohio,
all the way to Toledo,</i>

00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.500
<i>and then we would go 75 North to Detroit.</i>

00:03:25.708 --> 00:03:28.166
<i>It was gonna take about three days</i>

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.375
<i>with all the business breaks
and cigarette stops,</i>

00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:34.625
<i>since Russell didn't allow
nobody to smoke in the car.</i>

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:37.500
<i>He says Jimmy Blue Eyes and Meyer Lansky</i>

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:40.333
<i>convinced him to stop smoking
when they were getting kicked out</i>

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:43.458
<i>of their casinos in Cuba
and getting shot at by Castro.</i>

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.166
<i>I don't know.
It might have been one of those,</i>

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.541
<i>"Please-God-if-I-ever-get-out-
of-this-fucking-thing-alive-</i>

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:51.541
<i>I'll-never-smoke-again things too."</i>

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:54.708
<i>But I do know that from Castro on,</i>

00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.125
<i>Russ wouldn't allow
nobody to smoke in his car,</i>

00:03:57.208 --> 00:03:58.583
<i>not even Carrie.</i>

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Can we stop soon?

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.000
We're only in the car two minutes, honey.

00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:26.000
We're not even near the highway.

00:04:26.083 --> 00:04:29.041
I know, Russell.
But you don't like to stop on the highway.

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.333
Well, it's not that so much.

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:33.916
They don't <i>let</i> you stop on the highway.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.250
Okay, so then we'll smoke in the car.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.958
And what about my cataracts?

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:43.500
I'll crack the window.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.291
Carrie, I made a vow.
Remember?

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:50.791
Remember I made a vow, Carrie?

00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:53.291
Yeah,
now I can't smoke on...

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:55.791
All right, and now I can't smoke.

00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:16.458
See where we are?

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:22.958
Is... Is that...

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:26.125
What are those odds?

00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:30.000
What's the problem, kid?

00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:36.375
I don't... I don't know. It sounds funny.

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:38.791
It stops, it starts, it loses power.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.916
Let me see if I can give you a hand.

00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:47.416
Let me see.
Check all these plugs.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.916
Spark plugs are okay.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.875
The distributor cap's okay.

00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:53.791
Good.

00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:56.291
It's gotta be something with...
with this.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.666
Uh-oh. Timing chain.

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:01.875
This is what this is. There's a cap on it.

00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.583
This cap is loose.
It ain't supposed to be loose.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.583
So that means they're getting worn out.

00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:08.750
You just gotta...

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:11.333
Try that now. Tighten it up.

00:07:15.458 --> 00:07:16.291
Huh?

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:19.583
I can drive 'em. I can't fix 'em.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:21.375
You're back in business, kid.

00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:22.666
Thanks.

00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:26.333
- I owe you anything?
- No.

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:28.333
No, you don't owe me anything.

00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:29.375
Oh, thanks.

00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:32.000
- Frank.
- Hey, Frank. How ya doing?

00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:35.875
What's your name?

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:40.625
Where you from?

00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:43.416
- Philly.
- Oh, you're from Philly.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.541
- Yeah.
- Ah.

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:47.958
Where you hang out there?

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:49.708
Callahan's.

00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:53.375
Bocce Club. But it's a bar,
it's not a bocce club.

00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.833
Oh, yeah. You play bocce?

00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:58.041
- Nah.
- Oh.

00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:01.041
All right, Frankie... get that fixed.

00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:02.541
Because it'll go again on you,
I'm telling you.

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:03.625
- Thank you.
- All right.

00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:05.750
- I will. Thanks again.
- Good luck, buddy.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.166
I mean,
I thought maybe he owned the gas station.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.541
'Cause he owned something, you could tell.

00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:15.666
Yeah, it turns out
he owned the whole road.

Say hello to your wife, huh?

00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:55.916
I got a way you can earn,
to push those hindquarters.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.500
There's a guy in here,
he'll pay a lot of money for them.

00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:00.916
Come on, let's shoot this first
and then we'll talk business.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.958
At the other end of the bar,
at twelve o'clock...

00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.833
You see him?
He's got a rescinding hairline.

00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:08.458
Yeah, you'll make
a lot of money with him.

00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:11.291
See him there?
Skinny Razor. He owns the place.

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:12.375
Razor?

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:14.708
He shylocks
and runs a little book out of the joint.

00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:16.833
He's got a lot of good action,
good connections.

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:20.458
- Razor's his name?
- Yeah, he used to work at a butcher shop.

00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.750
My friend Frank Irish is here.
The one I told you about?

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.708
- Oh, the truck.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.458

00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:50.625

- I could.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.083

00:12:16.708 --> 00:12:18.250

I don't know.

No. I just... Nothing. It felt fine.

- It's empty.

I'm telling you right now.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.750
Me, I just drive the truck.
That's all I do.

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:01.208

00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:02.708
Yeah, you said right.

- On the job?
- Yeah.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.375
- No.
- Okay.

00:13:21.916 --> 00:13:23.666
What about stealing, that ain't grounds?

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.250
Well...

00:13:25.916 --> 00:13:27.250
can they prove it?

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.625
I don't think so.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.333
All right then, we don't have
nothing to worry about.

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:35.541
If they can prove it,

00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:38.708
they're just gonna want names from you.
Accomplices.

00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:40.875
That's all. You give them
a couple of names, you go home.

00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:42.458
Keep your job.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.666
What do you think about that?

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.708
- Would you give them names?
- No. No names.

00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.000
You know, I don't, uh...

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.708
I don't care whether you did it or not.

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:57.416
That makes no difference to me.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.041
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm here to defend you. Right?

00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:01.083
Right.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.666
What, you want to know if I did it or not?

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.791
Well...

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:12.208
I'm gonna defend you either way.

00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:13.500
Yeah, all right, but...

00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:19.958
I, I work hard for them
when I ain't stealing from 'em.

00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:24.833
Your Honor,
if this was about right or wrong,

00:14:24.916 --> 00:14:27.333
the company would have
sought Mr. Sheeran's dismissal.

00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:28.416
They didn't.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.125
They only accused Mr. Sheeran

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:32.541
because the company hoped
he could name conspirators,

00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:35.791
which he couldn't do
because they don't exist.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.625
They don't exist
because he didn't steal anything.

00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:42.250
He didn't steal anything
because he's an exemplary employee,

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:45.666
who in eight years
has never taken a day of sick leave.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.375
The only rule he ever broke
is his own union's,

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:51.708
by helping others
carry sides of beef from his truck

00:14:51.791 --> 00:14:54.541
to their refrigerators
in the dead of winter.

00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:58.583
All rise.

00:14:58.666 --> 00:14:59.666
Court is in session.

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.875
I'm dismissing this case
with a warning.

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.333
Yes, Your Honor.

00:15:04.416 --> 00:15:05.750
No, no, not you, Mr. Sheeran.

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:08.375
You bring another working man
before this court

00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:10.375
with threats instead of evidence,

00:15:10.458 --> 00:15:11.750
believe me, you'll be sorry.

00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:14.250
If I owned stock in this company,
I would sell it.

00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:18.125
<i>I don't know how he did it,</i>
<i>and I ain't gonna ask.</i>

00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:21.708
<i>All I know is that Bill Bufalino
got me out of a case</i>

00:15:21.791 --> 00:15:24.250
<i>where I should never
have gotten away with it.</i>

00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:25.583
<i>I should've been down for the count.</i>

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:27.916
People are gonna appreciate
what you did today, Frank.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.041
You know, they got families,
they got kids.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.416
They need those jobs.

00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.500
<i>Instead,</i>
<i>we went out celebrating...</i>

00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:37.791
Russell!

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:40.416
<i>...and I met</i>
<i>what was gonna turn out to be</i>

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.500
<i>the rest of my life.</i>

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:43.791
You know, I thought that was you
walking in outside.

00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:45.416
Yeah, yeah, you know,
this is our place.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.750
Can I introduce you to this new guy Frank?

00:15:47.833 --> 00:15:49.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.791
Frank, I want you to meet
my cousin Russell Bufalino.

00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:53.541
- How are ya?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:55.625
You helped me with my truck
a couple of months ago.

00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:57.958
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
The timing chain.

00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.750
- Yeah.
- Did you get it fixed?

00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:01.500
- I fixed it the next day, yeah.
- Attaboy.

00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:03.583
- Thanks again.
- Oh, you're welcome.

00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:05.166
My pleasure. I'm glad you fixed it.

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:12.208
You better watch.

00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:14.458
There's a lot of tough guys around here.
Did he tell ya?

00:16:15.916 --> 00:16:17.375
You're not afraid of tough guys, are ya?

00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:18.291
No.

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:20.416
I didn't think so. I'll see you around.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.583
- Okay.
- Thanks, Russell.

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:23.583
Your cousin saved my ass.

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:25.375
I could've lost the whole load.

00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:28.000
Yeah, yeah. Well, he knows
everything about trucks, really.

00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:29.916
Yeah, he worked at Canada Dry
for a long time.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.166
- Vito, how are you?
- Pleasure.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.958
I think, uh... Let's take the booth.

00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:34.666
Come on. You're gonna love this.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.041
<i>Maybe I didn't know</i>

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:38.500
<i>who Russell Bufalino was back then,</i>

00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:41.791
<i>but I'd seen enough pictures and stories
in the newspapers</i>

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:43.875
<i>to know he was eatin' with Angelo Bruno.</i>

00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:48.333
<i>I mean, Bruno, he... he was just made
the new boss of Philadelphia.</i>

00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:51.208
<i>He took care of everything
from Philadelphia to Atlantic City.</i>

00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:52.458
<i>That, I knew.</i>

00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:02.083
<i>And that was all I had to know</i>

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:03.666
<i>to know that Russell Bufalino</i>

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.540
<i>was no truck mechanic from Canada Dry.</i>

00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:12.958
This bread is very good.

00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.125
Good, eh?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.958
Where did an Irisher like you
learn to speak Italian?

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.375
In Italy - the war.

00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:25.583
Ah. Where?

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.540
Salerno.

00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:29.833
Anzio.

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:32.375
Sicily...

00:17:32.458 --> 00:17:33.708
around Catania.

00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:36.708
Catania? I'm from Catania.

00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:40.208
Yeah? I thought you had
an accent like Catania.

00:17:43.291 --> 00:17:45.666
How long were you in the war?

00:17:46.458 --> 00:17:47.666
Four years.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.208
411 days in combat...

00:17:51.916 --> 00:17:53.875
122 at Anzio.

00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:56.375
Forty-fifth Infantry.

00:17:57.541 --> 00:17:58.833
<i>Minchia.</i>

00:17:58.916 --> 00:18:01.208
- Yeah. Yeah.
<i>- Minchia.</i>

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.291
Were you afraid of dying?

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:08.750
Always afraid.

00:18:09.416 --> 00:18:13.000
And don't let anybody
tell you that they weren't afraid.

00:18:13.083 --> 00:18:15.125
- That's a lot of bullshit. You know?
- Yeah.

00:18:15.208 --> 00:18:17.458
Everybody's afraid.
And you pray a lot.

00:18:18.083 --> 00:18:19.583
I prayed a lot.

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:22.208
I prayed that I'd never sin again
as long as I live

00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:23.875
if I could just get out of here.

00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:29.041
But then the fighting starts
and then you forget about everything.

00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:32.333
You're just trying to survive,
stay alive.

00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:36.375
Once I saw
that I was getting through the war,

00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:38.416
I looked around me, I said...

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.583
I said, "From now on,
whatever happens, happens."

00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:45.833
<i>Che successe successe.</i>
Fuck it.

00:18:46.916 --> 00:18:49.500
You know, you got orders, you follow them.

00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:52.458
They tell you to bring some prisoners
into... into the woods,

00:18:52.541 --> 00:18:55.625
you know,
and they don't tell you what to do...

00:18:56.416 --> 00:18:58.833
But they just say, you know, "Hurry up."

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:04.416
<i>It's crazy, but I never understood</i>

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.791
<i>how they would just keep digging</i>

00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:08.416
<i>their own graves, you know. I mean...</i>

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.625
Stop!

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.250
<i>Raus!</i>

00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.875
<i>Well, I mean,</i>
<i>maybe they thought if they did a good job,</i>

00:19:18.708 --> 00:19:20.458
<i>the guy with the gun</i>

00:19:21.041 --> 00:19:22.583
<i>would change his mind.</i>

00:19:39.041 --> 00:19:42.250
<i>Russell,</i>
<i>he... he took a shine to me right away.</i>

00:19:43.666 --> 00:19:44.750
<i>After a while,</i>

00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:48.250
<i>he started giving me little things to do.</i>

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:51.333
<i>But then Angelo himself,</i>

00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:53.541
<i>he started giving me
little things to do too.</i>

00:19:57.458 --> 00:20:00.041
<i>Russ's wife, Carrie, her family</i>

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:01.958
<i>goes all the way back, way, way back</i>

00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:04.708
<i>to the same town in Sicily
as the Bufalinos.</i>

00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:07.625
<i>They talked about it all the time.</i>

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:10.750
<i>She came from mob royalty,
if you want to call it that.</i>

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.958
<i>To them,
it was like they came over on the...</i>

00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.041
<i>the Italian Mayflower.</i>

00:20:44.416 --> 00:20:46.875
Why don't you go upstairs, wash up.

00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:50.333
Give me those clothes.
I'll get rid of them.

00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:56.166
Don't forget your shoes, Russell.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.666
Hey, Frank,

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.708
can we stop soon?

00:21:08.791 --> 00:21:12.250
Yeah, yeah,
well, ask your husband. Russell?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.333
He's out cold.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.708
No, no, I got it.

00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:26.875
- Sure?
- Yeah.

00:21:33.416 --> 00:21:34.500
Where are we?

00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:35.833
We're close to Lewisburg.

00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:38.833
Let me know when we get there.
Remind me.

00:21:38.916 --> 00:21:41.041
- I got some stops to make.
- Okay.

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:54.458
<i>Russell had a piece of everything.</i>

00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:02.041
<i>He had this store in Pittston
called Penn Drape &amp; Curtains.</i>

00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:03.958
<i>And he ran everything out of there.</i>

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.583
<i>Who knew what it all was?</i>

00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:08.458
<i>I mean, I'm sure the man had partners.</i>

00:22:08.541 --> 00:22:10.291
<i>They always have partners.</i>

00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:12.083
<i>Nobody keeps all the money.</i>

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:16.125
<i>But everybody listened to Russ.
That I can tell you.</i>

00:22:16.666 --> 00:22:19.875
<i>You wanted to bribe a judge,
you asked Russell.</i>

00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:22.291
<i>You didn't know how much to bribe him,</i>

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:24.125
<i>Russell was gonna tell you.</i>

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.333
All right, all right.
Uh, I'll be right there.

00:22:28.208 --> 00:22:30.125
Come on. I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

00:22:30.208 --> 00:22:32.791
<i>You want to promote</i>
<i>one of your guys,</i>

00:22:32.875 --> 00:22:35.583
<i>Russ would tell you
you could or you could not.</i>

00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:36.833
Do me a favor.

00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:39.500
Go with Steve down to his place.
Take Vito with you.

00:22:39.583 --> 00:22:40.791
And just hang around for a while.

00:22:40.875 --> 00:22:42.958
These guys keep coming around,
so straighten them out.

00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:44.416
- I'll take care of it, Russ.
- Okay.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.583
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:46.791
Where's... Oh, here you are.

00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:47.708
I'm right here.

00:22:47.791 --> 00:22:49.666
<i>You want</i>
<i>to make somebody disappear,</i>

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.458
<i>you got to get Russell's permission.</i>

00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:53.291
<i>You know, no two ways about it.</i>

00:22:53.375 --> 00:22:56.208
- No, I wasn't worried.
- I didn't think so.

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:58.958
- Tell your father I said "Hi."
- I'll tell him. Thanks.

00:22:59.041 --> 00:23:00.666
What are you doing here?
I just told Bruno.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.750
You gotta go with Bruno.

00:23:01.833 --> 00:23:03.416
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.
- Yeah. Take care.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.416
<i>And when you did something</i>
<i>for Russ,</i>

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.208
<i>you did it yourself.</i>

00:23:07.291 --> 00:23:09.083
<i>Like Russ used to say...</i>

00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:11.666
<i>When I ask somebody</i>
<i>to take care of something for me,</i>

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.833
I expect them
to take care of it themselves.

00:23:13.916 --> 00:23:16.250
I don't need two roads coming back to me.

00:24:20.666 --> 00:24:23.500
<i>When Anastasia</i>
<i>got killed in the barbershop,</i>

00:24:23.583 --> 00:24:26.625
<i>it was Russell they brought in
to calm things down,</i>

00:24:26.708 --> 00:24:29.416
<i>so that everybody
wasn't just going around killing everybody</i>

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.916
<i>and it could all get straightened out.</i>

00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:34.250
We know what happened.

00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:36.333
We can't change it. It is what it is.

00:24:36.416 --> 00:24:39.291
Please tell my friend I'm happy to help.

00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:41.958
<i>You'd never know it</i>
<i>by looking at this guy,</i>

00:24:42.041 --> 00:24:44.958
<i>but all roads led back to Russ.</i>

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:53.958
Where's the money?

00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:55.583
- He don't have it.
- He don't have it?

00:24:56.375 --> 00:24:58.500
He said something about his mother...

00:24:58.583 --> 00:24:59.583
Stop. Don't tell me.

00:24:59.666 --> 00:25:00.666
Let me guess.

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:03.541
His mother died
and the funeral set him back.

00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:06.333
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

00:25:06.416 --> 00:25:07.791
His fucking mother's...

00:25:07.875 --> 00:25:09.958
fucking dying over and over
for the last ten years.

00:25:12.375 --> 00:25:13.333
What do I do?

00:25:13.416 --> 00:25:14.750
Don't leave.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.458
Here.

00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:30.833
Just show it to him. Don't use it.

00:25:48.666 --> 00:25:50.000
Hey. Look.

00:25:50.083 --> 00:25:51.083
Hey, Frank.

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:55.250
Skinny wants to see you.
You get in the car.

00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:57.708
- I was just gonna go see him.
- Get in the fucking car.

00:25:58.666 --> 00:26:00.041
- I was just gonna...
- Get in the fucking car!

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:02.041
- I was just gonna go see him!
- Yeah, don't get cute with me.

00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:03.416
You give me that bullshit
about your mother.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.625
Get in the fucking car!

00:26:04.708 --> 00:26:05.958
Frank, I swear to God,
I was just gonna...

00:26:06.041 --> 00:26:07.625
Get in the fucking car!

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:13.750
You want to get cute with me?

00:26:13.833 --> 00:26:15.500
All that fucking bullshit
about your mother

00:26:15.583 --> 00:26:17.375
and sick and all that and dying.

00:26:17.458 --> 00:26:18.708
I swear,
I was just gonna go see him.

00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:19.625
You'll see him right now.

00:26:19.708 --> 00:26:21.375
I swear to God,
I was gonna come see you tomorrow.

00:26:21.458 --> 00:26:22.958
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow. I swear to God.

00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:24.916
Tomorrow. Here.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
- What time?
- What time do you want me?

00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:27.250
One o'clock? I'll be here at 1:00.

00:26:27.333 --> 00:26:29.333
One o'clock? What, are you sleeping in?

00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:31.041
You tell me.

00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:32.958
Ten o'clock. Here.

00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:34.291
- Ten o'clock. Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:37.166
Swear on your mother.
Swear on your mother!

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.000
- Swear on your mother!
- I swear on my mother!

00:26:39.083 --> 00:26:39.916
I swear on my mother!

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.333
What time you gonna be here tomorrow?

00:26:41.416 --> 00:26:43.000
- I'll be here at ten o'clock.
- Ten o'clock?

00:26:43.083 --> 00:26:45.250
- Tomorrow. Here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:47.333
I'll bring you the money tomorrow.
The whole thing.

00:26:47.416 --> 00:26:48.416
Get him out of here.

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:50.791
Get out of here.

00:26:51.416 --> 00:26:53.416
I swear to God, I'll be here.
How am I supposed to get home?

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.166
- Get out of here.
- Take the fucking bus!

00:26:58.041 --> 00:26:59.541
Let his mother pick him up.

00:27:10.375 --> 00:27:11.791
What's the matter with her?

00:27:12.291 --> 00:27:13.625
Nothing.
She knocked something over

00:27:13.708 --> 00:27:16.416
at the grocery store and made a mess,

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.500
- and the grocer yelled at her.
- He yelled at her?

00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:19.958
Yeah, and he shoved her.

00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:21.125
He shoved her?

00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:23.291
Yeah.

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:24.333
Did he shove you?

00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:27.083
Who was this? The guy at the store?

00:27:27.166 --> 00:27:29.041
The grocery store on the corner? Joe?

00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:33.666
Did he?

00:27:34.583 --> 00:27:35.958
Honey, did he shove you?

00:27:37.916 --> 00:27:39.750
Just answer me. Did he push you?

00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:42.125
Did he shove you?
Whatever it is, did he do that?

00:27:42.791 --> 00:27:43.791
Let's go.

00:27:46.666 --> 00:27:47.875
Frank.

00:27:47.958 --> 00:27:50.458
Frank, he didn't mean it, the man.
It just happened.

00:27:50.541 --> 00:27:51.541
What do you mean,
he didn't mean it?

00:27:51.625 --> 00:27:52.875
He touched her.
What, are you kidding me?

00:27:52.958 --> 00:27:54.708
He has no right to push her. Touch her.

00:27:54.791 --> 00:27:56.916
Not even put one pinky on her.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.250
That's him, right?

00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:06.541
Stay here. Stay here.

00:28:10.208 --> 00:28:12.625
Frank, I'm sorry,
but your kid was out of line.

00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:14.458
- I only did what...
- You touched my daughter?

00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:21.666
God, I'm sorry.

00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:23.708
No. Please. No, no, Frank.

00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:25.750
Frank, please, please, please. No.

00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:35.291
No, no, Frank! No!

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:41.208
- Take that, you motherfucker!
- No! Come on!

00:28:43.916 --> 00:28:48.041
Oh, my fucking hand.
My fucking hand!

00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:14.708
Dolores.

00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:24.125
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:29:24.208 --> 00:29:27.541
<i>Russell and Carrie baptized</i>
<i>our new daughter, Dolores.</i>

00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:31.458
<i>It was a wonderful occasion,
and we were honored.</i>

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:33.500
<i>Everybody showed up.</i>

00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:34.583
Amen.

00:29:54.166 --> 00:29:55.333
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:29:55.416 --> 00:29:57.041
<i>The only thing is,</i>

00:29:57.125 --> 00:29:59.875
<i>you got more kids,
you gotta earn more money.</i>

00:30:02.708 --> 00:30:04.625
You wanna make a quick ten grand?

00:30:05.458 --> 00:30:07.166
<i>Whispers DiTullio.</i>
<i>Not the Whispers</i>

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.541
<i>they blew up in that car
around the same time.</i>

00:30:11.625 --> 00:30:12.833
<i>This was the other Whispers.</i>

00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:14.500
<i>The good one who knew how to make money.</i>

00:30:15.541 --> 00:30:17.333
I got this place I front money to.

00:30:17.416 --> 00:30:19.416
It's a good business.
Really good business.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.541
It's a laundry.

00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:22.958
What they do is,
they collect the linen, towels,

00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:27.125
<i>sheets and everything from all the hotels
and restaurants in Atlantic City.</i>

00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:28.458
<i>They wash it, they iron it.</i>

00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:32.041
Normally, it's like a license
to print fucking money.

00:30:32.125 --> 00:30:33.666
Until recently.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.875
There's this other company
that opened up down in Delaware.

00:30:36.958 --> 00:30:38.500
They're trying to put us out of business.

00:30:38.583 --> 00:30:42.666
<i>They're cutting their prices.
They're scaring our drivers.</i>

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.250
<i>They're trying to take
our customers from us.</i>

00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:48.791
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little concerned.

00:30:48.875 --> 00:30:51.833
<i>Whenever anybody says</i>
<i>they're a little concerned,</i>

00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:53.208
<i>they're very concerned.</i>

00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:55.125
As a matter of fact,

00:30:55.208 --> 00:30:57.333
I'm really more than a little concerned.

00:30:57.416 --> 00:31:00.875
<i>And when they say</i>
<i>they're more than a little concerned,</i>

00:31:00.958 --> 00:31:02.083
<i>they're desperate.</i>

00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:04.125
I want this fucking place bombed,

00:31:04.208 --> 00:31:06.416
burnt, torched,
whatever the fuck you have to do.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.291
You were in the war. You know what to do.

00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:11.333
Leave that fucking place
like you left Berlin.

00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:13.208
Burnt to the fucking ground.

00:31:13.291 --> 00:31:15.416
I want them out of fucking business.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.000
Who... Who are they?

00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:20.083
It's the Cadillac Linen Service
in Delaware.

00:31:20.833 --> 00:31:22.541
It's run by a bunch of Jews.

00:31:22.625 --> 00:31:26.208
Let them collect their insurance,
which I'm sure they have plenty,

00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:28.458
and leave this fucking other place alone,

00:31:28.541 --> 00:31:30.166
the one I'm involved in.

00:31:31.666 --> 00:31:33.583
- This ain't ten grand.
- It's two grand.

00:31:33.666 --> 00:31:35.625
When you put
these Jew fucking washerwomen

00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:38.458
out of business,
then you get the rest of your money.

00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:41.458
The reason I'm a little short
on the money right now,

00:31:41.541 --> 00:31:42.958
I don't wanna go to Skinny,

00:31:43.041 --> 00:31:45.625
I don't wanna ask anybody
when they're gonna charge me a vig,

00:31:45.708 --> 00:31:47.416
and I'm gonna be paying them forever.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.333
I'm getting the money somewhere else.

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.583
And nobody has to know.

00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:52.666
Especially not Skinny

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.708
because I'm not getting
the money from him.

00:31:56.375 --> 00:31:58.166
And I see you look a little hesitant.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.416
Believe me, I know what you can do.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.375
If I stiff you on the money,

00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:04.625
you're gonna do something terrible to me.

00:32:04.708 --> 00:32:06.750
I do not want that.

00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:20.000
I hit the number.

00:32:20.083 --> 00:32:21.583
It's about 1,500.

00:32:22.083 --> 00:32:23.666
I'll see you in a few hours.

00:34:06.375 --> 00:34:07.500
Hey, Frank.

00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:09.541
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:34:09.625 --> 00:34:11.041
Angelo wants to see you.

00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:14.291
- Now?
- Yeah, now is good.

00:34:15.125 --> 00:34:16.208
What's it about?

00:34:16.291 --> 00:34:18.750
I don't know. Come on. I'll drive you.

00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:53.291
Sit down, Frank.

00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:07.458
What're you doing in Delaware?

00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:15.750
Bombing out a laundry place.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.291
Uh, I was just doing a job
to make some extra money.

00:35:28.166 --> 00:35:30.166
Putting this place out of action.

00:35:31.291 --> 00:35:34.791
Putting this...
Putting this place out of commission.

00:35:36.625 --> 00:35:37.708
For who?

00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:50.416
Now is not the time to not say.

00:35:54.125 --> 00:35:55.125
Um...

00:35:55.791 --> 00:35:57.166
Whispers.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.458
The other Whispers.

00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:05.208
You know who owns
the Cadillac Linen Service?

00:36:06.291 --> 00:36:08.083
Some Jews in the laundry business.

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:11.083
- That's what they told me.
- They own a part of it.

00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:12.875
Somebody else got an interest in that.

00:36:12.958 --> 00:36:14.041
- You know who?
- No.

00:36:14.125 --> 00:36:15.000
I do.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.708
- Who?
- No. I do.

00:36:18.791 --> 00:36:20.250
I own the other part.

00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:22.958
Not I know somebody
who owns the other part.

00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:29.833
Angelo, I didn't know
you had any part of it.

00:36:29.916 --> 00:36:31.583
I would never have done what I did

00:36:31.666 --> 00:36:33.291
if I knew you were involved.
I didn't know.

00:36:33.375 --> 00:36:35.791
I would never, never do that against you.

00:36:35.875 --> 00:36:37.875
Whispers didn't tell you it was Jew mob?

00:36:37.958 --> 00:36:39.291
No, he said Jew washerwomen.

00:36:42.666 --> 00:36:44.083
Jew washerwomen.

00:36:45.583 --> 00:36:46.458
What else he say?

00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:49.666
I bet he said keep it to yourself.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.875
Don't say nothing to nobody Downtown.

00:36:55.083 --> 00:36:55.916
He did.

00:37:01.833 --> 00:37:03.416
I didn't check.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.208
I'm sorry. I should've checked.

00:37:05.291 --> 00:37:07.250
- Can I give him his money back?
- He won't need it.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.208
You can keep it.

00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:10.750
I... I don't want no trouble.

00:37:10.833 --> 00:37:13.083
I'll just give it back to him
and I'm okay.

00:37:13.916 --> 00:37:15.125
He won't need it.

00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:21.083
Okay. Thanks.

00:37:21.166 --> 00:37:22.375
Thank Russell.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
I wouldn't have wasted my time.

00:37:24.083 --> 00:37:25.291
I'd have let the Jew mob have you.

00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:30.458
You got a good friend here.

00:37:31.125 --> 00:37:32.750
You don't know how good a friend you got.

00:37:33.958 --> 00:37:36.291
- Oh, I... I know.
- No, you don't know.

00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:41.708
Wait by the bar, would you?

00:37:58.166 --> 00:37:59.541
<i>In a case like this,</i>

00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:02.916
<i>the best thing to do is
you use something brand new.</i>

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.416
<i>Right out of the box.</i>

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.416
<i>Otherwise, you don't know where it's been.</i>

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.208
<i>You don't know who's used it,</i>

00:38:08.291 --> 00:38:10.583
<i>what crime it was connected to.</i>

00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:12.208
<i>That's suicide.</i>

00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:16.250
<i>So I recommend something new,
straight out of the... the box.</i>

00:38:16.333 --> 00:38:18.166
<i>Stone cold. Clean.</i>

00:38:21.458 --> 00:38:22.875
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

00:38:22.958 --> 00:38:24.666
I didn't know which way
you were coming from.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.208
- Huh?
- I didn't know which way...

00:38:33.458 --> 00:38:34.708
<i> Naturally,</i>
<i>the next thing you wanna do</i>

00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:36.916
is throw the thing away.
You wanna get rid of it.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.041
<i>There's a spot
in the Schuylkill River everybody uses.</i>

00:38:43.875 --> 00:38:47.333
<i>If they ever send divers down there,
they'd be able to arm a small country.</i>

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:14.208
<i>For me,</i>
<i>everything changed after Whispers.</i>

00:39:19.416 --> 00:39:20.333
<i>It was like the army.</i>

00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:23.041
<i>You followed orders.</i>

00:39:25.625 --> 00:39:26.875
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

00:39:27.583 --> 00:39:28.875
You got rewarded.

00:39:30.875 --> 00:39:33.708
<i>And when I handled things for Russell,</i>

00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:35.208
<i>it was never for money,</i>

00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:37.125
<i>but as a show of respect.</i>

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.875
<i>When you ran a little errand,
you did a little favor,</i>

00:39:39.958 --> 00:39:42.708
<i>you got a little favor back
if you ever needed it.</i>

00:39:42.791 --> 00:39:44.708
<i>And you always hurried back.</i>

00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:46.083
- Hey, Phil, how you doing?
- How are you?

00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:51.416
<i>♪ See the pyramids along the Nile ♪</i>

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.000

<i>♪ You belong to me... ♪</i>

00:40:07.083 --> 00:40:09.000

00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:10.500
What can I get for you?

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.458
Uh, I'm just gonna get the wine now.

00:40:14.708 --> 00:40:15.958
Okay.

00:40:16.041 --> 00:40:18.083
Just call me if you need anything.

00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:19.000
I will.

00:40:24.166 --> 00:40:26.416
- Help yourself, Frank.
- Thanks.

00:40:27.583 --> 00:40:28.541
Things change.

00:40:33.166 --> 00:40:35.375
- She's the new one, right?
- Yeah.

00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:37.833
A nice kid. Nice kid.

00:40:39.208 --> 00:40:40.208
Yeah.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.583
Hey, Ira, what's going on?

00:41:05.666 --> 00:41:07.750
- Good. All well?
- Yes.

00:41:09.291 --> 00:41:11.583
- Any problems?
- No. Everything's good.

00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:13.333
Thank you.

00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:16.250
Right after this Caddy, pull over.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.250
There it is. Fair Furriers.

00:41:22.375 --> 00:41:24.250
He's expecting you.

00:41:49.958 --> 00:41:52.083
Phil, you got a nice shop here.

00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:53.000
Thanks.

00:41:53.083 --> 00:41:55.083
People like
to come to this store.

00:41:55.166 --> 00:41:57.666
But your kid is a real <i>sfigato.</i>

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.666
You understand? He's a pain in the ass.

00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:02.541
He's a wild kid.
You gotta learn to control him.

00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:03.541
And if you don't,

00:42:03.625 --> 00:42:06.291
nobody's gonna want to shop here anymore.

00:42:06.375 --> 00:42:09.250
If it's not good for you,
it's not good for me.

00:42:10.083 --> 00:42:12.458
You understand what I'm saying.

00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:14.958
I want to apologize, Russell,
for the aggravation.

00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:17.583
This is from Russell and I.
That's from you and Frank.

00:42:17.666 --> 00:42:19.291
This one'll be from you and me.

00:42:19.375 --> 00:42:20.791
Well, what about a baby spoon?

00:42:21.666 --> 00:42:23.041
What's she gonna do with a baby spoon?

00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:24.416
- They're not even married.
- Have a baby.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.958
They're not even married yet.

00:42:26.041 --> 00:42:27.458
I give you my word, Russ.

00:42:27.541 --> 00:42:29.958
- All right. Your word's good, Phil.
- Thank you.

00:42:30.041 --> 00:42:31.791
Okay, let's go, girls.

00:42:31.875 --> 00:42:33.541
- Okay, we're done?
- Yes, we're done.

00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:36.666
What are you doing? Huh?

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.791
- When the hell are you gonna wise up, huh?
- What?

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.500
Whoa!

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.125
There we go. That's my girl.

00:42:55.208 --> 00:42:56.875
Oh, my God!

00:43:02.041 --> 00:43:04.000
Yes!

00:43:07.583 --> 00:43:08.458
Hey, Peggy.

00:43:10.166 --> 00:43:11.375
Come over here.

00:43:14.958 --> 00:43:16.166
I don't know. I don't...

00:43:17.625 --> 00:43:18.916
I get the feeling she don't like me.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.625
- Like she's afraid of me.
- No, no.

00:43:20.708 --> 00:43:22.125
That's the way she is.

00:43:22.208 --> 00:43:23.708
She's afraid of me at times too.

00:43:23.791 --> 00:43:25.750
So, uh, it's just she's a sensitive kid,

00:43:25.833 --> 00:43:26.916
but that's all it is.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.583
I can understand her being afraid of me,

00:43:28.666 --> 00:43:29.958
but she shouldn't be scared of you, Frank.

00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:31.041
No, well...

00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:33.375
And then she hears about me
in the papers sometimes...

00:43:33.458 --> 00:43:34.708
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:43:34.791 --> 00:43:36.958
You gotta be close to your kids, Frank.

00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:37.916
I am. I am.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.541
You're blessed to have them.

00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:41.708
I mean, Carrie and I can't have kids.
I told you.

00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:44.458
But you're blessed. You're blessed.

00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:46.125
Call her. Call her. Tell her to come over.

00:43:46.208 --> 00:43:48.416
Hey. Sweetheart. Peggy. Come here.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.375
Come here.

00:43:55.125 --> 00:43:56.916
- Come here.
- Come over by Uncle Russ.

00:43:58.083 --> 00:43:59.916
- How are you?
- Good.

00:44:00.791 --> 00:44:03.791
Do you know why
God made the sky so high?

00:44:05.041 --> 00:44:06.416
No.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.375
So that the little birdies
don't bunk their head on it

00:44:09.458 --> 00:44:10.958
when they're flying around.

00:44:11.625 --> 00:44:13.625
Isn't that cute?

00:44:13.708 --> 00:44:15.250
A little joke. Huh?

00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:16.708
Isn't that funny?

00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:18.083
You want some candy
or something?

00:44:18.166 --> 00:44:19.500
No.

00:44:19.583 --> 00:44:21.708
No, you guys don't want any candy.

00:44:23.291 --> 00:44:25.583
There's nothing I could do for you?

00:44:25.666 --> 00:44:26.791
No.

00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:28.875
Well, if there is,
you let Uncle Russell know.

00:44:28.958 --> 00:44:30.000
Okay.

00:44:30.083 --> 00:44:31.541
Go back. Have some fun.

00:44:34.375 --> 00:44:35.500
You see what I mean?

00:44:35.583 --> 00:44:37.333
You see that feeling I get?

00:44:37.416 --> 00:44:39.458
She's just...
She's shy, that's all.

00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:41.000
She... She don't mean nothing.

00:44:41.083 --> 00:44:44.125
Sometimes,
when the parents get divorced,

00:44:44.208 --> 00:44:47.000
the kids get all confused,
and then they get resentful

00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:48.875
and they don't know who to take it out on,

00:44:48.958 --> 00:44:50.416
or, you know, which side, or...

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.458
No, you're right.

00:44:51.541 --> 00:44:53.583
I'm lucky in that way because

00:44:53.666 --> 00:44:56.666
Reenie and Mary,
they get along like gangbusters,

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.375
so the kids go back and forth
with no problem.

00:44:59.458 --> 00:45:01.375
Keep your family close.
Keep an eye on that.

00:45:01.458 --> 00:45:03.333
Anyway, I'm just telling you, you know.

00:45:03.416 --> 00:45:05.625
I mean, I'm... I'm just lucky.

00:45:06.541 --> 00:45:07.708
Yeah.

00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:12.375
How's it going with the union?

00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:13.958
The union's the best in the world.

00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:15.833
- You like it, huh?
- Yeah, well, it's just...

00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:19.083
I mean, I wish I had something
more steady, but...

00:45:19.166 --> 00:45:20.333
Yeah, it's...

00:45:20.416 --> 00:45:22.583
- How about organizing?
- Yeah.

00:45:22.666 --> 00:45:24.375
- I would like to do that. But...
- Yeah?

00:45:24.458 --> 00:45:26.208
There's a long line.

00:45:26.291 --> 00:45:28.375
- A long waiting list, if you will.
- Yeah.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.875
Well, a friend of ours
is having a little trouble.

00:45:32.958 --> 00:45:35.208
- Friend at the top.
- Who's that?

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.041
The top.

00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:38.458
Hoffa?

00:45:38.541 --> 00:45:39.416
Yeah.

00:45:40.416 --> 00:45:42.208
I heard the other day

00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:44.833
that some guys
tried to pipe him because of

00:45:44.916 --> 00:45:46.416
- a workman's comp case.
- Yeah.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.250
Yeah, I heard
he beat the shit out of them.

00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:51.125
Yeah, but how long
is he gonna keep doing that?

00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:52.291
Things are gonna keep happening.

00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:54.500
He needs somebody
he can trust around him.

00:45:54.583 --> 00:45:56.625
Somebody to be with him all the time.

00:45:56.708 --> 00:45:57.750
Yeah.

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:02.750
<i>Let me put McGee on the phone.</i>

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.958
Hello.

00:46:06.958 --> 00:46:08.708
Hiya, my friend. How are you?

00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:12.875
Listen, I got that kid
I was talking to you about here.

00:46:12.958 --> 00:46:16.041
I'm gonna put him on the phone,
let you talk to him, okay?

00:46:16.125 --> 00:46:17.166
All right.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:20.458
Hello.

00:46:20.541 --> 00:46:22.041
- Is that Frank?
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:46:22.125 --> 00:46:24.250
Hiya, Frank. This is Jimmy Hoffa.

00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:25.875
Yeah, yeah. Glad to meet you.

00:46:25.958 --> 00:46:28.958
Well, glad to meet you, too,
even if it's over the phone.

00:46:30.791 --> 00:46:32.666
I heard you paint houses.

00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:35.791
Yes. Yes, sir, I... I do. I do.

00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:37.041
And I, uh...

00:46:37.125 --> 00:46:39.000
I also do my own carpentry.

00:46:39.083 --> 00:46:40.916
<i>Oh! I'm glad to hear that.</i>

00:46:41.666 --> 00:46:43.375
I understand you're a brother of mine.

00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:46.625
Yes, sir. Local 107. Since 1947.

00:46:46.708 --> 00:46:48.458
<i>Yeah! You know, uh,</i>

00:46:48.541 --> 00:46:50.375
our friend speaks very highly of you.

00:46:50.458 --> 00:46:52.583
Well, thank you.

00:46:52.666 --> 00:46:56.333
- He's not an easy man to please.
- Well, I do my best.

00:46:56.416 --> 00:46:57.958
<i>Well, you know, there's a situation...</i>

00:46:58.041 --> 00:47:02.250
<i>Nowadays, young people,</i>
<i>they don't know who Jimmy Hoffa was.</i>

00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:04.083
<i>They don't have a clue.</i>

00:47:04.166 --> 00:47:06.875
<i>I mean, maybe they know
that he disappeared or something,</i>

00:47:06.958 --> 00:47:08.791
<i>but that's about it.</i>

00:47:08.875 --> 00:47:10.791
<i>But back then, there wasn't nobody</i>

00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:14.375
<i>in this country who didn't know
who Jimmy Hoffa was.</i>

00:47:14.458 --> 00:47:15.666
- God bless, Jimmy.
- Oh!

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.708
Everything you've done,
you're a real gentleman.

00:47:17.791 --> 00:47:18.958
That's good.

00:47:19.041 --> 00:47:22.166
<i>In the '50s,</i>
<i>he was as big as Elvis.</i>

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.833
<i>In the '60s, he was like the Beatles.</i>

00:47:25.416 --> 00:47:26.541
<i>Next to the president, he was like</i>

00:47:26.625 --> 00:47:29.333
<i>the most powerful man in the country.
Bar none.</i>

00:47:29.416 --> 00:47:31.166
If you got it,

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.458
a truck brought it to you.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.125
If you got your food, your clothing,

00:47:38.208 --> 00:47:41.375
your medicine,
if you got fuel for your homes,

00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:43.291
fuel for your industries,

00:47:44.083 --> 00:47:46.041
a truck brought it to them!

00:47:48.208 --> 00:47:51.250
The day our trucks stop,

00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:52.958
America stops!

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:57.166
<i>Well, there's a situation</i>

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.083
<i>going on now, Frank,
that needs to be attended to.</i>

00:48:00.166 --> 00:48:02.250
You know,
they're trying to tear the union apart.

00:48:02.958 --> 00:48:06.375
Big business and the government
working together, trying to pull us down.

00:48:06.458 --> 00:48:08.333
<i>Big business</i>
<i>is on the attack!</i>

00:48:08.416 --> 00:48:10.666
They're coming! They're coming hard

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:12.041
and they're coming fast!

00:48:12.125 --> 00:48:16.458
Big business and the government
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent

00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:18.250
among our ranks,

00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:21.750
at a time when we need unity!

00:48:21.833 --> 00:48:24.000
We need solidarity!

00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:26.458
I want to write it in the sky.

00:48:27.125 --> 00:48:28.458
Solidarity!

00:48:29.625 --> 00:48:31.166
Solidarity!

00:48:32.625 --> 00:48:34.125
Solidarity!

00:48:34.208 --> 00:48:36.291
<i>You wanna be</i>
<i>a part of this fight?</i>

00:48:36.375 --> 00:48:37.666
Yes, I do, sir.

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.291
<i>Would you like to be
a part of this history?</i>

00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:41.458
Yes, I would.

00:48:42.291 --> 00:48:45.000
Whatever you need me to do,
I'm available.

00:48:45.083 --> 00:48:46.666
Can you come to Chicago tomorrow?

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:47.958
Yes, I can, sir.

00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:49.166
<i>All right, then. See you then.</i>

00:48:54.166 --> 00:48:56.583
- He likes to talk, don't he?
- Yeah.

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.458
Thought I was talking to General Patton.

00:49:08.083 --> 00:49:11.416
<i>You know, Frank,</i>
<i>the only reason why you're here,</i>

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.375
<i>the Seafarers Union,
they're signing up</i>

00:49:13.458 --> 00:49:16.166
<i>the same non-union cab drivers</i>

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:17.791
<i>as we want to do.</i>

00:49:17.875 --> 00:49:20.041
Nobody knows who you are

00:49:20.125 --> 00:49:23.333
and nobody knows
what the fuck you're doing here. Okay?

00:49:23.416 --> 00:49:25.125
- Yeah.
- You and I know why you're here.

00:49:25.208 --> 00:49:27.958
We gotta be able to sign these drivers up

00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:31.166
so Paul Hall doesn't get 'em
for his fucking union.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:33.583
For some reason, lesbians.

00:49:33.666 --> 00:49:35.583
Most of these drivers
are fucking lesbians.

00:49:35.666 --> 00:49:37.625
I have no reason why.

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:41.416
Paul Hall's running around saying
that he's gonna get a better contract

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.291
than our boy fucking Jimmy.

00:49:43.375 --> 00:49:45.541
He's a cocksucker. Yeah.

00:49:45.625 --> 00:49:49.625
Jimmy has Mayor fucking Daley
in his pocket.

00:49:49.708 --> 00:49:52.166
The cops are okay
with whatever the fuck we do.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.500
They're not gonna help us
push these cars in,

00:49:54.583 --> 00:49:57.458
but they certainly are not gonna
let anybody fucking stop us.

00:49:57.541 --> 00:49:58.416
Okay?

00:50:18.916 --> 00:50:20.875
Come on! All of you guys.
Come on!

00:50:20.958 --> 00:50:23.333
Let's get this fucking thing in there.
Watch yourself!

00:50:25.666 --> 00:50:27.833
This is a lot of work.

00:50:27.916 --> 00:50:29.291
Yeah, you ever think of using candy?

00:50:29.375 --> 00:50:31.083
- What?
- Candy.

00:50:31.166 --> 00:50:33.125
What the fuck is candy?

00:50:37.958 --> 00:50:39.958
Hey, Lou, open the fucking gate.

00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:41.708
I got it. I got it.

00:50:41.791 --> 00:50:43.833
Here, you take the gas.

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.416
Frank, there's one thing
about Jimmy.

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.250
Don't ever make him wait.

00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:06.833
If you make a meeting with him,
you get there on time.

00:51:06.916 --> 00:51:08.208
Better yet, get there early.

00:51:08.291 --> 00:51:09.833
I can't stress this enough.

00:51:09.916 --> 00:51:13.208
His problem is that time is of essence.

00:51:13.291 --> 00:51:15.125
And that's the important thing.

00:51:15.208 --> 00:51:17.541
I gotta tell you one more thing.
Jimmy doesn't drink.

00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:20.583
Yeah. The head of the largest
trucking union in the world,

00:51:20.666 --> 00:51:21.500
he don't drink.

00:51:21.583 --> 00:51:22.958
The worst part about it is,

00:51:23.041 --> 00:51:25.166
he doesn't allow anybody
to drink around him.

00:51:30.333 --> 00:51:31.833
Another thing about him,

00:51:31.916 --> 00:51:34.500
Jimmy hates fucking watermelon.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.083
But we're gonna like watermelon.

00:51:39.875 --> 00:51:41.791
Jimmy, you shoulda seen it,

00:51:41.875 --> 00:51:44.250
sinking in the water.

00:51:44.333 --> 00:51:46.708
One by one.
I bet you, when they woke up

00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:49.333
the next morning,
those fucking cab drivers,

00:51:49.416 --> 00:51:50.833
they went to look for their cabs,

00:51:50.916 --> 00:51:52.333
they didn't know what the fuck hit 'em.

00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:54.958
That's a great idea, Joey.

00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:56.250
Great idea.

00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:58.291
Well, it wasn't my idea.

00:51:58.958 --> 00:52:01.416
My man Frank. It was his idea.

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.000
Let me tell you something.

00:52:03.083 --> 00:52:05.875
Frank hit that pier,
he took over the pier.

00:52:05.958 --> 00:52:08.041
Whatever he told them to do,
whatever he said,

00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:09.291
they did it, you know.

00:52:10.583 --> 00:52:14.041
I never seen a guy walk
through a crowd like he does.

00:52:14.125 --> 00:52:15.375
He doesn't touch a fucking person!

00:52:15.458 --> 00:52:16.791
Everybody gets out of the way.

00:52:16.875 --> 00:52:18.666
I'm not kidding you. I swear.

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.083
Guys he never met in his life.
You know, it was like...

00:52:21.166 --> 00:52:23.000
like Moses. Remember Moses?

00:52:23.083 --> 00:52:25.125
When he walked into the ocean,
the sea,

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:27.250
whatever the fuck it was,
and it opened up!

00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:30.416
That's him. I'm telling you.
Jimmy, he's got it.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:31.666
So, uh, what do you think?

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:33.541
You need him
a couple of days more?

00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:36.250
Yeah, we gotta clear up
a few dribs and drabs.

00:52:38.875 --> 00:52:40.583
You guys sure like watermelon.

00:52:40.666 --> 00:52:42.166
Want a bite?

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.708
Not on your life.

00:52:45.458 --> 00:52:47.708
You were there. You saw it firsthand.

00:52:47.791 --> 00:52:49.708
Those guys ain't union.

00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:53.791
They're like Nazi collaborators,
operating behind the lines.

00:52:53.875 --> 00:52:56.500
- You know. You were in the war.
- I sure do.

00:52:56.958 --> 00:53:01.916
In a war,
you go from point A to point B.

00:53:02.666 --> 00:53:04.291
Sometimes,

00:53:04.375 --> 00:53:07.250
you spill a little beer along the way.

00:53:09.333 --> 00:53:11.000
That philosophy make sense to you?

00:53:11.083 --> 00:53:12.125
Sure does.

00:53:13.208 --> 00:53:14.291
Good.

00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:33.250
<i>Jimmy, he didn't make me</i>
<i>stay in his suite</i>

00:53:33.333 --> 00:53:34.750
<i>because he liked me.</i>

00:53:35.333 --> 00:53:37.416
<i>He made me stay with him
because he didn't want me</i>

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.708
<i>registering in my name at the hotel.</i>

00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:43.875
<i>This way, there was no proof
I was even in Chicago.</i>

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:56.041
Come on, Jimmy, you're way behind.

00:53:56.125 --> 00:53:57.666
Nothing stops her.

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:00.250
<i>After Chicago,</i>
<i>Jimmy and I got close.</i>

00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:01.500
<i>The wives hit it off.</i>

00:54:02.125 --> 00:54:03.875
<i>And with Jimmy and Josephine's kids</i>

00:54:03.958 --> 00:54:05.750
<i>mostly grown up and out of the house,</i>

00:54:05.833 --> 00:54:07.666
<i>they got a kick out of our kids too.</i>

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:09.458
Jimmy, Peggy, let's get a picture.

00:54:09.541 --> 00:54:10.791
Oh. Yes. Come on.

00:54:10.875 --> 00:54:12.250
<i>Especially Peggy.</i>

00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:15.250
<i>She and Jimmy,
they fell for each other right away.</i>

00:54:16.375 --> 00:54:19.583
You know what I like even better
than getting my picture took?

00:54:19.666 --> 00:54:20.666
What?

00:54:22.541 --> 00:54:24.250
Surprise!

00:54:24.875 --> 00:54:25.750
Peggy!

00:54:25.833 --> 00:54:27.916
<i>To Peggy, Jimmy wasn't like Russ,</i>

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.791
<i>or Skinny or even me.</i>

00:54:29.875 --> 00:54:33.083
Sorry, everybody.
This is just for Peggy and I.

00:54:33.166 --> 00:54:35.208
<i>For one thing,</i>
<i>Jimmy didn't have a nickname</i>

00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:37.625
<i>like "The Razor," or "The Hunchback,"</i>

00:54:37.708 --> 00:54:39.833
<i>or "The Weasel," or "Whispers."</i>

00:54:39.916 --> 00:54:41.833
So what happened to "Thank you"?

00:54:41.916 --> 00:54:43.416
- Thank you!
- Oh!

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.166
<i>And also, to her,</i>
<i>he was helping people.</i>

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.041
<i>He was helping them
make more money, live better lives.</i>

00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:51.875
<i>He wasn't stomping on somebody's hand.</i>

00:54:53.458 --> 00:54:55.958
"'If you have it,
a truck brought it to you."

00:54:56.041 --> 00:54:57.583
This is what Mr. Hoffa says.

00:54:57.666 --> 00:55:00.125
He's the president of the Teamsters Union

00:55:00.208 --> 00:55:02.250
with over a million members.

00:55:02.333 --> 00:55:05.208
They all support him
because they have steady jobs,

00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:07.958
great pay and a pension
for when they retire.

00:55:09.333 --> 00:55:10.958
<i>The Teamster Pension Fund</i>

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.000
<i>had eight billion dollars in it.</i>

00:55:13.083 --> 00:55:16.750
<i>And Jimmy had complete control
over every bit of it.</i>

00:55:16.833 --> 00:55:19.416
Isn't this
a beautiful presentation?

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:22.000
I mean, a bridge loan is really
all I'm asking, Jimmy.

00:55:22.583 --> 00:55:25.250
I'm not gonna piss away
my members' pension dough

00:55:25.333 --> 00:55:26.583
on something too risky.

00:55:26.666 --> 00:55:28.500
This is not a risk, Jimmy.

00:55:28.583 --> 00:55:30.833
I got Minsky's Follies.

00:55:30.916 --> 00:55:33.291
I got the first topless act on the Strip.

00:55:33.375 --> 00:55:34.791
I'm telling you, we're booming in there.

00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:35.958
I can't get the drinks out...

00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:37.666
Just asking for a golf course.

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:39.083
You know you never lost a dime with me.

00:55:39.166 --> 00:55:41.125
Jimmy, we'd really just appreciate

00:55:41.208 --> 00:55:42.833
whatever you could do
to help Jake along here.

00:55:42.916 --> 00:55:45.416
One-five is all I need
for a completion bond.

00:55:47.958 --> 00:55:50.625
Okay. Okay. Go to the bank.

00:55:50.708 --> 00:55:51.833
Thank you.

00:55:51.916 --> 00:55:52.958
It's gonna be a big success.

00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:55.000
Thank you, Jimmy. You're a prince.

00:55:55.083 --> 00:55:57.083
- You're a <i>mensch.</i>
- Yeah, I'm a <i>mensch.</i>

00:56:05.333 --> 00:56:07.666
<i>And, because of Mr. Hoffa,</i>

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:10.750
workers have medical insurance
for when they get sick,

00:56:10.833 --> 00:56:14.750
and know when they retire,
they're not going to go hungry.

00:56:16.208 --> 00:56:18.000
<i>There was</i>
<i>so much paperwork back then</i>

00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:19.916
<i>that Jimmy had to use
an insurance company</i>

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.666
<i>that was run by this kid, Allen Dorfman,
to work out the loans.</i>

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:25.166
No, no, nothing for nothing.

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:27.375
Next time,
try asking a little bit fucking nicer.

00:56:32.458 --> 00:56:34.750
And? And? How'd it go?

00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:37.416
It was a little touch and go
for a little bit.

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.041
- But at the end, fine.
- Good.

00:56:39.125 --> 00:56:40.375
<i>It was Russ who got Jimmy</i>

00:56:40.458 --> 00:56:42.208
<i>to give guys like Gottlieb the loans,</i>

00:56:42.291 --> 00:56:44.958
<i>and, you know,
he would get like 10% of that.</i>

00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:47.500
<i>Or whatever, you know. Maybe more.</i>

00:56:47.583 --> 00:56:50.916
Listen, you tell Marteduzzo
from me that I appreciate it.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.500
And everybody's gonna appreciate it.

00:56:52.583 --> 00:56:53.458
It's a good thing.

00:56:53.541 --> 00:56:54.500
Okay. I'll do that.

00:56:54.583 --> 00:56:56.541
<i>Back then,</i>
<i>you couldn't go to regular banks</i>

00:56:56.625 --> 00:56:58.291
<i>because the money was for gambling.</i>

00:56:58.375 --> 00:57:00.958
<i>God's truth, that's what it was.
I'm serious. You couldn't.</i>

00:57:01.041 --> 00:57:02.833
<i>So the Mob, what did they do?</i>

00:57:02.916 --> 00:57:04.708
<i>They went to the Teamsters
for the money.</i>

00:57:04.791 --> 00:57:06.583
<i>It was the Teamsters that stepped in</i>

00:57:06.666 --> 00:57:08.541
<i>and lent the money that built Las Vegas.</i>

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:10.375
- This is the mahogany...
- Don't, Billy.

00:57:10.458 --> 00:57:11.708
- Don't touch the stuff.
- I won't.

00:57:11.791 --> 00:57:13.250
- Just go where you gotta go.
- Okay.

00:57:13.333 --> 00:57:15.916
<i>There was more business</i>
<i>than anybody could handle.</i>

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.291
<i>So Jimmy had to shove
some of the deals</i>

00:57:18.375 --> 00:57:19.916
<i>off on to his wife Jo,</i>

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.166
<i>who had no idea she had 22%</i>

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.916
<i>of a Florida land deal
called "Sun Valley,"</i>

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.625
<i>some charter fishing boats,</i>

00:57:26.708 --> 00:57:28.916
<i>and a ski lodge with its own mountain.</i>

00:57:34.041 --> 00:57:37.583
<i>One of Jimmy's clients
was Sam "Momo" Giancana,</i>

00:57:37.666 --> 00:57:40.208
<i>who was friends with the Kennedys
from back when Jack's father</i>

00:57:40.291 --> 00:57:42.166
<i>made his fortune with the Italians</i>

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.333
<i>as a bootlegger during Prohibition.</i>

00:57:44.416 --> 00:57:48.083
<i>Momo, Sinatra hung out together
with the Kennedys.</i>

00:57:49.083 --> 00:57:51.208
Momo and Kennedy,

00:57:51.291 --> 00:57:53.625
believe it or not,
even had the same girlfriend.

00:57:53.708 --> 00:57:55.750
Together. At the same time.

00:57:56.291 --> 00:57:57.416
Talk about crazy.

00:57:58.291 --> 00:58:00.458
<i>So it was easy for the Mob
to help Joe Kennedy</i>

00:58:00.541 --> 00:58:03.041
<i>get his son elected president.
That was easy.</i>

00:58:03.666 --> 00:58:05.500
<i>They just punched up the vote a little</i>

00:58:05.583 --> 00:58:08.041
<i>to make sure that he won in Illinois.</i>

00:58:11.625 --> 00:58:13.291
<i>In exchange for that,</i>

00:58:13.375 --> 00:58:16.666
the new president was supposedly
gonna get Castro out of Cuba

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:19.333
so our guys could get their casinos back,

00:58:19.416 --> 00:58:21.416
and race tracks, and shrimp boats,

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.833
and everything else that they had,

00:58:22.916 --> 00:58:25.291
and owned down there from Havana back.

00:58:25.375 --> 00:58:27.291
But that... that didn't happen.

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.333
<i>The Italians wanted Kennedy
the Irishman for president,</i>

00:58:38.416 --> 00:58:40.375
<i>and that's what they got.</i>

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.250
Get used to it,
because we're gonna be seeing it 24/7.

00:58:45.333 --> 00:58:46.875
Son of a bitch!

00:58:46.958 --> 00:58:48.000
Goddamn Kennedys.

00:58:48.083 --> 00:58:49.458
I'm looking at the goddamn Kennedys.

00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:51.500
Jimmy, the kids. Language.

00:58:51.583 --> 00:58:53.458
Oh, what difference does it make?

00:58:53.541 --> 00:58:55.125
I mean, they gotta learn sooner or later.

00:58:55.208 --> 00:58:56.958
We're going to war with these people.

00:58:57.041 --> 00:58:58.166
War!

00:58:59.083 --> 00:59:00.958
If I said it once,
I said it a thousand times,

00:59:01.041 --> 00:59:02.791
I don't care they're Irish.

00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:05.000
I don't care they're Catholic.

00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:08.458
If there's one person
you can't trust in this life,

00:59:08.541 --> 00:59:10.041
it's millionaires' kids.

00:59:10.125 --> 00:59:11.916
You're right, Jimmy.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.625
Especially that little son of a bitch.

00:59:16.958 --> 00:59:18.375
Are you saying you don't remember

00:59:18.458 --> 00:59:20.458
doing any favors for Johnny Dio,

00:59:20.541 --> 00:59:22.416
or you don't remember
the conversation?

00:59:23.666 --> 00:59:26.875
I'm saying,
to the best of my recollection,

00:59:27.458 --> 00:59:29.875
I must recall on my memory,

00:59:29.958 --> 00:59:31.833
I cannot remember.

00:59:34.208 --> 00:59:36.958
Then where did this $20,000 come from?

00:59:38.791 --> 00:59:40.000
Individuals.

00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:42.833
Which individuals, Mr. Hoffa?

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:44.708
Uh...

00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:50.166
Off hand, that particular amount of money
I borrowed,

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:52.750
I don't know at this particular moment.

00:59:53.666 --> 00:59:58.500
But the record of my loans,
which I requested, I have,

00:59:58.583 --> 01:00:00.875
and out of all the moneys I loaned

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:04.833
during this period of time
I went into these ventures.

01:00:10.875 --> 01:00:12.375
<i>Those goddamn Kennedys,</i>

01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:13.875
they get what they want!

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:15.000
Jimmy. Jimmy, the kids.

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.833
Him and all the bullshit problems

01:00:16.916 --> 01:00:18.708
- he put me through already.
- Jimmy.

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:20.916
I gotta go.
You don't expect me to look at this.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.375
No, I don't.

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:24.791
- Whoa!
<i>- For guys like Russ,</i>

01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:26.291
<i>it couldn't have been better.</i>

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:27.458
<i>I mean, Russ,</i>

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:30.958
<i>oh, yeah, he did his part
for getting Kennedy elected,</i>

01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:31.958
<i>that's for sure.</i>

01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:33.458
What are you doing?
I told you to put it...

01:00:33.541 --> 01:00:35.000
I told you to put them on every pole.

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:35.958
You're still walking around.

01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:37.250
<i>So what's the first thing</i>

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:40.250
<i>that Jack Kennedy does
to thank Chicago for all their help?</i>

01:00:41.166 --> 01:00:43.500
He puts his shitass brother in there,

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:44.833
<i>that little prep school punk,</i>

01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:47.333
<i>and he winds up making him
attorney general.</i>

01:00:47.416 --> 01:00:49.125
Oh!

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:52.083
And what's the first thing Bobby does?

01:00:52.166 --> 01:00:54.041
He goes after not just Jimmy,

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:56.708
which in a way you could understand.

01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:58.625
I mean, Jimmy hated the Kennedys so much

01:00:58.708 --> 01:01:01.458
he gave Nixon $500,000 in Teamster cash.

01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:04.250
But Bobby also goes after Giancana,

01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:07.625
Marcello, Trafficante,
and all the other guys

01:01:07.708 --> 01:01:10.666
who put his brother in the White House
in the first place.

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:14.125
What's that about?

01:01:14.208 --> 01:01:15.291
Frank.

01:01:15.375 --> 01:01:17.041
- Oh, thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:18.250
Am I missing something?

01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:20.291
Thank you, Carrie.

01:01:24.375 --> 01:01:26.375
- That's gorgeous.
- Beautiful.

01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:29.958
Wear it in the best of health.
We love you.

01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:33.083
Okay, now this one is for Peggy

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:35.916
from Uncle Russell.
Merry Christmas, my love.

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.458
Oh, look at those.

01:01:40.375 --> 01:01:42.041
So nice!

01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:43.833
I heard you like to skate.

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:46.666
What do you say?

01:01:48.541 --> 01:01:49.541
Thank you.

01:01:49.625 --> 01:01:52.083
Now me and Uncle Russell
could take you ice skating.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:56.000
I think Santa Claus left you
a little something extra in there too.

01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:02.791
What do you say
to Uncle Russell?

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:06.083
What do you say?

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:08.333
Huh?

01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:09.875
Frank, it's all right.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.041
She said thank you once.
That's enough.

01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:18.958
<i>With Bobby as attorney general,</i>
<i>I mean, they were all over us.</i>

01:02:19.041 --> 01:02:21.125
<i>I mean, we couldn't talk on the phone</i>

01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:23.083
<i>because we knew it was being bugged.</i>

01:02:23.166 --> 01:02:24.916
<i>You couldn't do nothing.
You couldn't go nowhere.</i>

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.250
<i>You couldn't do anything.</i>

01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:28.625
<i>It was a bad, bad, bad situation.</i>

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:30.750
<i>And then Jimmy... Forget it.</i>

01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:33.416
<i>Bobby, now as attorney general,
he has the power</i>

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.583
<i>to send anybody to jail,
and no question about it.</i>

01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:38.125
<i>And Jimmy was at the top
of Bobby's hit list.</i>

01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:40.875
<i>He even set up
a special "Get Hoffa Squad,"</i>

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:42.791
<i>where he had his own guys from the FBI,</i>

01:02:42.875 --> 01:02:44.625
<i>the IRS working 'round the clock.</i>

01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:47.791
<i>Their only job
was to put Jimmy Hoffa in jail.</i>

01:02:47.875 --> 01:02:49.083
<i>I'm serious. That's all they did.</i>

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.041
I am sitting in a room
full of fuckin' idiots.

01:02:57.666 --> 01:03:00.125
You dumb motherfuckers!

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:01.833
You know what you did?

01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:04.333
You take Johnny O'Rourke's kid

01:03:05.041 --> 01:03:06.583
and you put him on

01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:08.875
as general organizer,

01:03:09.666 --> 01:03:12.375
pay him 36 fucking grand,

01:03:12.458 --> 01:03:14.458
at the same time,

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:19.500
you let him sell insurance
to his fucking father's...

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:30.375
to his fucking father's...

01:03:31.166 --> 01:03:34.916
to his fucking father's locals!

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Damn it!

01:03:37.666 --> 01:03:39.375
How do you do that?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.833
How stupid can you be?

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.000
That fucking cocksucker Kennedy

01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:51.541
has got his nose up my ass
everywhere I go!

01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:53.500
You don't know
that they're hounding me?

01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:55.000
They're looking at everything I do.

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:57.458
And you let this happen in public!

01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.833
You're giving it to him!

01:03:59.916 --> 01:04:01.916
I'm going to jail. You understand?

01:04:02.833 --> 01:04:04.958
I'm going to prison because of you,

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.291
you dumb motherfuckers.

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:09.750
This is what you wanted.
You wanted to put me in jail.

01:04:09.833 --> 01:04:11.708
Tell me now so I can kill you right here.

01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:12.750
Right here!

01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:19.458
Where're you going?

01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:20.458
What do you mean,
where am I going?

01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:22.041
I fucking quit, that's where I'm going.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.208
What are you quitting for?

01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:25.375
You gonna call me a motherfucker?

01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:27.375
You can talk to them like that,
you can't talk to me like that.

01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:29.583
Frank. No! That didn't apply to you.
What are you...

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:30.666
- Didn't apply?
- No!

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.208
Then you gotta let me know
it didn't apply to me.

01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:35.041
- I'm standing right there.
- I didn't even see you standing there!

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:36.625
I was standing right there, Jimmy.

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:37.875
What are you talking about?

01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:40.125
But it didn't apply to you!
What else can I say?

01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:44.416
You got a problem, you pull me aside.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.708
You don't insult me
and then you say it didn't apply to me.

01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:48.958
How am I gonna put you aside?
I didn't even see you there.

01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:51.958
Oh, come on, Frank,
you know me better than that.

01:04:52.041 --> 01:04:53.875
You just know me better than that.

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:55.166
Please.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:57.375
Come on. It's gonna be all right.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.333
It's gonna be all right. Come on.

01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:01.375
Come on, why would I ever
say anything like that to you?

01:05:01.458 --> 01:05:02.625
You gotta control these people.

01:05:02.708 --> 01:05:04.291
I'm controlling everything.
Don't worry about it.

01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:06.958
But certainly, certainly, I... you know.

01:05:07.833 --> 01:05:09.916
Come on. Okay, guys, get out of here now.

01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:13.625
<i>I mean, I don't know how</i>
<i>Jimmy is running the fucking union.</i>

01:05:13.708 --> 01:05:16.208
Between Bobby and the FBI
up his ass all the time,

01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:17.875
he's going fucking crazy.

01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:21.291
Tell Jimmy I'm sorry for his troubles.

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:23.791
The old-timers know the Old Man.
They'll talk to him.

01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:25.958
At some point,
they'll straighten it out for him.

01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:27.333
Yeah, but he can't understand,

01:05:27.416 --> 01:05:29.666
and I gotta be honest with you,
I don't understand either,

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.791
how youse could help get
those two fucking Kennedy pricks

01:05:31.875 --> 01:05:33.041
elected in the first place.

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:34.916
It don't make no sense to him,
that's for sure.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.125
He doesn't have to understand everything.

01:05:37.208 --> 01:05:39.458
You know what I'm talking about.
Sometimes it's better.

01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:40.791
Well...

01:05:40.875 --> 01:05:43.125
When I see him like that,
I don't, you know,

01:05:43.208 --> 01:05:44.750
I... I'm tryin' to... I feel bad.

01:05:44.833 --> 01:05:46.958
I wanna help him in some way.

01:05:47.041 --> 01:05:49.083
Listen, he's too emotional.

01:05:49.166 --> 01:05:51.250
Like some guy who's always
rushing, rushing

01:05:51.333 --> 01:05:54.208
all over the place
and they miss the big picture.

01:05:54.291 --> 01:05:56.250
Like Cuba.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:01.041
Getting us back into casinos.

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:03.500
Getting us back into Havana.

01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:06.583
Like getting rid
of that fucking Castro prick.

01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:12.541
The old-timers spoke to the Old Man.

01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:15.958
The Old Man talked to his son Jack,
and he told him,

01:06:16.041 --> 01:06:18.625
"Don't forget who the fuck he owes."

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:23.250
He knows who the fuck he owes.

01:06:24.666 --> 01:06:26.625
<i>So I want you</i>

01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:30.208
<i>to go down to a place
called Milestone Hauling.</i>

01:06:31.666 --> 01:06:33.875
<i>There's a guy named Phil.</i>

01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:35.833
<i>He's gonna give you a rig.</i>

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:45.583
<i>You drive the rig down to Baltimore</i>

01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:47.375
<i>to a concrete plant.</i>

01:06:47.458 --> 01:06:48.791
<i>It's on Eastern Avenue.</i>

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:51.458
<i>It's the only one on the street.
You can't miss it.</i>

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:57.458
<i>A guy's gonna meet you there.</i>

01:06:57.541 --> 01:06:59.750
<i>A fairy named Ferrie.</i>

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:03.166
Just pull it forward and then back it in.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.625
Let's go, let's go.

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:26.416
<i>You'll pick up some things.</i>

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:29.916
<i>He'll give you some paperwork
in case you get stopped.</i>

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:42.416
<i>You drive the truck down to Florida.</i>

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:45.500
<i>A dog track outside Jacksonville.</i>

01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:48.625
<i>You leave it there.</i>

01:07:49.708 --> 01:07:53.791
<i>A guy with big ears named Hunt
will meet you there.</i>

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.250
<i>He's gonna give you a car
to drive back to Philly.</i>

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:13.291
What are you looking at?

01:08:13.375 --> 01:08:14.833
You looking at my ears?

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:17.541
Sorry?

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:19.041
My ears.

01:08:19.125 --> 01:08:21.082
- Are you looking at my ears?
- Your ears?

01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:23.041
No.

01:08:24.416 --> 01:08:27.082
I had an operation,
so there's no need for anyone

01:08:27.166 --> 01:08:28.625
looking at my ears anymore.

01:08:28.707 --> 01:08:30.916
Yeah, well, I ain't looking at your ears.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:31.832
Right.

01:08:34.416 --> 01:08:36.207
Get out of here. Go on.

01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:59.291
<i>unfolded in the Bay of Pigs.</i>

01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:00.957
<i>Nothing went as planned.</i>

01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:02.375
<i>Paratroopers were unable</i>

01:09:02.457 --> 01:09:04.625
<i>to blow up roadways
leading to the beach area.</i>

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.707
<i>Castro raced toward the scene.</i>

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:09.207
<i>The underground might have blown up
the roads but it knew nothing.</i>

01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:12.082
<i>Soon, Castro had artillery
firing on the beachhead.</i>

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:13.832
<i>His planes destroyed invading ships</i>

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:16.250
<i>carrying a brigade of men
and vital ammunition.</i>

01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:18.082
<i>The beachhead could not be enlarged</i>

01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:20.625
<i>and paratroopers were soon
trying to fight their way back</i>

01:09:20.707 --> 01:09:23.832
<i>to the small section of the shore
where the invaders were pinned down.</i>

01:09:23.916 --> 01:09:26.832
<i>1,500 men had been dumped
on a shore without air cover</i>

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:28.625
<i>or protective fire from ships.</i>

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:31.207
<i>Castro had to wait
only until they ran out of ammunition</i>

01:09:31.291 --> 01:09:32.750
<i>before mopping them up.</i>

01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:36.332
<i>Later, Castro was to strut around
the invasion area with newsmen,</i>

01:09:36.416 --> 01:09:38.500
<i>and expound on the errors
that had been made.</i>

01:09:38.582 --> 01:09:40.166
<i>He had ample material.</i>

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:43.041
<i>The United States, already humiliated,</i>

01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:45.832
<i>stood condemned
by most of the countries of the world.</i>

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:46.832
<i> Ah, shit!</i>

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:49.832
Just as I predicted. They fuck up Cuba,

01:09:50.916 --> 01:09:53.082
Boobie starts coming after me
and the union.

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:55.916
He's looking for some cheap publicity.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.875
That's all it is.
That's what he's doing.

01:09:57.958 --> 01:09:59.375
Okay.
Well, it's all gonna blow over, Jimmy.

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:01.958
No, it's not gonna blow over.
How's it gonna blow over?

01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:03.875
They're never gonna forget

01:10:03.958 --> 01:10:07.250
- that I gave money to Nixon!
- Calm down. Jimmy, please.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:08.416
We're gonna handle this.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.416
Couple of the old-timers,
they're gonna get to Old Man Kennedy now.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.125
Okay? They're gonna get to him.
He's a little sick, but...

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.375
- Sick?
- Yeah. But...

01:10:14.458 --> 01:10:17.208
He had a fucking stroke.
That's not sick.

01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:19.666
That's you're...
you're close to the grave, is what.

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:21.708
He's turning into a fucking eggplant.

01:10:21.791 --> 01:10:24.000
Okay. Well, you can't blame
anybody for that. That's...

01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:25.333
I'm not looking to blame anybody.

01:10:25.416 --> 01:10:27.750
But if there's any blame going around,
it's the Kennedys.

01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:29.833
His kids killed him. Let me tell you that.

01:10:29.916 --> 01:10:32.458
He's not dead, but he's going.
He's going.

01:10:32.541 --> 01:10:35.500
They killed him.
They'd give anybody a heart attack.

01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:11.416
Where are you going?

01:11:12.416 --> 01:11:13.333
I'm going to work.

01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:15.958
Go back to sleep.

01:12:05.208 --> 01:12:08.041
<i>All I can say is that,</i>
<i>we will not stop.</i>

01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:10.500
<i>Because we've been
doing that for 50 years!</i>

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.541
<i>What good does it do?</i>

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:16.875
<i>Let the lawyers...
Let the lawyers drive a truck.</i>

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:19.833
<i>They need their pencils
and papers and their ink pads.</i>

01:12:21.666 --> 01:12:24.000
That's... That's a whole other story.

01:12:24.083 --> 01:12:25.916
But we're gonna get through this.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.916
We're gonna get through
this legal bullshit

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.375
and garbage they're throwing at us.

01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:33.833
We're gonna get through it because

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:36.625
"Boobie" Kennedy wants something,
that doesn't mean

01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:38.500
the rich boy is gonna get it.

01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:40.750
You understand what I'm saying?

01:12:40.833 --> 01:12:43.083
I don't care what he wants.
He's not gonna get it!

01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:48.625
He's not gonna get it because

01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:52.291
we are the biggest and best,

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:55.125
and most honest union

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:56.958
in this country!

01:12:57.041 --> 01:12:58.083
Yeah, that's right.

01:12:58.166 --> 01:12:59.500
I waited for that!

01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:07.958
And you know the operative word
I'm talking about here.

01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:10.125
- Solidarity.
- Yeah!

01:13:10.208 --> 01:13:12.250
And it works. It works for all of us.

01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:16.625
And it works for our friend here,
Frank Fitzsimmons!

01:13:16.708 --> 01:13:18.750
Frank Fitzsimmons here,

01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:22.041
my executive vice president.

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:25.375
If there's anyone that can do
this job, it's this man here.

01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:28.083
And with him at my back,

01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:30.166
where are we gonna go but up!

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:33.375
Is that right, Fitz?

01:13:33.458 --> 01:13:35.291
All the way, Jimmy!

01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:38.125
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:40.458
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:43.083
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

01:13:43.166 --> 01:13:45.583
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

01:13:45.666 --> 01:13:47.958
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:49.791
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:52.000
A union man!

01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:56.041
You know, I felt they liked Fitz.

01:13:56.125 --> 01:13:57.375
No two ways about it.

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:59.750
Yeah, you gave Fitz some buildup.

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:01.166
I mean, I hope he deserves it.

01:14:03.166 --> 01:14:04.958
Why? What's wrong with Fitz?

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:08.625
I don't know.
I don't want to knock the guy,

01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:09.791
but I... I don't know.

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:12.041
Well, you're not knocking him.
Just tell me...

01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.791
Tell me what you feel.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.375
I mean, he's a loyal guy, I'm sure.

01:14:17.041 --> 01:14:18.666
Uh, he's a nice guy,

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.000
but he ain't that sharp.
He ain't that smart.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:22.208
And he's also like a...

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.208
He plays a lot of fucking golf,
you know.

01:14:24.291 --> 01:14:25.416
He plays golf?

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:28.291
So what?
That's what you want from a number two.

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:30.375
You don't want somebody too smart.

01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:33.583
You want a nice guy.
People like him, you know.

01:14:33.666 --> 01:14:35.541
Not dumb, but somebody,

01:14:35.625 --> 01:14:37.000
you know you can have
walking behind you

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:39.083
without getting knifed.

01:14:39.166 --> 01:14:41.791
- Well, I hope you're right.
- I'm always right.

01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:44.833
I can sleep like a babe with Fitz.

01:14:46.375 --> 01:14:48.583
It's the Little Guy I have to worry about.

01:14:48.666 --> 01:14:50.208
You know what I'm saying.

01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:51.250
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:52.416
The Little Guy.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.875
- That's my worry.
- Yeah.

01:14:55.541 --> 01:14:56.916
That son of a bitch.

01:14:58.541 --> 01:14:59.458
What's the matter?

01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:01.458
Nothing. Nothing. You're right.

01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:03.458
I'm right. Yeah.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.208
- You're not perplexed, are you?
- Not at all. Not at all.

01:15:06.291 --> 01:15:09.791
I mean, I told you how I felt about Fitz.
Pro. You know.

01:15:09.875 --> 01:15:11.500
Yeah. Good, because sometimes I feel

01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:14.541

have dedicated themselves
to our destruction.

01:16:39.958 --> 01:16:41.833
Down on them!

01:16:42.875 --> 01:16:45.666
<i>I didn't need nobody</i>
<i>to tell me about Tony Pro.</i>

01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:48.458
<i>Oh, no. What did I need to know?
I knew enough.</i>

01:16:55.458 --> 01:16:58.166
<i>This is a man
who had Sally Bugs strangle</i>

01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:00.333
<i>Tony "Three Fingers" Castellito</i>

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:04.041
<i>just because Three Fingers
was coming up big in the union.</i>

01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:06.458
<i>And it was his own guy.
It was his own guy.</i>

01:17:23.833 --> 01:17:25.875
<i>Tony Pro was so fucking worried</i>

01:17:25.958 --> 01:17:27.500
<i>that this guy was gonna beat him out</i>

01:17:27.583 --> 01:17:29.958
<i>that after he had Sally Bugs
strangle the guy,</i>

01:17:30.041 --> 01:17:33.000
<i>he had Sally stick him
in a fucking tree shredder.</i>

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:34.750
<i>That way there'd be no competition,</i>

01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:36.000
<i>not even from the grave.</i>

01:17:36.083 --> 01:17:37.458
<i>He's out of control.</i>

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.958
What are you gonna do
with a person like this?

01:17:40.708 --> 01:17:42.750
He's got a hand in everybody's pocket.

01:17:42.833 --> 01:17:44.333
Shaking down the trucking companies.

01:17:44.416 --> 01:17:45.583
Can you imagine that?

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:46.958
Threatening people.

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:49.583
I mean, you know,
threatening people once in a while,

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:51.083
okay, I understand.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.291
But all the time?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.708
It's drawing attention to us,
you understand?

01:17:56.208 --> 01:17:59.041
Guys like that
give the unions a bad name.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.916
Something's got to be done.

01:18:02.625 --> 01:18:05.208
I mean it.
Something's gotta be done.

01:18:05.916 --> 01:18:07.875
Tony being Tony, uh...

01:18:08.791 --> 01:18:10.458
that ain't... that ain't easy.
We can't...

01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:12.791
I don't mean that. I don't...

01:18:12.875 --> 01:18:14.166
Not... Not that.

01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:15.666
Yeah, I'm just...

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:17.375
I'm just saying get working guys

01:18:17.458 --> 01:18:19.958
who know the unions,
card-carrying Teamsters,

01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:21.416
like you and me.

01:18:22.083 --> 01:18:23.333
Start running,

01:18:23.416 --> 01:18:24.916
take over some of the locals.

01:18:25.625 --> 01:18:27.333
What do you think?

01:18:27.416 --> 01:18:28.916
- He ain't gonna like that.
- Who?

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.125
Fuck him. Who the fuck is he?

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:32.500
He's a gangster.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.666
I run the union, I'm the president.

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:36.125
So, I mean...

01:18:36.208 --> 01:18:39.583
All I need is some guys
who know their ways around.

01:18:40.291 --> 01:18:41.958
Know how to handle themselves, you know.

01:18:42.041 --> 01:18:43.041
That's all.

01:18:44.125 --> 01:18:46.625
That's why I want you to run for president

01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:48.208
of Local 326.

01:18:51.083 --> 01:18:53.708
You're like family to me, Frank.
You know.

01:18:53.791 --> 01:18:55.083
You, Irene,

01:18:55.666 --> 01:18:56.791
the girls.

01:18:56.875 --> 01:18:57.875
The lovely Peggy.

01:18:58.958 --> 01:19:01.000
But that's not why I'm doing this.

01:19:01.083 --> 01:19:03.583
I'm not giving you anything
you didn't earn,

01:19:04.541 --> 01:19:05.583
you didn't deserve.

01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:07.958
What do you think?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.083
Um, I... I don't know what to say, Jimmy.

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:15.333
- I mean, um...
- Well, just say you'll do it.

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:17.750
That's all you got to say.

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:20.166
Plus, I can guarantee you're gonna win.

01:19:21.333 --> 01:19:23.166
Ha! When you run for president

01:19:24.291 --> 01:19:26.708
of 326, you're gonna win.

01:19:28.208 --> 01:19:29.333
I guarantee it.

01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:32.291
Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Yeah.

01:19:33.958 --> 01:19:35.041
You mean it, huh?

01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:37.333
Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm honored.

01:19:37.416 --> 01:19:40.166
I love you. I just love you, you know.
Come here.

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:41.833
I love you, man.

01:19:41.916 --> 01:19:43.458
I can't tell ya.

01:19:43.541 --> 01:19:44.416
Oh, gee.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.125
Oh, this is so good, you know.

01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:48.416
I feel like I can breathe again.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.041
It's so funny. I...

01:19:50.125 --> 01:19:51.208
Somehow I...

01:19:52.416 --> 01:19:54.666
I don't know.
I thought you would've said no.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:58.250
- Oh, um...
- I'm glad you said yes.

01:19:58.333 --> 01:19:59.208
I mean...

01:20:00.583 --> 01:20:01.625
Frank...

01:20:03.541 --> 01:20:06.625
You never reveal how you feel, you know.
It's hard to tell.

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:08.833
I'm honored, Jimmy. I don't know...

01:20:08.916 --> 01:20:10.916
It's just I don't know what to... say,

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.250
you know, but I'm honored.

01:20:13.541 --> 01:20:14.791
Well, that's good.

01:20:16.625 --> 01:20:18.125
That makes me feel good.

01:20:19.458 --> 01:20:20.958
Oh, I can breathe.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.416
That's so great.

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:26.208
I...

01:20:54.666 --> 01:20:57.625
<i>What can I say?</i>
<i>I mean, I owe it all to Jimmy.</i>

01:20:57.708 --> 01:21:01.041
<i>He took me out of a meat truck,
he gave me my start.</i>

01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:04.750
<i>He gave me my first charter.
He gave me my first union.</i>

01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:07.375
- How are ya?
- Hey, how are you?

01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:09.750
Frank Sheeran,
the new president of Union 326.

01:21:09.833 --> 01:21:12.291
- I wanted to introduce myself.
- Nice to meet ya.

01:21:12.916 --> 01:21:14.541
- What's your name?
- My name's Al.

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:16.375
Al. Nice to meet ya, Al.

01:21:16.458 --> 01:21:18.333
- A little something...
- No, no. Don't need it.

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:20.250
- Sure?
- Yeah.

01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:21.791
Just came here to say hello,
introduce myself.

01:21:21.875 --> 01:21:23.666
You need anything,
just get in touch with me.

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:24.750
- Okay? Yeah.
- You sure?

01:21:24.833 --> 01:21:25.791
Thank you.

01:21:25.875 --> 01:21:28.041
So, hypothetically,
if they can prove

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:29.041
that you stole from them,

01:21:29.125 --> 01:21:31.833
what they're gonna want are names, so...

01:21:33.583 --> 01:21:36.833
Would you be willing to give up names
to keep from going to jail?

01:21:37.458 --> 01:21:38.291
No.

01:21:38.375 --> 01:21:41.041
Okay. So you got nothing to worry about.

01:21:41.125 --> 01:21:44.500
- The lawyers will take care of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Sheeran.

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:57.708
<i>The Interstate 80 West</i>
<i>through the rest of Pennsylvania,</i>

01:21:58.208 --> 01:22:02.500
<i>and then we'd go across Ohio
all the way to Toledo,</i>

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:06.125
<i>and then we'd go 75 North to Detroit.</i>

01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:09.250
<i>And we'd still get there on time.</i>

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:14.458
<i>Your Honor,</i>
<i>my client had been advised by counsel</i>

01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:16.791
that it was perfectly legal for his wife

01:22:16.875 --> 01:22:19.041
to be part owner of a trucking business.

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:22.291
Still, when the McClellan Committee
challenged its legality,

01:22:22.375 --> 01:22:24.666
she withdrew from the company
immediately.

01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:26.916
That should be the end of the matter.

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.708
There had been not one indictment served

01:22:29.791 --> 01:22:33.041
against my client
in 13 grand jury investigations.

01:22:33.875 --> 01:22:36.750
Your Honor, this is an example of

01:22:36.833 --> 01:22:39.041
a personal vendetta against my client,

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:42.708
against his family,
by a frustrated Justice Department

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.833
and the attorney general, Robert Kennedy.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.166
Whoa!

01:22:51.791 --> 01:22:53.083
He's got a gun!

01:22:53.791 --> 01:22:54.666
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:22:58.166 --> 01:22:59.333
Get that gun out of his hand!

01:23:03.166 --> 01:23:04.208
Easy, boy.

01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:11.625
That was not a real gun, was it?

01:23:11.708 --> 01:23:13.166
How'd that gun get in?

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:14.375
How'd it get in here?

01:23:14.458 --> 01:23:16.041
It wasn't my fault!

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:17.333
I don't know!

01:23:17.416 --> 01:23:18.500
Oh, my Chuckie!

01:23:18.583 --> 01:23:20.791
Hey, it's my son!

01:23:20.875 --> 01:23:23.083
That's my kid. I raised this kid.

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:24.916
You see him? You see what he did?

01:23:27.541 --> 01:23:28.625
I'll tell you this.

01:23:28.708 --> 01:23:31.791
He shot at me,
and it was like a pellet or something.

01:23:31.875 --> 01:23:33.958
I didn't feel it,
I just felt a little impact,

01:23:34.041 --> 01:23:36.291
like I was shot not even with a BB gun.

01:23:36.375 --> 01:23:38.125
Something even lighter.

01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:39.375
But I charged him.

01:23:39.458 --> 01:23:41.083
I charged him and so did Chuckie,
if you noticed.

01:23:41.166 --> 01:23:42.083
I taught him well.

01:23:42.666 --> 01:23:46.166
You charge a guy,
always charge a guy with a gun.

01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:47.625
With a knife, you run away.

01:23:47.708 --> 01:23:51.083
Run away from a knife.
So you charge with a gun,

01:23:51.166 --> 01:23:52.750
- with a knife, you run.
- That's right.

01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:54.875
Hey! I rhymed!

01:23:56.666 --> 01:23:59.000
I know it sounds crazy,
but I got a message from a higher power

01:23:59.083 --> 01:24:00.208
telling me to shoot Jimmy Hoffa.

01:24:00.291 --> 01:24:01.166
Come with me.

01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:03.333
A lot of nuts in Nashville, Frank.

01:24:03.416 --> 01:24:05.291
Come on down, Frank.

01:24:05.375 --> 01:24:07.208
Yeah, I got one of them
with me now, you see.

01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:08.541
<i>Get down here, Frank.</i>

01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:10.541
<i>Eddie Partin, you know the guy
from Baton Rouge,</i>

01:24:10.625 --> 01:24:11.541
<i>he's here with me.</i>

01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:12.791
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get right down.

01:24:12.875 --> 01:24:14.625
Out of my way, boys. Come on.

01:24:16.125 --> 01:24:17.333
Come on, come on.

01:24:20.958 --> 01:24:22.250
Hey.

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:24.000
Did Mr. Brennan first say,

01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:25.583
or do you remember him first saying

01:24:25.666 --> 01:24:28.625
something about, say,
"I had to change the deal.

01:24:28.708 --> 01:24:30.833
I have to cut Hoffa in on the new deal"?

01:24:30.916 --> 01:24:33.833
Wasn't that like the chronology
of the whole thing?

01:24:33.916 --> 01:24:36.250
I don't know he changed the deal,

01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:39.541
but it was my understanding
over the telephone that Brennan

01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:41.083
was speaking for himself.

01:24:41.166 --> 01:24:42.833
<i>She's an angry woman.</i>
<i>That's an angry woman.</i>

01:24:42.916 --> 01:24:43.958
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:46.291
- She was a teacher I think.
- Oh, that's right.

01:24:46.375 --> 01:24:48.000
What we're looking at
is this one.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:49.375
This one is not approachable.

01:24:49.458 --> 01:24:50.958
No, she'd be
a tough nut to crack.

01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:52.458
There's a lot
of family money there.

01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:54.166
<i>...will hail,</i>
<i>stop, and search</i>

01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:56.166
<i>all ships bound for Cuba.</i>

01:24:56.250 --> 01:24:58.083
<i>If the ships' captains do not stop,</i>

01:24:58.166 --> 01:24:59.833
<i>force will be used to stop them.</i>

01:24:59.916 --> 01:25:01.375
<i>If the ships do stop...</i>

01:25:01.458 --> 01:25:03.541
See, I think there's an in here...

01:25:03.625 --> 01:25:06.583
Did you make this statement
to the grand jury? I'll read it for you.

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:09.791
"Brennan came to me and said words
to the effect he's gonna go ahead..."

01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:11.541
<i>He's got a restaurant.</i>

01:25:11.625 --> 01:25:12.541
Did you look into violations?

01:25:12.625 --> 01:25:14.041
Yeah.
I'd rather stick with the women.

01:25:14.125 --> 01:25:16.458
- They're more approachable.
- Jimmy, thank you.

01:25:16.541 --> 01:25:19.666
<i>...in Cuba of operational</i>
<i>medium-range missiles.</i>

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:21.791
<i>He added that if one
of the missiles is launched,</i>

01:25:21.875 --> 01:25:23.875
<i>it would probably carry a nuclear warhead.</i>

01:25:24.541 --> 01:25:27.375
<i>It could hit any spot
in the southeast United States,</i>

01:25:27.458 --> 01:25:28.791
<i>south of Washington.</i>

01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:31.458
<i>And that we would have no way

01:25:31.541 --> 01:25:33.500
<i>or issuing a warning about it.</i>

01:25:33.583 --> 01:25:36.541
This one's married
to a state trooper named Plechette.

01:25:36.625 --> 01:25:37.875
Ooh, that's good.

01:25:38.708 --> 01:25:39.791
We know anyone?

01:25:39.875 --> 01:25:43.375
Well, yeah,
we got an ex-cop in the Local.

01:25:43.458 --> 01:25:44.583
That's good.

01:25:44.666 --> 01:25:46.916
<i>All our forces
have been put on increased alert.</i>

01:26:08.625 --> 01:26:10.291
<i>...came to me</i>
<i>and said words to the effect</i>

01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:13.333
<i>he's gonna go ahead
and set up a company to lease trucks.</i>

01:26:13.416 --> 01:26:16.333
But later, he called me
on the phone and said quote,

01:26:16.416 --> 01:26:20.583
"I gotta change the deal
'cause I gotta cut Hoffa in on the deal."

01:26:20.666 --> 01:26:21.875
Is that accurate, sir?

01:26:21.958 --> 01:26:23.791
This one's another possibility.

01:26:23.875 --> 01:26:25.875
- Wait.
- Well, she had a boyfriend,

01:26:25.958 --> 01:26:28.250
she's seeing somebody else
while she's married.

01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:30.625
So it could be... It could grab her,

01:26:30.708 --> 01:26:31.750
- hold on to her.
- Yeah, but...

01:26:31.833 --> 01:26:33.083
But this guy,

01:26:33.166 --> 01:26:36.041
the construction business.
He has a couple of violations,

01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:38.583
there's a lien on his house.

01:26:38.666 --> 01:26:40.083
His car is unpaid.

01:26:40.875 --> 01:26:44.000
That's good. Keep going.
Don't quit while you're ahead.

01:26:51.125 --> 01:26:52.958
Thank you. See you, Big Eddie.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:56.083
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

01:26:56.166 --> 01:26:58.291
- so help you God?
- I do.

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:08.500
Mr. King, you're a member of

01:27:08.583 --> 01:27:11.833
the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, is that correct, sir?

01:27:11.916 --> 01:27:15.458
I respectfully decline
to answer that under the, uh,

01:27:15.541 --> 01:27:18.291
protection afforded me by the...

01:27:18.375 --> 01:27:19.500
Fifth Amendment.

01:27:19.583 --> 01:27:21.125
I just asked if you're a Teamster, sir.

01:27:21.208 --> 01:27:22.875
I respectfully decline to answer...

01:27:22.958 --> 01:27:24.750
Okay. All right. Fine.

01:27:24.833 --> 01:27:26.750
I'm gonna show you
a photograph, all right?

01:27:26.833 --> 01:27:29.375
- I respectfully decline to answer...
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait...

01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:30.416
under the protection...

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.666
You haven't even seen the photograph yet.

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:34.625
Look at the photograph, wait a smidge,

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:37.625
- and then you can...
- I want to avail myself

01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:41.916
of my right under the constitution,
as I understand it.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.916
- Jim, let him avail himself.
- Oh, okay.

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:54.041
- Oh, yeah.
- Mmm.

01:27:54.125 --> 01:27:55.958
That King's the best.

01:27:56.041 --> 01:27:58.500
He's the best. He's a good guy.

01:27:58.583 --> 01:28:00.125
You see him stand up to that jerk?

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:02.083
Yeah, yeah, I know.
He was great.

01:28:02.166 --> 01:28:03.750
I love what he did.

01:28:03.833 --> 01:28:05.916
They tried to get him,
they tried their best.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.875
- We need more like him.
- Oh, my God!

<i>Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly</i>

01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:37.500
<i>and become the 36th
President of the United States.</i>

01:29:44.166 --> 01:29:45.583
Mr. Hoffa,
will you be attending

01:29:45.666 --> 01:29:47.458
the President's funeral?

01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:48.458
I wasn't invited.

01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:51.125
You don't have to be invited.
A million Americans will be there.

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:52.458
Well...

01:29:52.541 --> 01:29:54.291
I guess I'll have to check my schedule.

01:29:54.375 --> 01:29:57.250
If you were to go and asked to speak,
what would you say?

01:29:57.333 --> 01:29:58.791
I'd say, uh,

01:29:58.875 --> 01:30:01.208
Bobby Kennedy is just another lawyer now.

01:30:06.291 --> 01:30:07.750
Son of a bitch.

01:30:23.375 --> 01:30:24.750
Good, Eric. Thank you very much.

01:30:35.166 --> 01:30:36.666
<i>Jimmy was right.</i>

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
<i>Almost.</i>

01:30:40.666 --> 01:30:42.708
<i>That was the end of it with Bobby.</i>

01:30:43.625 --> 01:30:46.708
<i>So much for him being
the attorney general. That was done.</i>

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.958
<i>Bobby's vendetta was over, with us.</i>

01:30:58.458 --> 01:30:59.958
Mr. Hoffa,

01:31:00.916 --> 01:31:03.000
you stand here convicted
of having tampered

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:05.458
with the very soul of this nation.

01:31:05.541 --> 01:31:09.125
<i>But there was still</i>
<i>that jury thing in Nashville.</i>

01:31:09.208 --> 01:31:11.333
The soul of this nation, sir,

01:31:11.416 --> 01:31:14.125
lies in its sacred processes of justice.

01:31:14.666 --> 01:31:16.375
Justice must be done.

01:31:16.458 --> 01:31:19.916
And for your wicked attempts
to corrupt these processes,

01:31:21.208 --> 01:31:23.583
justice will be done on you.

01:31:23.666 --> 01:31:26.041
We got him now.

01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:27.041
We got him.

01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:30.375
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it!

01:31:47.666 --> 01:31:50.416
<i>But Jimmy, you know,</i>
<i>he had it all set up.</i>

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:53.708
<i>Although you knew
it was supposed to look like Fitz</i>

01:31:53.791 --> 01:31:55.666
<i>was the one in charge.</i>

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:59.041
<i>He gave Fitz his orders
through Bill Bufalino and Allen Dorfman,</i>

01:31:59.125 --> 01:32:00.583
<i>and they ran Jimmy's loans.</i>

01:32:00.666 --> 01:32:03.083
But things are good in here?
Everything is...

01:32:03.166 --> 01:32:04.291
Everything's terrible.

01:32:04.375 --> 01:32:05.875
You don't sleep at night
'cause you're afraid

01:32:05.958 --> 01:32:07.666
someone's gonna knife you.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.375
'Cause you look okay. You look okay.

01:32:09.458 --> 01:32:11.791
Where's Fitz? He's late.

01:32:11.875 --> 01:32:14.708
Yeah. Well, we were gonna meet him
in the front. He...

01:32:14.791 --> 01:32:15.875
Meet him in the front?

01:32:15.958 --> 01:32:16.875
Here he is, here he is.

01:32:16.958 --> 01:32:19.541
Where the hell have you been?
What are you doing here?

01:32:19.625 --> 01:32:21.083
Why did you even come at all, Fitz?

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:23.000
You know, are you aware you're late?

01:32:23.083 --> 01:32:24.833
That's all I want to know.
Do you know you're late?

01:32:24.916 --> 01:32:27.875
I'm sorry I'm late, Jimmy,
but we got a lot going on.

01:32:27.958 --> 01:32:30.541
I don't wanna hear that.
I wanna hear something concrete,

01:32:30.625 --> 01:32:32.583
I wanna hear something straight on.

01:32:32.666 --> 01:32:35.250
Uh, I'm just gonna ask you
to be a little more patient.

01:32:35.333 --> 01:32:36.583
I think we're gonna have...

01:32:36.666 --> 01:32:38.291
I'm inside here.
I'm not gonna be too patient.

01:32:38.958 --> 01:32:42.125
<i>As much as Jimmy</i>
<i>was getting pissed off at Fitz,</i>

01:32:42.208 --> 01:32:44.208
<i>everybody else liked him because</i>

01:32:44.291 --> 01:32:46.166
<i>they could get anything out of him
that they wanted.</i>

01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:48.125
<i>They couldn't do that with Jimmy.</i>

01:32:49.541 --> 01:32:52.291
<i>That's what happens
when you go away to college.</i>

01:32:52.375 --> 01:32:53.583
How's that?

01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:57.708
Jimmy's pissed off with Fitz.

01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:01.000
Fitz is okay. We like Fitz.

01:33:01.083 --> 01:33:02.958
I'll tell you what the problem is.

01:33:03.041 --> 01:33:05.041
Jimmy's got that ballbusting Dorfman

01:33:05.125 --> 01:33:08.458
holding up loans that Fitz already okayed.

01:33:09.791 --> 01:33:11.166
I hate that Dorfman.

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:13.416
He's such a pain-in-the-ass fucking Jew.

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:18.416
What do you want me to do?

01:33:18.958 --> 01:33:21.000
No, not that. Not that.

01:33:22.625 --> 01:33:26.375
What you gotta do is, you know,
put a firecracker up Dorfman's ass.

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:28.750
Fitz'll get the message.

01:33:29.416 --> 01:33:31.166
He'll get the message.

01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:33.083
I mean,
you can't do it to Fitz because if...

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.083
if you do it to that lush,

01:33:35.166 --> 01:33:37.541
he'll run right to the feds
and screw up everything.

01:33:38.166 --> 01:33:39.416
But Dorfman...

01:33:39.916 --> 01:33:41.708
You gotta do it to Dorfman.

- Fuck is this?
- Who's this guy?

01:34:40.458 --> 01:34:41.583

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.583
Mr. Provenzano.
I'm Agent DiGregorio of the FBI.

Please stand.

- No, sir. Please stand.

01:34:50.375 --> 01:34:52.541

a bad fucking hand anyway.

01:34:52.625 --> 01:34:53.875
Middle of the game.

I got fucking shorts on here.

Look at this penguin over there, huh?

01:35:03.541 --> 01:35:05.583
Hey, Tony, will you get my bags?

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:06.875
Yeah, I'll get your bags, Tony.

01:35:06.958 --> 01:35:08.750

01:35:32.375 --> 01:35:33.791
Thank you, Pete.

01:35:41.708 --> 01:35:44.750
I gotta talk to you about a problem
I got with my pension.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I know.

01:35:49.875 --> 01:35:50.708
Oh, you know?

01:36:02.416 --> 01:36:04.083
So you'll look into it for me?

01:36:04.791 --> 01:36:06.916
How am I going to look into it?
What am I gonna look into?

01:36:07.916 --> 01:36:09.250

01:36:09.875 --> 01:36:11.000
Well, what is it?

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:12.791
You lost it.

01:36:13.291 --> 01:36:16.750
You forfeited it when you came in here.
That's it.

01:36:18.416 --> 01:36:20.333
So is yours forfeited too?

01:36:20.416 --> 01:36:21.375
No.

01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:27.125
Let me get this straight.
So yours is still there,

01:36:27.208 --> 01:36:29.291
your million five, whatever it is,

01:36:29.375 --> 01:36:30.750
but mine's gone?

01:36:31.875 --> 01:36:33.958
Yeah. Mine's still there.

01:36:36.916 --> 01:36:38.458
But we're both sitting here.

01:36:38.541 --> 01:36:40.916
We're both sitting here. That's right.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.375
Only we're sitting here
for different things.

01:36:44.166 --> 01:36:46.458
You're sitting here for extortion.

01:36:46.541 --> 01:36:48.833
I'm sitting here for fraud.

01:36:49.416 --> 01:36:52.458
- So?
- So? So there's a difference.

01:36:52.541 --> 01:36:53.666
What's the difference?

01:36:56.875 --> 01:36:59.500
I didn't threaten anybody, you did.

01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:01.333
So what? That makes no sense.

01:37:01.416 --> 01:37:02.625
What do you mean? It does.

01:37:02.708 --> 01:37:04.500
No, it doesn't. I don't want a debate.

01:37:04.583 --> 01:37:07.000
- Think about it.
- I'm thinking about it, Jimmy.

01:37:07.083 --> 01:37:08.416
No, don't fuck with me, Jimmy.

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:09.958
Just do something about it.

01:37:14.875 --> 01:37:16.791
What do you mean,
"do something about it"?

01:37:16.875 --> 01:37:17.791
What am I gonna do?

01:37:17.875 --> 01:37:19.541
Come on,
there's always something you can do.

01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:20.833
No. It's federal law.

01:37:20.916 --> 01:37:22.583
- I don't care.
- You don't care?

01:37:22.666 --> 01:37:24.541
No, you can still do something about it.

01:37:24.625 --> 01:37:26.458
There's nothing I can do.
What can I do?

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:28.166
You can get my fucking money.

01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:29.166
How?

01:37:29.250 --> 01:37:30.541
- Some other way.
- What way?

01:37:30.625 --> 01:37:32.000
The same way you got your money.

01:37:32.083 --> 01:37:34.125
Shh. Lower your fucking voice.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.625
You telling me to lower my voice?

01:37:36.708 --> 01:37:37.750
I'm tellin' you to lower
your fucking voice.

01:37:37.833 --> 01:37:39.000
Cocksucker.

01:37:39.083 --> 01:37:40.458
- Don't call me a cocksucker.
- Fuck you.

01:37:40.541 --> 01:37:42.041
Don't you fucking dare.

01:37:43.333 --> 01:37:45.083
Look, you're here for fraud.

01:37:45.166 --> 01:37:46.750
- You stole money.
- I stole money?

01:37:46.833 --> 01:37:47.833
Yeah, I stole money.

01:37:47.916 --> 01:37:49.541
Okay, fine, in a different way, but still,

01:37:50.166 --> 01:37:52.125
I want what I'm fucking owed.

01:37:53.666 --> 01:37:55.333
You people. You people.

01:37:55.416 --> 01:37:56.583
- What did you say?
- Oh, my God!

01:37:56.666 --> 01:37:57.500
What did you say?

01:37:57.583 --> 01:37:59.000
Oh, come on, what I said.

01:37:59.083 --> 01:38:00.500
What the fuck did I say?

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:01.791
"You people." You said "You people."

01:38:01.875 --> 01:38:03.708
What does that fucking mean,
"You people"?

01:38:03.791 --> 01:38:05.125
I'm done

01:38:05.208 --> 01:38:06.916
talking about this.

01:38:07.583 --> 01:38:09.208
- "You people"?
- I'm done!

01:38:09.291 --> 01:38:11.083
You're done?
I'll rip your fucking head off!

01:38:11.166 --> 01:38:12.916
- Fucking piece of shit!
- Hey!

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.416
I'll fucking kill you!

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:21.291
I'll fucking kill you. Motherfucker!

01:38:21.375 --> 01:38:22.416
What the fuck...

01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:30.625
Right then, you knew
it was all gonna fall apart.

01:39:00.541 --> 01:39:02.375
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>that crazy bastard</i>

01:39:02.458 --> 01:39:03.708
<i>thought he could do that</i>

01:39:03.791 --> 01:39:06.916
right there at Columbus Circle,
in front of 5,000 people

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.333
and get away with it.

01:39:08.416 --> 01:39:11.208
I can't believe it.
That is not right, Frankie.

01:39:11.291 --> 01:39:12.375
That is not right.

01:39:12.458 --> 01:39:14.958
That is a total piece of shit.

01:39:15.583 --> 01:39:17.541
That's a piece of shit.

01:39:17.625 --> 01:39:19.791
<i>There's only one guy</i>
<i>who would have the balls,</i>

01:39:19.875 --> 01:39:22.750
<i>the nerve, the audacity to do that.</i>

01:39:31.958 --> 01:39:34.916
<i>He was known Downtown
as "Joey the Blond,"</i>

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.666
<i>but everybody,
especially the newspapers,</i>

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:40.000
<i>called him "Crazy Joe."</i>

01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:41.875
...shall be the truth,

01:39:41.958 --> 01:39:44.875
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:39:44.958 --> 01:39:46.583
- I do.
- Be seated.

01:39:49.291 --> 01:39:51.750
Mr. Gallo, do you have
an opening statement?

01:39:53.458 --> 01:39:54.458
Yeah.

01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:59.375
This carpet would be great
for a crap game.

01:40:03.541 --> 01:40:05.083
<i>Russ was right.</i>

01:40:05.166 --> 01:40:08.083
<i>I mean, who the hell else runs around
with show business people like that,</i>

01:40:08.166 --> 01:40:10.833
<i>getting his picture taken
in the papers all the time,</i>

01:40:10.916 --> 01:40:13.833
<i>drawing attention to himself
and everybody. What is that?</i>

01:40:14.458 --> 01:40:16.958
<i>Who does he think he is, Erroll Flynn?</i>

01:40:17.041 --> 01:40:19.208
He went against
everything and everybody.

01:40:19.291 --> 01:40:20.791
Just didn't give a shit.

01:40:20.875 --> 01:40:23.458
And, growing up,
he kidnapped his own bosses.

01:40:23.541 --> 01:40:25.333
I don't know how he got away with that.

01:40:25.416 --> 01:40:28.375
You don't get away with that.
You do that, you die.

01:40:28.458 --> 01:40:29.541
That simple.

01:40:29.625 --> 01:40:31.083
When he went away to the can,

01:40:31.166 --> 01:40:33.958
he recruited black guys
instead of his own kind.

01:40:34.041 --> 01:40:36.041
And when he got out,
nobody knew what he was doing,

01:40:36.125 --> 01:40:37.125
or who he was doing with it.

01:40:37.208 --> 01:40:39.833
We didn't know what the hell
was going on. Nobody did.

01:40:40.333 --> 01:40:41.916
And if you don't like what he's doing,

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.416
and you say something,

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.333
then you see what happens.

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.958
<i>Who does something like that?</i>
<i>Who does things like that?</i>

01:41:16.041 --> 01:41:17.958
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

01:41:18.041 --> 01:41:19.166
<i>Sta test e cazzu.</i>

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:20.708
This<i> disgraziato.</i>

01:41:20.791 --> 01:41:23.166
Him and Oswald. Two of a kind.

01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:25.333
At least in Dallas,
the kids weren't there.

01:41:25.416 --> 01:41:26.791
It was just Jackie.

01:41:26.875 --> 01:41:29.333
Joey, your doctor called.
You died an hour ago.

01:41:31.125 --> 01:41:32.833
You a Jewish fellow?

01:41:32.916 --> 01:41:35.000
Would you like to be?

01:41:35.083 --> 01:41:37.458
Don't worry about the operation.
We don't do that no more.

01:41:37.541 --> 01:41:38.875
We freeze it.

01:41:39.375 --> 01:41:41.000
And you stand there
and don't do anything

01:41:41.083 --> 01:41:43.000
and a Mexican broad
comes over with a wet rock.

01:41:43.083 --> 01:41:44.541
Thwack!

01:41:44.625 --> 01:41:46.958
See, it's okay to laugh.
I make fun of everybody.

01:41:47.041 --> 01:41:49.791
That's why God put us on this earth,
to laugh.

01:41:49.875 --> 01:41:51.125
I work everyone.

01:41:51.208 --> 01:41:53.416
I make fun of blacks, I make fun of Jews.

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.750
I work Gypsies, I work Italians.

01:41:55.833 --> 01:41:57.583
Well, not those Italians.

01:41:57.666 --> 01:41:59.416
No, no, no, no!

01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:01.916
It's okay, Joey.
I got the money. Don't shoot.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.208
I was told today,

01:42:05.291 --> 01:42:07.750
"Be very careful about what you say."

01:42:07.833 --> 01:42:11.000
But, uh, all kidding aside,
happy birthday, Joey.

01:42:21.916 --> 01:42:22.791
Hey, Russ.

01:42:24.666 --> 01:42:27.000
Hey. What are you doing with that?

01:42:29.958 --> 01:42:32.166
You really believe
in that bullshit league?

01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:35.041
Well, it's not that.

01:42:35.125 --> 01:42:36.333
It's Italian.

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:37.750
Joey. Joey.

01:42:37.833 --> 01:42:38.833
- What did I say?
- Oh, no, no.

01:42:38.916 --> 01:42:40.625
- What did I say?
- Joey, Joey. Joey. Joey.

01:42:41.416 --> 01:42:42.375
Now, listen.

01:42:43.625 --> 01:42:46.166
You can't say that stuff like that here.
Okay? You can't do that.

01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:48.083
Why not? Rickles is the only one
who can make jokes?

01:42:48.166 --> 01:42:49.333
The man's a boss.

01:42:49.416 --> 01:42:52.000
So I'm a boss. He's a boss.
We're all supposed to be brothers, right?

01:42:52.083 --> 01:42:52.916
I know you're a boss.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.666
I know, but we don't wanna
have a beef now. Okay?

01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:56.875
- We're brothers, right?
- That's right, brothers.

01:42:56.958 --> 01:42:58.625
- We're brothers?
- You're brothers.

01:42:58.708 --> 01:43:00.291
- We're brothers.
- I'm not arguing with you.

01:43:00.375 --> 01:43:01.458
Everybody's a brother.

01:43:01.541 --> 01:43:03.250
That's right, you're a brother.
You're his brother.

01:43:03.333 --> 01:43:04.625
I'm not, but you guys are.

01:43:04.708 --> 01:43:06.708
So that's why
I would like it if you just...

01:43:06.791 --> 01:43:07.750
- All right.
- Okay?

01:43:07.833 --> 01:43:09.333
- We're brothers?
- You're brothers.

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:11.125
Oh, yeah. It's my birthday.

01:43:11.208 --> 01:43:12.541
Happy birthday.

01:43:12.625 --> 01:43:14.000
Happy birthday.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.958
Get the fuck out of here.

01:43:39.416 --> 01:43:41.333
<i>Now, for something like this,</i>

01:43:41.416 --> 01:43:43.333
<i>you're gonna need two guns.</i>

01:43:43.416 --> 01:43:45.958
<i>The one you're gonna use
and a backup.</i>

01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:50.083
<i>You want something with more
stopping power than a .22.</i>

01:43:55.708 --> 01:43:57.750
<i>You definitely don't want a silencer.</i>

01:43:57.833 --> 01:44:00.833
<i>You want to make a lot of noise
to make the witnesses run away</i>

01:44:00.916 --> 01:44:02.750
<i>so they ain't gonna be looking at you.</i>

01:44:05.583 --> 01:44:07.583
<i>But not the noise a .45 makes</i>

01:44:07.666 --> 01:44:09.208
<i>'cause that makes too much noise,</i>

01:44:09.291 --> 01:44:11.833
<i>and a patrol car can hear it
a few blocks away at least.</i>

01:44:15.708 --> 01:44:19.625
<i>The cops call a .32 a woman's gun
because it's easier to handle</i>

01:44:19.708 --> 01:44:21.708
<i>and don't do the damage a .38 does,</i>

01:44:21.791 --> 01:44:24.208
<i>but, you know, it does enough.</i>

01:44:31.708 --> 01:44:36.125
<i> It would be late,</i>
<i>so the tourists from Idaho</i>

01:44:36.208 --> 01:44:38.208
<i>wouldn't be there.
They'd be in bed.</i>

01:44:38.291 --> 01:44:40.291
<i>And him being down there in Little Italy,</i>

01:44:40.375 --> 01:44:43.375
<i>maybe he'd be more comfortable,
more relaxed.</i>

01:44:44.708 --> 01:44:47.750
<i>It was his birthday
so he'd be there with his wife</i>

01:44:47.833 --> 01:44:50.125
<i>and his kid which, in this case,</i>

01:44:50.208 --> 01:44:52.458
<i>that's good
because that's the point.</i>

01:44:52.541 --> 01:44:54.500
<i>They should have to see what it's like.</i>

01:44:56.375 --> 01:44:58.250
<i>He'd already been drinking,</i>

01:44:58.333 --> 01:45:00.250
<i>which would have slowed him down a lot.</i>

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:02.833
<i>His bodyguard would be with him</i>

01:45:02.916 --> 01:45:04.750
<i>and Joey himself could be carrying, too,</i>

01:45:04.833 --> 01:45:07.958
<i>but then the piece would be
in his wife's purse probably.</i>

01:45:14.291 --> 01:45:17.000
<i>You never got
a lot of advance notice.</i>

01:45:17.583 --> 01:45:19.666
<i>All you knew was your part of it.</i>

01:45:21.708 --> 01:45:24.708
<i>John the Redhead knew only one thing:</i>

01:45:24.791 --> 01:45:26.666
<i>he was gonna drop me off,</i>

01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:29.750
<i>circle the block and pick me up.</i>

01:45:37.916 --> 01:45:40.375
<i>You wanna take out the bodyguard first.</i>

01:45:40.458 --> 01:45:43.416
<i>Not kill him.
Don't kill him, just disable him.</i>

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.375
<i>You got no argument with him,</i>

01:45:45.458 --> 01:45:48.000
<i>so, not in the face or the chest.</i>

01:45:49.458 --> 01:45:52.166
<i>Sometimes, with something like this,</i>

01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:54.750
<i>you might want to go
to the bathroom first.</i>

01:45:55.666 --> 01:45:58.375
<i>It gives you a chance to make sure
nobody followed you in.</i>

01:45:58.458 --> 01:45:59.833
<i>It also gives you a chance to make sure</i>

01:45:59.916 --> 01:46:02.416
<i>nobody is in the bathroom
you have to worry about.</i>

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.291
<i>It also gives you a chance
to go to the bathroom.</i>

01:46:05.375 --> 01:46:07.125
<i>You don't want to be uncomfortable.</i>

01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:11.000
<i>But I went before,
and in a place this small, this late,</i>

01:46:11.083 --> 01:46:13.125
<i>you might as well just get to work.</i>

01:46:13.208 --> 01:46:14.500
We need more wine, all right?

01:46:14.583 --> 01:46:16.750
Hey, Tommy, some more wine.

01:46:16.833 --> 01:46:17.708
So how about after?

01:46:17.791 --> 01:46:19.500
- Cake, cake, cake!
- Not yet.

01:46:19.583 --> 01:46:21.333
You're not even done eating the meal yet.

01:46:21.416 --> 01:46:23.666
You want the cake?
Come on, you can't do that.

01:46:27.041 --> 01:46:28.041
Shit!

01:46:28.125 --> 01:46:29.833
Fuck! Fuck!

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.416
<i>It happened</i>
<i>in New York's Little Italy,</i>

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:09.833
<i>an area rumored to be neutral territory
among mobsters.</i>

01:47:09.916 --> 01:47:11.041
<i>After the killing,</i>

01:47:11.125 --> 01:47:13.291
<i>police found several guns
and some fingerprints</i>

01:47:13.375 --> 01:47:15.166
<i>which they were tracing today.</i>

01:47:15.250 --> 01:47:16.625
<i>Joseph "Crazy Joe" Gallo</i>

01:47:16.708 --> 01:47:19.083
<i>had come
to the intimate seafood restaurant</i>

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:20.875
<i>to cap an evening of celebration</i>

01:47:20.958 --> 01:47:22.750
<i>with his new bride of less than a month,</i>

01:47:22.833 --> 01:47:25.541
<i>and his 11-year-old daughter
by a previous marriage.</i>

01:47:25.625 --> 01:47:29.500
<i>They were, uh, celebrating</i>
<i>Joe's 47th birthday.</i>

01:47:29.583 --> 01:47:32.250
<i>They had been to a nightclub
early in the evening.</i>

01:47:32.333 --> 01:47:36.625
<i>They were sitting at a rear table,
this group of six people,</i>

01:47:37.208 --> 01:47:38.458
<i>when a, uh...</i>

01:47:39.291 --> 01:47:40.291
<i>a man walked in</i>

01:47:40.375 --> 01:47:43.916
<i>from the back door,
and he walked up, uh,</i>

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.625
<i>to the side of the table.
He fired three shots.</i>

01:47:47.708 --> 01:47:49.458
<i>He hit Joe twice</i>

01:47:49.541 --> 01:47:51.250
<i>- and he hit his bodyguard...</i>
- Peggy, let's go.

01:47:51.333 --> 01:47:53.541
<i>...Pete the Greek, one time.</i>

01:47:53.625 --> 01:47:56.125
<i>There was a total of 14 shots fired.</i>

01:47:56.208 --> 01:47:57.041
Peggy, come on.

01:47:57.833 --> 01:47:59.916
<i>It's quiet here</i>
<i>on President Street,</i>

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.333
<i>Joey Gallo's turf.</i>

01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:03.500
<i>In fact, it's too quiet.</i>

01:48:04.166 --> 01:48:05.000
<i>Out here in Brooklyn,</i>

01:48:05.083 --> 01:48:06.708
<i>Joey Gallo was a hero.</i>

01:48:06.791 --> 01:48:10.458
<i>Speculation has it
that his death may start a gang war,</i>

01:48:10.541 --> 01:48:12.416
<i>if it hasn't already begun.</i>

01:48:46.416 --> 01:48:48.583
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- You too, Mikey.

01:48:48.666 --> 01:48:50.250
Take good care, Jimmy.

01:48:50.333 --> 01:48:51.750
If I don't see you again, hello.

01:48:51.833 --> 01:48:55.083
<i>Four years later</i>
<i>and $500,000 under the table</i>

01:48:55.166 --> 01:48:57.083
<i>to Nixon's re-election committee,</i>

01:48:57.166 --> 01:48:59.083
<i>Jimmy finally got what he wanted.</i>

01:48:59.166 --> 01:49:00.791
Sorry, but I won't be back.

01:49:00.875 --> 01:49:04.041
<i>A presidential pardon</i>
<i>and his parole.</i>

01:49:04.125 --> 01:49:05.750
Jimmy!

01:49:05.833 --> 01:49:06.958
What are you
gonna do now, Jimmy?

01:49:07.041 --> 01:49:10.375
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do is register

01:49:10.458 --> 01:49:12.041
with the Federal Probation Office,

01:49:12.125 --> 01:49:16.416
and then I'm going down to Florida
with my wife to get some sun.

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:17.500
Any plans after that?

01:49:17.583 --> 01:49:20.416
Yeah, I'm gonna take back
control of my union.

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.166
How're you gonna do that, Jimmy?

01:49:23.458 --> 01:49:25.166
How do you like Fitz running against you?

01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:26.083
I don't.

01:49:26.166 --> 01:49:28.083
What was it like
being locked up all that time?

01:49:28.166 --> 01:49:29.541
Oh, it was wonderful. Had a great time.

01:49:31.458 --> 01:49:35.000
<i>The first thing I did was,</i>
<i>I picked up some chili dogs from Lum's,</i>

01:49:35.083 --> 01:49:37.291
<i>which Jimmy loved
almost as much as ice cream.</i>

01:49:37.375 --> 01:49:41.000
<i>A consultant to President Richard Nixon's
re-election campaign committee...</i>

01:49:41.083 --> 01:49:43.333
<i>The secret is</i>
<i>they steam them in beer.</i>

01:49:43.416 --> 01:49:45.500
<i>There ain't a better hot dog in America.</i>

01:49:45.583 --> 01:49:49.666
<i>Police say McCord and his accomplices
brought electronic listening devices</i>

01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:52.625
<i>with them and had removed
two ceiling panels...</i>

01:49:52.708 --> 01:49:55.250
<i>while installing
eavesdropping equipment</i>

01:49:55.333 --> 01:49:57.041
<i>at the Democratic National Committee.</i>

01:49:58.083 --> 01:50:01.125
Look at this. He's got the balls
to run for President of the Teamsters.

01:50:01.208 --> 01:50:03.750
Look at this.
And Tony Pro giving him an award.

01:50:03.833 --> 01:50:05.416
This fuck... Do you believe it?

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:08.083
Look, Fitz is very popular
with certain people.

01:50:08.166 --> 01:50:10.000
Of course he's popular.
Who wouldn't be popular?

01:50:10.083 --> 01:50:12.541
He loans money
to every goombah who asks.

01:50:12.625 --> 01:50:15.916
That's why Tony's behind him.
He's given Fitz all his votes.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.166
You got great support
from most of the union.

01:50:18.250 --> 01:50:21.333
All you need is Tony Pro's voters
in the Northeast, and you can win.

01:50:21.416 --> 01:50:23.541
- You sure you don't want one of these?
- No, thank you.

01:50:23.625 --> 01:50:27.541
I just can't believe
I gotta go to Tony Pro to get votes.

01:50:27.625 --> 01:50:28.625
What is that?

01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:33.041
Tony has Fitz
in his pocket, Jimmy.

01:50:33.125 --> 01:50:34.666
Wise guys don't run the union.

01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:35.958
With Fitz, they do.

01:50:37.041 --> 01:50:39.583
Jimmy, listen,
as soon as you're back as president,

01:50:39.666 --> 01:50:40.625
you can do anything you want to.

01:50:40.708 --> 01:50:42.541
You can fire anybody you want to.

01:50:42.625 --> 01:50:44.583
You can even fire Tony Pro.

01:50:44.666 --> 01:50:45.750
Whoa.

01:50:45.833 --> 01:50:48.666
You could stand over him,
watch him clear out his desk.

01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:50.708
You could strip-search the guy.

01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.541
Make sure he doesn't walk off
with a paper clip.

01:50:53.625 --> 01:50:55.708
Ooh, yes. See that? Did you hear that?

01:50:57.333 --> 01:50:59.000
See, everybody thinks
Jo's the nice one

01:50:59.083 --> 01:51:00.791
and I'm the bad guy.

01:51:00.875 --> 01:51:02.125
But it's opposite.

01:51:02.875 --> 01:51:05.583
She's the killer and I'm the sweetheart.

01:51:06.916 --> 01:51:09.291
Now I gotta make peace
with the cocksucker.

01:51:09.375 --> 01:51:12.166
Oh, I want
to make up with you.

01:51:12.875 --> 01:51:15.541
I need you to endorse me. Please, Tony.

01:51:15.625 --> 01:51:16.916
Please.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.250
Fucking...

01:51:18.333 --> 01:51:20.708
I'm not gonna get through this.

01:51:20.791 --> 01:51:22.833
You gotta talk to him, that's all.
Just...

01:51:22.916 --> 01:51:24.666
- You gotta deal with it.
<i>- Let the chips fall</i>

01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:27.083
<i>- where they may.</i>
- Oh, he is a cocksucker, though.

01:51:28.125 --> 01:51:30.250
If I sat down with him,
would you come along?

01:51:30.333 --> 01:51:31.583
What are you talking about?
Of course.

01:51:31.666 --> 01:51:33.125
How am I not gonna go with you?

01:51:42.875 --> 01:51:43.875
Fuck it. Let's go.

01:51:43.958 --> 01:51:45.750
Ah, Jimmy, Jimmy. Give it a chance.

01:51:45.833 --> 01:51:47.666
Give it a chance.
Give it a few more minutes.

01:51:49.875 --> 01:51:51.250
- Just...
- This isn't right.

01:51:51.333 --> 01:51:53.125
This isn't right. You don't do this.

01:51:53.208 --> 01:51:55.166
You don't keep a man waiting.

01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:56.500
I know. I know.

01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:59.666
The only time you do

01:51:59.750 --> 01:52:01.875
is when you want to say something.

01:52:02.583 --> 01:52:03.416
I know.

01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:05.291
When you want to say "Fuck you."

01:52:05.375 --> 01:52:06.875
That's the only time.

01:52:06.958 --> 01:52:08.916
Here they are.

01:52:11.125 --> 01:52:13.333
Can you believe this weather, Frank? Huh?

01:52:13.416 --> 01:52:16.500
It's 85 degrees outside. Perfect.

01:52:16.583 --> 01:52:18.083
Hey, Tony Jack.

01:52:18.166 --> 01:52:19.000
Jimmy.

01:52:19.083 --> 01:52:22.416
People freezing to death
in New York and look at us, huh?

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.416
Why we don't live here all year round
is what I wanna know.

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:26.416
- Oh.
- Beautiful.

01:52:27.416 --> 01:52:29.500
- It's summer.
- What?

01:52:30.291 --> 01:52:31.291
It's summer.

01:52:32.416 --> 01:52:34.583
People aren't freezing to death
in New York.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.166
It's summer.

01:52:39.583 --> 01:52:41.458
In my mind,
it's always eight degrees in New York.

01:52:41.541 --> 01:52:42.666
I'm making a point.

01:52:43.333 --> 01:52:44.541
You're making a point.

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:46.875
Making a point dressing like that?

01:52:47.583 --> 01:52:48.666
Is that how you dress for a meeting?

01:52:50.625 --> 01:52:54.041
This is how you dress in Florida?
In a suit?

01:52:54.125 --> 01:52:55.375
For a meeting?

01:52:56.083 --> 01:52:59.583
Anywhere.
Florida, Timbuktu, I dress in a suit.

01:52:59.666 --> 01:53:00.833
For a meetin'.

01:53:01.583 --> 01:53:03.291
- And you're late.
- What?

01:53:04.375 --> 01:53:05.375
You're late.

01:53:07.541 --> 01:53:08.791
Yeah, there was traffic.

01:53:08.875 --> 01:53:09.791
Yes, traffic.

01:53:09.875 --> 01:53:11.958
Wasn't there traffic?

01:53:12.041 --> 01:53:13.416
- You give me traffic?
- There was traffic.

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:14.583
What do you want from us?

01:53:14.666 --> 01:53:15.916
It was bumper to fuckin' bumper.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.875
Yeah, yeah. No, it's bad, you know?

01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:18.958
Traffic.

01:53:19.791 --> 01:53:22.833
I never waited for anyone who was late

01:53:23.458 --> 01:53:26.000
more than ten minutes in my life.

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.333
I'd say fifteen. Fifteen's right.

01:53:28.416 --> 01:53:29.541
No, ten.

01:53:30.833 --> 01:53:32.500
I don't think so, ten's not enough.

01:53:32.583 --> 01:53:34.375
You have to take traffic into account.

01:53:34.458 --> 01:53:37.291
That's what I'm doing.
I'm taking traffic into account.

01:53:38.083 --> 01:53:39.083
That's why it's ten.

01:53:39.166 --> 01:53:41.166
- I still say 15.
- No, ten.

01:53:42.208 --> 01:53:44.250
Fine. We disagree on that.

01:53:44.333 --> 01:53:45.875
How about twelve and a half minutes?

01:53:45.958 --> 01:53:47.250
There we go, 12.5.

01:53:47.333 --> 01:53:49.458
The middle. Right in the middle.
Beautiful.

01:53:49.541 --> 01:53:51.125
More than ten...

01:53:52.291 --> 01:53:53.541
you're saying something.

01:53:54.791 --> 01:53:56.708
- You saying something to me?
- I'm here.

01:53:57.375 --> 01:53:59.541
- Mmm.
- It says what it says.

01:54:01.083 --> 01:54:02.666
So there it is.

01:54:04.208 --> 01:54:05.333
Where do we go from here?

01:54:08.125 --> 01:54:09.583
Well, what can I do for you?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.333
I want you...

01:54:16.541 --> 01:54:17.708
I...

01:54:18.666 --> 01:54:20.250
I want you to endorse me...

01:54:22.333 --> 01:54:24.458
for you know what.

01:54:24.541 --> 01:54:27.875
Before we get to that,
let's straighten that other thing up.

01:54:27.958 --> 01:54:30.125
No. The other thing
is none of my business.

01:54:30.208 --> 01:54:32.541
I can't do anything about your pension.

01:54:32.625 --> 01:54:36.166
I can't. Not with Fitz in there.
Fitz is in there, you know.

01:54:36.250 --> 01:54:37.416
- You go to Fitz.
- I did.

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:38.750
- He'll help you out.
- I did.

01:54:38.833 --> 01:54:41.083
He said he'll take care of it,
no questions asked.

01:54:41.166 --> 01:54:43.083
You wouldn't do that but he will.

01:54:43.791 --> 01:54:45.291
I meant the other thing.

01:54:47.166 --> 01:54:48.166
What other thing?

01:54:48.250 --> 01:54:49.625
You know.

01:54:49.708 --> 01:54:51.083
I don't know.

01:54:51.166 --> 01:54:52.458
Your apology.

01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:55.625
My apology?

01:54:57.375 --> 01:54:58.625
My apology for what?

01:54:58.708 --> 01:55:00.375
For what you said
when you were sitting there

01:55:00.458 --> 01:55:02.666
eating your ice cream
like some fucking king.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.333
That was an ethnic slur. "You people."

01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:08.958
- Did you know what he said?
- Nah, I mean, I heard...

01:55:09.041 --> 01:55:11.333
I heard you had an altercation
in the can, but I don't know.

01:55:11.416 --> 01:55:13.041
Yeah, "you people."

01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:16.250
That's what you said. Right, Jim?

01:55:17.833 --> 01:55:20.041
"You people." Am I beneath you?

01:55:22.125 --> 01:55:23.291
Definitely.

01:55:23.375 --> 01:55:25.333
- Jimmy, come on.
- Jimmy, what're you doing?

01:55:25.416 --> 01:55:27.458
Don't forget, "you people"
got you where you are.

01:55:27.541 --> 01:55:29.416
Oh, don't tell me that, you fucking...

01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:30.666
That's your problem, Jimmy.

01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:32.875
Your problem is you're a piece of shit.

01:55:32.958 --> 01:55:33.875
Jimmy, come on.

01:55:33.958 --> 01:55:35.833
- Jimmy, what are you doin'?
- Jesus, Jimmy, come on.

01:55:35.916 --> 01:55:37.916
I asked for your endorsement
and you're giving me...

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.041
I asked for your apology.

01:55:39.125 --> 01:55:41.500
Who the fuck are you to apologize to?

01:55:41.583 --> 01:55:42.875
Jimmy...

01:55:42.958 --> 01:55:44.333
Who the fuck are you?

01:55:44.416 --> 01:55:45.416
Be gentle.

01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.250
- I don't need this.
- Let's just sit down. Tony.

01:55:47.333 --> 01:55:49.291
I need this? I need you?

01:55:49.375 --> 01:55:50.791
- Yeah, you need me.
- Oh, please.

01:55:50.875 --> 01:55:52.333
Jimmy, come on.
You're asking him for something.

01:55:52.416 --> 01:55:55.333
The guy gets me nervous.
He talks about things that get me upset.

01:55:55.416 --> 01:55:56.583
Take it easy. Everybody's here.

01:55:56.666 --> 01:55:59.208
Let's have the fucking meeting.
Come on.

01:55:59.291 --> 01:56:00.875
- Let's talk.
- That's all.

01:56:00.958 --> 01:56:02.083
He's here.

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:08.583
Was this the altercation
youse had in the can?

01:56:08.666 --> 01:56:09.625
Yeah, it was something like this.

01:56:09.708 --> 01:56:11.375
We... We got to arm wrestling.

01:56:12.541 --> 01:56:13.416
He lost.

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:15.458
I lost. You should see his ribs.

01:56:16.583 --> 01:56:17.416
Why don't you just talk about

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.916
what you need to talk about.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.250
What do you want me to do?

01:56:22.208 --> 01:56:23.041
I said, "you people."

01:56:23.125 --> 01:56:25.000
What do you want me to do,
apologize for it?

01:56:25.083 --> 01:56:27.166
That's exactly what I want,
Jimmy. An apology.

01:56:27.791 --> 01:56:29.666
I'll apologize for it.

01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:30.875
That's all I want.

01:56:32.541 --> 01:56:34.125
After you apologize

01:56:34.708 --> 01:56:36.000
for being late,

01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:39.041
you motherfucking wop cocksucker.

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:42.458
Jimmy, are you
out of your fucking mind?

01:56:42.541 --> 01:56:44.333
I'll apologize for being late

01:56:44.416 --> 01:56:46.791
after I kidnap your granddaughter,
rip her guts out,

01:56:46.875 --> 01:56:48.500
and send them to you
in a fucking envelope!

01:56:52.916 --> 01:56:54.833
Get him off! Come on!

01:56:54.916 --> 01:56:55.833
I'll fucking kill him!

01:56:55.916 --> 01:56:57.166
Come on, Tony! Jesus!

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.708
You think Russ would...

01:57:04.791 --> 01:57:06.541
would do something about this guy?

01:57:07.458 --> 01:57:09.125
Ah, that's complicated.

01:57:10.208 --> 01:57:11.458
Yeah. It's complicated.

01:57:11.541 --> 01:57:13.875
I'd like to clip the motherfucker myself,
you know,

01:57:13.958 --> 01:57:16.250
- get the okay from them. But...
- I know.

01:57:16.333 --> 01:57:17.791
This guy's gotta go.

01:57:18.458 --> 01:57:19.541
- He's gotta go, Frank.
- Yeah.

01:57:20.375 --> 01:57:22.208
I'm not gonna get the okay to do that.

01:57:23.666 --> 01:57:25.541
Frank, just talk to the guy.

01:57:25.625 --> 01:57:27.708
Okay? Just talk to him.

01:57:36.458 --> 01:57:37.541
<i>These guys from Jersey keep</i>

01:57:37.625 --> 01:57:40.000
<i>fucking calling me about this bullshit
between these two guys.</i>

01:57:40.083 --> 01:57:42.500
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told them.

01:57:43.333 --> 01:57:44.166
I don't approve

01:57:44.250 --> 01:57:45.833
- of what Pro said about Jimmy.
- No.

01:57:45.916 --> 01:57:48.833
I mean, who talks like that
about a person's grandchildren?

01:57:49.375 --> 01:57:51.166
- It's not fucking right.
- No.

01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:57.708
But Pro isn't nobody.

01:57:58.916 --> 01:58:00.208
Jimmy should know that.

01:58:00.291 --> 01:58:01.541
Hey, what am I gonna go?

01:58:01.625 --> 01:58:04.375
I'm not gonna tell this guy
what he can or can't fucking say,

01:58:04.458 --> 01:58:05.708
like he's a child.

01:58:05.791 --> 01:58:07.083
Well, listen.

01:58:07.166 --> 01:58:09.083
Jimmy don't mean nothing.
He just gets upset.

01:58:09.166 --> 01:58:11.000
Russ, come on,
we all know he's a fucking hothead.

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:12.416
We're all hotheads once in a while.

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:14.750
Yeah, but Jimmy says things
he shouldn't say sometimes.

01:58:14.833 --> 01:58:16.375
Yeah. We all do that too.

01:58:16.458 --> 01:58:18.333
Well, somebody should just calm him down.

01:58:23.083 --> 01:58:24.708
Yeah, well, that... I'm gonna...

01:58:24.791 --> 01:58:26.791
I'm gonna calm him down.
He's difficult, but...

01:58:26.875 --> 01:58:28.791
Maybe this could help him calm down.

01:58:28.875 --> 01:58:30.666
You could tell him
that I always liked him.

01:58:31.666 --> 01:58:32.666
Huh?

01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:35.750
And I won't stand in his way
of him trying to get his job back.

01:58:35.833 --> 01:58:36.958
I will. I will tell him that, Tony.

01:58:37.041 --> 01:58:38.000
- Okay?
- Yes.

01:58:38.083 --> 01:58:40.666
That's not making me calm down.

01:58:40.750 --> 01:58:42.000
Standing by me.

01:58:42.541 --> 01:58:44.625
What the fuck does that mean?

01:58:44.708 --> 01:58:48.125
Standing by me ain't the same thing
as doing something

01:58:48.208 --> 01:58:51.708
about some out-of-control
fucking psycho!

01:58:52.333 --> 01:58:55.208
Jimmy, the Little Guy ain't a nobody.
You gotta understand that.

01:58:55.291 --> 01:58:56.958
- He ain't a nobody.
- He's a cocksucker.

01:58:57.041 --> 01:58:58.750
Fitz is a cocksucker.

01:58:59.625 --> 01:59:02.083
I'm gonna deal
with both these cocksuckers...

01:59:02.166 --> 01:59:03.291
myself!

01:59:04.125 --> 01:59:06.208
This used to be my office.

01:59:06.291 --> 01:59:09.375
Go look for Frank Fitzsimmons there.
You're not gonna find him.

01:59:09.458 --> 01:59:12.458
That's because he travels
all over the country

01:59:12.541 --> 01:59:15.750
looking for goddamn golf courses
because that's what he does.

01:59:15.833 --> 01:59:16.875
<i>He plays golf.</i>

01:59:16.958 --> 01:59:20.791
<i>Who is he to run around with Nixon,
run around with the attorney general?</i>

01:59:20.875 --> 01:59:24.958
<i>He does this and collects full-time salary
while he's doing it.</i>

01:59:25.041 --> 01:59:26.291
<i>Now, how do you do that?</i>

01:59:26.375 --> 01:59:29.375
<i>There's not enough hours
in a day to do this job.</i>

01:59:29.458 --> 01:59:31.625
<i>I was sent to prison for fraud.</i>

01:59:32.333 --> 01:59:34.041
<i>This is fraud, what he's doing.</i>

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.291
<i>So what's Fitz's answer to Jimmy?</i>

01:59:38.375 --> 01:59:39.708
<i>He does it by sending a message</i>

01:59:39.791 --> 01:59:42.500
<i>to Jimmy's old friend, Dave Johnson.</i>

01:59:42.583 --> 01:59:45.833
<i>Now, Dave Johnson, he ran Local 299.</i>

01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:49.041
<i>This was the message.</i>

01:59:53.250 --> 01:59:54.416
<i>So this is how</i>

01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:57.333
Fitz says he wants my old pal Dave Johnson

01:59:57.416 --> 02:00:00.041
to step down so he can have his son

02:00:00.125 --> 02:00:02.625
take over Local 299.

02:00:03.125 --> 02:00:07.333
This is how I'm gonna say no to his son,
little fucking Fitz.

02:00:08.791 --> 02:00:09.958
She looked a lot like your mother.

02:00:10.041 --> 02:00:11.875
- About the same size.
- Pops, come on, you told me...

02:00:11.958 --> 02:00:14.291
Good-looking girl.
She was a good-looking girl.

02:00:14.375 --> 02:00:16.666
But I had no idea
that it wasn't your mother.

02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:17.583
It was dark and...

02:00:26.916 --> 02:00:29.458
<i>This is how</i>
<i>Fitz says he doesn't like</i>

02:00:29.541 --> 02:00:31.791
<i>who I say runs the 299.</i>

02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:34.041
<i>By firing my wife from her</i>

02:00:34.125 --> 02:00:37.958
forty-eight-fucking-thousand-
dollar-a-year union job!

02:01:21.166 --> 02:01:23.541
Son of a bitch. Fuck him!

02:01:23.625 --> 02:01:25.583
<i>He had</i>
<i>previously taped the locks</i>

02:01:25.666 --> 02:01:28.375
<i>on the entry door
of the basement of the Watergate...</i>

02:01:28.458 --> 02:01:29.916
- What are you looking at?
- Uh, it's...

02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:32.166
It's Big Ears.

02:01:32.708 --> 02:01:35.458
<i>He had noticed
that the tape had been removed,</i>

02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:38.833
<i>and he re-taped the door.</i>

02:01:39.458 --> 02:01:40.291
Big Ears?

02:01:41.125 --> 02:01:42.291
That's, uh...

02:01:42.375 --> 02:01:44.041
Somebody I met a long time ago. Just...

02:01:46.583 --> 02:01:47.791
His ears ain't so big.

02:01:47.875 --> 02:01:50.875
<i>...at that point,</i>
<i>I said "Let us junk it,"</i>

02:01:50.958 --> 02:01:52.541
<i>meaning let us scrap the operation.</i>

02:01:52.625 --> 02:01:56.750
<i>Mr. Liddy and Mr. McCord
talked between themselves</i>

02:01:56.833 --> 02:01:59.583
<i>and the decision was made to go.</i>

02:01:59.666 --> 02:02:00.958
<i>I thought it was very foolhardy...</i>

02:02:01.041 --> 02:02:02.916
<i>So, Frank Fitzsimmons,</i>
<i>in your opinion,</i>

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.416
should he remain
president of the Teamsters?

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:06.333
Absolutely not.

02:02:06.416 --> 02:02:09.500
Frank Fitzsimmons
has sold his union out

02:02:09.583 --> 02:02:11.125
to his underworld pals.

02:02:11.208 --> 02:02:12.833
<i>The mob controls him,</i>

02:02:13.416 --> 02:02:15.458
<i>which means it controls our pension fund.</i>

02:02:15.541 --> 02:02:19.625
<i>I'm talking about a billion dollars
in low or no-interest loans</i>

02:02:19.708 --> 02:02:22.333
<i>this man has given to known racketeers</i>

02:02:22.416 --> 02:02:24.041
<i>for their illegal enterprises.</i>

02:02:24.125 --> 02:02:25.000
<i>Not anymore.</i>

02:02:25.083 --> 02:02:28.250
<i>It's time for the rats to abandon ship.</i>

02:02:28.791 --> 02:02:29.833
Is he serious?

02:02:30.333 --> 02:02:32.416
Not Jimmy. This is all publicity.

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:34.458
He's running for office.
He's putting on a show.

02:02:34.541 --> 02:02:37.291
Yeah, it's all puff.
It's got no substance, nothing.

02:02:37.375 --> 02:02:39.291
Maybe he means what he says.

02:02:39.375 --> 02:02:41.958
- Tony, he's campaigning.
- Russ.

02:02:42.041 --> 02:02:43.875
He's liable to say any fucking thing.

02:02:43.958 --> 02:02:45.666
I don't care
if he's campaigning.

02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:47.000
He can't talk like that.

02:02:47.083 --> 02:02:48.250
It's no fucking good.

02:02:48.333 --> 02:02:51.375
- I understand what you're saying.
- You know what he should do, Russ?

02:02:51.458 --> 02:02:53.583
He should cash in that big pension of his.

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:56.291
Spend more time with his grandchildren.

02:02:56.375 --> 02:02:58.291
He got a beautiful family, no?

02:02:59.333 --> 02:03:00.375
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.

02:03:00.458 --> 02:03:01.791
Maybe he should relax.

02:03:03.958 --> 02:03:05.791
Word should get back to him.

02:03:10.333 --> 02:03:11.708
<i>I... I just wanna say...</i>

02:03:11.791 --> 02:03:14.083
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

02:03:14.625 --> 02:03:15.958
But there I was with some people

02:03:16.041 --> 02:03:17.875
and they were saying,
and you know who they are...

02:03:17.958 --> 02:03:19.083
They were saying...

02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:23.041
"Please tell Jimmy we love the guy."

02:03:23.875 --> 02:03:26.083
We don't want any problem.

02:03:26.166 --> 02:03:27.833
We just think that he should...

02:03:28.875 --> 02:03:30.666
maybe enjoy his grandchildren,

02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:33.208
"enjoy his pension, enjoy his life as is."

02:03:33.291 --> 02:03:34.875
Go no further, Frank.

02:03:36.791 --> 02:03:37.666
Who said it?

02:03:39.125 --> 02:03:41.958
- It don't matter who said it.
- Oh, it matters.

02:03:42.041 --> 02:03:43.791
- Was it Russell? No.
- No.

02:03:43.875 --> 02:03:46.583
Of course it's not Russell.
It's that little cocksucker

02:03:46.666 --> 02:03:48.625
from the Miami fiasco?

02:03:48.708 --> 02:03:49.833
- No?
- No.

02:03:49.916 --> 02:03:51.666
Not him. No?

02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:52.666
Then who?

02:03:55.333 --> 02:03:56.750
I'm gonna tell you.

02:03:56.833 --> 02:03:57.958
Tony.

02:03:58.041 --> 02:03:58.958
Tony?

02:03:59.708 --> 02:04:01.000
Which Tony?

02:04:01.083 --> 02:04:03.083
They're all named Tony.

02:04:03.166 --> 02:04:05.125
I mean, what's the matter with Italians?

02:04:05.208 --> 02:04:07.666
They can only think of one name.

02:04:08.666 --> 02:04:09.625
The other Tony.

02:04:11.583 --> 02:04:12.625
What Tony?

02:04:15.583 --> 02:04:16.666
Salerno.

02:04:25.375 --> 02:04:26.916
Well, what can I say?

02:04:28.958 --> 02:04:30.125
Jimmy, I'm trying to help you.

02:04:30.208 --> 02:04:32.583
- I'm trying to tell you something.
- I know you are.

02:04:32.666 --> 02:04:35.208
Frank, don't even think about it.

02:04:35.833 --> 02:04:37.333
I don't keep my mouth shut...

02:04:37.416 --> 02:04:38.750
- I know that.
- for anyone.

02:04:38.833 --> 02:04:42.333
I know that, you know that,
they don't know that.

02:04:44.083 --> 02:04:47.541
That's who I am, that's what I am
and that's what I'm gonna do.

02:04:49.291 --> 02:04:50.791
Somebody can tell him that.

02:04:50.875 --> 02:04:52.166
He said that?

02:04:52.958 --> 02:04:54.166
In so many words, you know.

02:04:54.250 --> 02:04:56.291
Well, before he says something like that,

02:04:56.375 --> 02:04:58.000
he should remember
that Joe Gallo liked to make

02:04:58.083 --> 02:04:59.791
a lot of fucking noise, too.

02:04:59.875 --> 02:05:01.416
Somebody should tell him that.

02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:02.791
Who said?

02:05:04.333 --> 02:05:05.708
- Tony.
- He said that?

02:05:05.791 --> 02:05:08.166
Oh, that's it. That does it.

02:05:09.625 --> 02:05:11.333
I'm never gonna retire now.

02:05:12.583 --> 02:05:13.958
Somebody can tell him that.

02:05:14.041 --> 02:05:15.666
Jimmy, I did tell him.
I told him over and over.

02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:18.375
All right, you told him.
Let's stop this, then. Forget it.

02:05:18.458 --> 02:05:19.666
Enough.

02:05:20.416 --> 02:05:22.208
Let me enjoy my ice cream here.

02:05:27.833 --> 02:05:28.791
What's the matter?

02:05:29.458 --> 02:05:30.708
Nothing.

02:05:30.791 --> 02:05:31.666
What?

02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:33.000
- Oh, nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

02:05:33.083 --> 02:05:34.708
Come on, you're thinking something. What?

02:05:35.458 --> 02:05:37.041
I just...

02:05:38.250 --> 02:05:39.958
What? Come on. What are you doing?

02:05:40.041 --> 02:05:42.000
- It ain't the right time.
- What do you mean?

02:05:42.083 --> 02:05:43.833
It is the right time.
What isn't the right time?

02:05:43.916 --> 02:05:45.041
Say it.

02:05:47.083 --> 02:05:49.041
Uh, the Local's putting together

02:05:49.125 --> 02:05:51.666
a testimonial dinner for me and...

02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:53.666
A testimonial dinner for you, that's good.

02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:55.791
Yeah. But later... Later, when...

02:05:56.375 --> 02:05:57.291
What's the matter?

02:06:01.708 --> 02:06:04.291
Uh, I was gonna ask you if you would...

02:06:04.375 --> 02:06:06.000
present the award to me.

02:06:07.291 --> 02:06:08.416
Well...

02:06:09.250 --> 02:06:10.791
That's nice of you, Frank.

02:06:10.875 --> 02:06:13.208
Really. That's nice of you.
And, you know...

02:06:13.791 --> 02:06:14.833
Who's gonna be there?

02:06:14.916 --> 02:06:17.541
- Everybody.
- Tony.

02:06:18.375 --> 02:06:21.708
Tony, Tony, Tony, and Tony, huh?

02:06:21.791 --> 02:06:24.708
Everybody from Downtown.

02:06:25.791 --> 02:06:28.250
Nah. Nah, it ain't a good idea.
Everybody's gonna be there.

02:06:28.333 --> 02:06:31.041
People... You're gonna be uncomfortable.

02:06:31.125 --> 02:06:34.208
I don't give a fuck who's there.

02:06:34.291 --> 02:06:35.708
We gonna let those cocksuckers

02:06:35.791 --> 02:06:38.791
keep me from your big night?
There's no way.

02:06:38.875 --> 02:06:40.000
No.

02:06:40.083 --> 02:06:43.833
I'm gonna be there.
And I'll be honored to be there.

02:06:43.916 --> 02:06:45.125
You deserve this.

02:06:45.208 --> 02:06:47.041
- Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:06:50.291 --> 02:06:52.750
- Ooh, that Mo Dean.
- Yeah.

02:06:53.541 --> 02:06:55.250
- She's a good-looking broad.
- She's nice.

02:06:55.333 --> 02:06:56.750
<i>I did not realize</i>

02:06:56.833 --> 02:06:58.791
<i>that Mr. Howard Hunt
worked most of the time</i>

02:06:58.875 --> 02:07:01.916
<i>while he was at the White House
in the plumbers unit until after June...</i>

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.166
He's a rat, but that's, you know...

02:07:04.250 --> 02:07:05.708
He's a rat. But he's a smart rat.

02:07:08.583 --> 02:07:10.625
We've got a great crowd

02:07:10.708 --> 02:07:12.625
for Frank tonight, huh?
Come on. Give it up.

02:07:16.041 --> 02:07:20.125
That's because Frank is a man
with a lot of friends.

02:07:22.291 --> 02:07:25.166
From his war buddies
who fought with him in Italy

02:07:25.250 --> 02:07:27.583
under General George Patton...

02:07:29.083 --> 02:07:32.250
to the drivers, national organizers,

02:07:32.333 --> 02:07:35.125
business agents, local presidents,

02:07:35.208 --> 02:07:38.791
joint committee chairmen,
and regional trustees,

02:07:38.875 --> 02:07:41.083
we are all friends

02:07:41.166 --> 02:07:42.958
of Frank's tonight.

02:07:43.041 --> 02:07:44.500
Friends of Frank.

02:07:46.416 --> 02:07:49.250
Like NAACP president Cecil Moore.

02:07:50.791 --> 02:07:52.958
District Attorney Emmett Fitzpatrick.

02:07:54.416 --> 02:07:56.583
Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo.

02:07:58.208 --> 02:08:00.041
Hey, they like you, Frank.

02:08:00.791 --> 02:08:02.958
And, of course, our featured speaker,

02:08:03.041 --> 02:08:04.750
James Riddell Hoffa.

02:08:12.416 --> 02:08:14.583
And meanwhile, outside in the trees,

02:08:14.666 --> 02:08:16.291
we got the FBI.

02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:19.041
Somebody wanna check on them?

02:08:21.208 --> 02:08:23.083
Now, let me tell you
about the first time I met Frank.

02:08:23.166 --> 02:08:24.916
He took me out to a steak dinner,

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.458
and he asked me, he said,
"How do you like your steak?"

02:08:27.541 --> 02:08:29.416
I said, "I like it rare."
He said, "Me too."

02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:31.583
Well, they bring out the steaks.
Mine's rare.

02:08:31.666 --> 02:08:33.500
Frank's was still walking
from the kitchen.

02:08:35.458 --> 02:08:37.458
He turns to me, he said, "Well, you know",

02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:39.500
I'm an animal lover.
I don't wanna hurt it."

02:08:41.875 --> 02:08:42.875
He's an animal lover.

02:08:46.458 --> 02:08:47.458
Oh.

02:09:07.416 --> 02:09:11.166
This guy is not even the goddamn president
and he's holding up people's loans.

02:09:12.125 --> 02:09:13.875
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

02:09:14.375 --> 02:09:15.583
And how's he supposed to do that?

02:09:15.666 --> 02:09:16.791
Because his guys
are holding 'em back loans

02:09:16.875 --> 02:09:19.125
on Carlos's new hotel in New Orleans,

02:09:19.208 --> 02:09:21.166
the add-on that we're doing at Caesars.

02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:28.125
- And what's Fitz doing all this time?
- Fitz?

02:09:28.208 --> 02:09:29.958
Yeah, he's supposed to help
with this shit.

02:09:30.041 --> 02:09:32.041
The money comes
from the Pension Fund trustees.

02:09:32.125 --> 02:09:33.708
They gotta sign off on it.

02:09:33.791 --> 02:09:35.875
They're supposed to be rubber-stamping
what Fitz says.

02:09:35.958 --> 02:09:38.250
- Right, right. Yeah.
- Except Jimmy

02:09:38.333 --> 02:09:40.583
has a couple of them
to stop rubber-stamping.

02:09:42.666 --> 02:09:44.541
The son of a bitch.

02:09:44.625 --> 02:09:46.041
I thought we took care of that.

02:09:47.583 --> 02:09:48.833
You know
what he told somebody?

02:09:48.916 --> 02:09:50.958
He goes, once Fitz is out and he's in,

02:09:51.041 --> 02:09:53.125
he's gonna call in the old loans.

02:09:53.208 --> 02:09:56.875
Hotels, casinos, real estate,
no matter what it is.

02:09:56.958 --> 02:09:59.125
And if you don't have his money
and interest in two seconds,

02:09:59.208 --> 02:10:00.416
he's taking 'em over.

02:10:01.041 --> 02:10:02.000
We can't have that.

02:10:04.791 --> 02:10:06.708
- He said that?
- He said that.

02:10:06.791 --> 02:10:08.208
You sure he said that, Tony?

02:10:08.291 --> 02:10:09.791
He said that.

02:10:09.875 --> 02:10:11.791
Everything I'm telling you, yeah, he said.

02:10:11.875 --> 02:10:13.958
I mean, who does he think he is? Castro?

You don't need money, do you?

02:10:41.041 --> 02:10:42.125
It's not about money.

02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:43.958
Oh, if it's not about money,

02:10:44.041 --> 02:10:45.833
then I'm really having
trouble understanding,

02:10:45.916 --> 02:10:47.833
because I don't know
what all the talk is about.

02:10:48.583 --> 02:10:49.750
It's my union.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.625
- Is that hard to understand?
- No, no.

02:10:52.708 --> 02:10:55.416
It's your union, that's right.
It'll always be your union.

02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:57.291
You could step down and still run it.

02:10:57.375 --> 02:10:59.291
No, you don't step down.
What do you mean?

02:10:59.375 --> 02:11:01.458
Russ, you don't step down
to run a union.

02:11:01.541 --> 02:11:02.875
You step down to go to your grave.

02:11:03.416 --> 02:11:05.000
Well, listen.

02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:08.125
I still think...
I can't help but think, I'm sorry,

02:11:08.208 --> 02:11:10.291
but is there another reason or something?

02:11:10.375 --> 02:11:13.166
This is my union!
What do you mean, "another reason"?

02:11:14.625 --> 02:11:16.166
This is my union.

02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:19.833
All right? Let's start with that
and then try to understand things.

02:11:19.916 --> 02:11:21.833
Listen, some people,

02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:25.333
not me, but some people,

02:11:25.958 --> 02:11:27.458
they're a little concerned.

02:11:28.250 --> 02:11:30.708
Some people, not me,
they think that you might...

02:11:31.666 --> 02:11:32.750
I might...

02:11:32.833 --> 02:11:36.875
You might be demonstrating
a failure to show appreciation.

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:41.000
I'm not showing appreciation?

02:11:42.041 --> 02:11:43.958
According to, you know, some people.

02:11:44.041 --> 02:11:46.916
I went to school for five fucking years.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.500
- Yes, you did.
- Five fucking years.

02:11:51.041 --> 02:11:53.041
I didn't name one fucking name.

02:11:53.125 --> 02:11:54.666
- You did the right thing.
- I did the right thing.

02:11:54.750 --> 02:11:55.625
You did the right thing.

02:11:55.708 --> 02:11:57.500
I sat there every day with that

02:11:57.583 --> 02:12:01.750
whining cocksucker from New Jersey,
talking to me

02:12:01.833 --> 02:12:04.416
about his woes, his problems,

02:12:05.333 --> 02:12:08.000
and all I wanted to do
was finish my ice cream in peace.

02:12:09.625 --> 02:12:10.625
This cocksucker

02:12:10.708 --> 02:12:14.125
shows up at a meeting 15 minutes late,

02:12:14.916 --> 02:12:16.625
wearing fucking shorts!

02:12:17.625 --> 02:12:20.083
- Who wears shorts to a meeting?
- Nobody.

02:12:20.166 --> 02:12:21.625
- That's right.
- Nobody.

02:12:22.541 --> 02:12:24.250
I'm not showing appreciation?

02:12:24.333 --> 02:12:25.166
It's not me.

02:12:25.875 --> 02:12:26.875
According to some people...

02:12:26.958 --> 02:12:29.166
No, I know it's not you. Some people...

02:12:29.708 --> 02:12:32.083
Some people say
I'm not showing appreciation?

02:12:32.166 --> 02:12:33.458
Well, then fuck them.

02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:35.791
I'm trying to help you, Jim.

02:12:35.875 --> 02:12:36.875
I know you are.

02:12:37.583 --> 02:12:39.541
But nobody threatens Hoffa.

02:12:39.625 --> 02:12:41.666

02:13:01.375 --> 02:13:03.708
He has done it as a driver,

02:13:03.791 --> 02:13:06.125
he has done it as an organizer,

02:13:06.208 --> 02:13:08.958
and I don't think
many of you here know this,

02:13:09.041 --> 02:13:11.583
but Frank holds a record.

02:13:12.458 --> 02:13:16.166
It's most arrests on the picket line.

02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:20.291
Twenty-six times

02:13:20.375 --> 02:13:23.625
in 24 hours, beating my record.

02:13:26.041 --> 02:13:29.500
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
There's no exaggeration.

02:13:31.083 --> 02:13:32.791
He is a union man

02:13:32.875 --> 02:13:35.666
to his bones.

02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:37.291
Which side are you on?

02:13:37.375 --> 02:13:38.833
Your side!

02:13:38.916 --> 02:13:39.916
Whose side?

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Your side!

02:13:41.083 --> 02:13:42.125
My side.

02:13:42.208 --> 02:13:43.125
Your side.

02:13:43.208 --> 02:13:44.875
- His side.
- Yeah!

02:13:44.958 --> 02:13:46.208
There it is.

02:13:46.958 --> 02:13:50.541
And so, it is an honor for me
to be here tonight

02:13:50.625 --> 02:13:52.416
to present this award

02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:54.666
to my dear friend,

02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:56.916
Mr. Frank Sheeran!

02:14:06.458 --> 02:14:08.708
Thank you, Jimmy, thank you so much.

02:14:09.666 --> 02:14:12.125
And thank you to my lovely wife Reenie

02:14:12.208 --> 02:14:14.583
for being here with me.

02:14:14.666 --> 02:14:17.333
My lovely, sweet, adorable daughters,

02:14:17.416 --> 02:14:18.833
Maryanne,

02:14:18.916 --> 02:14:20.541
Dolores, Connie,

02:14:20.625 --> 02:14:22.916
Peggy, for putting up with me

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.666
for all these years.

02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:28.791
And, Jimmy, I can't tell you
what this means to me

02:14:28.875 --> 02:14:30.166
to get this honor from you.

02:14:30.958 --> 02:14:34.208
It's the highlight of my life.
Thank you very, very much.

02:14:34.291 --> 02:14:37.541
And this man, James Riddell Hoffa,

02:14:38.291 --> 02:14:40.541
is the guy that gets the job done.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.750
I'm behind you, Jimmy.

02:14:44.833 --> 02:14:45.875
All the way.

02:14:47.791 --> 02:14:49.000
In any case,

02:14:49.083 --> 02:14:51.458
from the deepest part of my heart,
I thank you all.

02:14:51.541 --> 02:14:53.333
'Cause I don't really deserve all this.

02:14:54.458 --> 02:14:57.125
But I have bursitis
and I don't deserve that either.

02:14:58.916 --> 02:15:01.208
Thank you all tonight
and thank you for coming.

02:15:01.291 --> 02:15:02.291
Good night.

02:15:13.625 --> 02:15:15.333
What happened to "Say cheese"?

02:15:15.916 --> 02:15:16.833
Cheese!

02:16:32.708 --> 02:16:35.415
Only three people
in the world have one of these.

02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:37.875
And only one of them is Irish.

02:16:37.958 --> 02:16:39.375
I have one.

02:16:39.458 --> 02:16:40.790
Angelo has one.

02:16:43.333 --> 02:16:44.458
Now you have one.

02:16:49.333 --> 02:16:50.500
This is beautiful.

02:16:54.583 --> 02:16:57.250
I... I don't...
I don't know what to say, Russ. It's...

02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:00.125
Slip it on. See how it looks.

02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:05.915
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.958
You know how strong I made you?
You know how strong?

02:17:12.708 --> 02:17:13.833
You're my kid.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.415
Nobody... Nobody can fuck with you.

02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:18.583
Nobody.

02:17:44.333 --> 02:17:45.875
Listen, Frank.

02:17:46.665 --> 02:17:49.750
Things have gotten out of hand
with our friend again.

02:17:50.915 --> 02:17:54.208
And some people are having
serious problems with him.

02:17:55.083 --> 02:17:57.708
And, uh, it's at a point where

02:17:57.790 --> 02:18:00.333
you're gonna have to talk to him
and tell him

02:18:01.333 --> 02:18:02.833
it's what it is.

02:18:05.540 --> 02:18:06.625
What it is?

02:18:06.708 --> 02:18:08.708
Yes. It's what they want.

02:18:09.290 --> 02:18:10.540
It's where it's gotten.

02:18:12.125 --> 02:18:14.875
You're close to him.
Maybe he'll listen to you.

02:18:14.958 --> 02:18:16.375
You know I talked to him.

02:18:16.458 --> 02:18:18.458
He's a tough guy to talk to.
You know him.

02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:20.125
He has no choice.

02:18:20.208 --> 02:18:21.750
He has no choice.

02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:23.875
These are the higher-ups.

02:18:25.875 --> 02:18:28.040
Well, he's a higher-up too.
I mean... No?

02:18:29.165 --> 02:18:30.875
Not like this. You know that.

02:18:30.958 --> 02:18:32.665
Oh, come on now, Frank.

02:18:35.875 --> 02:18:37.915
If they can whack a president,

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:39.833
they can whack a president of the union.

02:18:41.833 --> 02:18:44.333
You know it and I know it.

02:18:54.708 --> 02:18:56.500
I talk to this guy,
I talk to him, I talk to him,

02:18:56.583 --> 02:18:58.040
I talk to him, he don't listen.

02:18:58.125 --> 02:19:00.458
But he's gotta listen now.
I gotta make him listen.

02:19:02.833 --> 02:19:06.000
That ain't right. He's...
He's a fucking knucklehead.

02:19:17.083 --> 02:19:18.083
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

02:19:18.165 --> 02:19:19.790
I talked to Russ.

02:19:19.875 --> 02:19:21.083
He talked to Tony.

02:19:21.165 --> 02:19:22.375
He means what he's saying.

02:19:23.375 --> 02:19:25.333
- Who? Russ?
- No, Tony.

02:19:25.415 --> 02:19:26.540
- Tony?
- Yeah.

02:19:27.415 --> 02:19:28.875
Well, I mean what I'm saying.

02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:33.500
He can't seem to get that
through his fat, fucking Sicilian head.

02:19:33.583 --> 02:19:35.333
Can he? Don't worry about it.

02:19:35.415 --> 02:19:36.665
What's the matter with you?

02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:38.165
You... You look...

02:19:38.250 --> 02:19:39.208
- I'm concerned.
- Yeah, I know.

02:19:39.290 --> 02:19:41.333
You look concerned.
What are you concerned about?

02:19:41.415 --> 02:19:42.290
I'm... I'm...

02:19:42.375 --> 02:19:43.833
They should be concerned.

02:19:43.915 --> 02:19:45.333
- They are. They are.
- Well, let them be.

02:19:45.415 --> 02:19:48.500
They're more than a little concerned.
There's widespread concern.

02:19:48.583 --> 02:19:49.833
It's a big problem.

02:19:51.333 --> 02:19:54.916
Tony told the old man
to tell me to tell you...

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.833
- Hmm.
- "It's what it is."

02:20:01.125 --> 02:20:02.000
What it is?

02:20:02.083 --> 02:20:03.166
It's what it is.

02:20:07.166 --> 02:20:08.416
Please, listen to me.

02:20:10.666 --> 02:20:12.500
They wouldn't dare.

02:20:12.583 --> 02:20:14.333
- Don't...
- They wouldn't dare.

02:20:14.416 --> 02:20:16.250
- Jimmy...
- Please, Frank, come on.

02:20:16.333 --> 02:20:18.000
- Don't say they wouldn't dare.
- No.

02:20:18.083 --> 02:20:21.208
Don't... Don't tell me that kinda...
That's fairy tales.

02:20:21.291 --> 02:20:22.958
No, don't say they wouldn't dare.

02:20:23.541 --> 02:20:26.166
If something funny happens to me...

02:20:28.250 --> 02:20:29.208
they're done.

02:20:29.291 --> 02:20:31.166
You understand that? And they know it.

02:20:31.250 --> 02:20:33.833
Because I got files. I got proof.

02:20:33.916 --> 02:20:34.958
I got records.

02:20:35.041 --> 02:20:38.166
I got tapes.
Any time I want, they'll be gone.

02:20:38.250 --> 02:20:39.541
These Guinea motherfuckers

02:20:39.625 --> 02:20:41.916
will spend
the rest of their lives in jail,

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.583
and they know it.

02:20:44.375 --> 02:20:45.250
They know it.

02:20:45.333 --> 02:20:47.416
But what you're saying
is what they're concerned about.

02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:49.083
What I'm saying is I know things.

02:20:49.166 --> 02:20:52.166
I know things they don't know I know.

02:20:52.958 --> 02:20:55.125
- Please...
- Are you gonna take that chance?

02:20:55.208 --> 02:20:57.041
What chance am I...
Why should I be taking a chance?

02:20:57.125 --> 02:20:58.541
They're saying this is it.

02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:01.083
They're saying this is it,
and then it's it?

02:21:01.166 --> 02:21:03.583
Bullshit. Bullshit, Frank. Come on.

02:21:03.666 --> 02:21:05.083
Jimmy, I'm trying to tell you something.

02:21:05.166 --> 02:21:07.375
I know you are. You're telling me
that they're threatening me

02:21:07.458 --> 02:21:08.875
and I gotta do what they say.

02:21:08.958 --> 02:21:11.875
It's more than a threat.
It's the bottom line.

02:21:11.958 --> 02:21:12.875
The bottom line.

02:21:13.791 --> 02:21:14.958
It's what it is.

02:21:15.041 --> 02:21:17.541
They do something to me,
I do something to them.

02:21:18.708 --> 02:21:20.541
That's all I know.
I don't know anything else. Do you?

02:21:23.625 --> 02:21:25.666
So what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna tell McGee?

02:21:26.625 --> 02:21:28.125
That you're not gonna listen?

02:21:28.208 --> 02:21:29.375
He ain't used to people
not listening to him.

02:21:29.458 --> 02:21:30.458
Well, neither am I.

02:21:32.125 --> 02:21:34.000
- What?
- Neither am I.

02:21:34.083 --> 02:21:35.750
Then I don't know what to do.

02:21:35.833 --> 02:21:37.541
I mean, maybe you should
get some bodies around you

02:21:37.625 --> 02:21:39.541
- for protection.
- Oh, come on. Please.

02:21:39.625 --> 02:21:41.208
I'm not gonna go that route.

02:21:41.291 --> 02:21:42.833
Don't do this to me, Frank.

02:21:42.916 --> 02:21:45.375
What do you mean, "bodies around me"?
I don't need...

02:21:45.458 --> 02:21:47.833
You put bodies around you,
then they go after your family.

02:21:47.916 --> 02:21:50.166
- It doesn't matter. You worried?
- I'm worried.

02:21:50.250 --> 02:21:52.333
Get some bodies around you.
I'll tell you why.

02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:55.083
This could happen to you.

02:21:55.166 --> 02:21:56.833
They could come after you

02:21:57.416 --> 02:21:59.208
since you're with me.

02:21:59.291 --> 02:22:00.166
No?

02:22:02.791 --> 02:22:04.375
I'm worried.

02:22:04.458 --> 02:22:06.208
Tell Russ I got nothing
but respect for him.

02:22:06.916 --> 02:22:09.375
I got a little trouble with him.

02:22:09.458 --> 02:22:11.625
We were talking before
and I just got a little crazy.

02:22:11.708 --> 02:22:13.583
You know how I am. I just blow.

02:22:13.666 --> 02:22:14.791
- Sometimes.
- Yeah.

02:22:14.875 --> 02:22:16.208
I just walked away like that.

02:22:16.291 --> 02:22:18.291
But I get that way. I get abrupt.

02:22:18.375 --> 02:22:20.750
Maybe you could tell him
how much I respect him.

02:22:21.625 --> 02:22:23.333
I have nothing but respect for this guy.

02:22:24.166 --> 02:22:25.666
I would never hurt him,

02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:28.708
no matter what I do with files,
or whatever I do with anything.

02:22:28.791 --> 02:22:31.250
But you should tell him. Yourself.

02:22:31.333 --> 02:22:32.208
No, I'm not gonna tell him myself.

02:22:32.291 --> 02:22:33.541
- Please.
- Oh, come on.

02:22:33.625 --> 02:22:35.583
- It would go a long way.
- He's your rabbi.

02:22:36.333 --> 02:22:38.250
Because of him, you're here.

02:22:38.333 --> 02:22:39.250
You tell him.

02:22:40.125 --> 02:22:41.083
Listen to me.

02:22:41.166 --> 02:22:43.708
At the end,
there's only one thing that's real.

02:22:44.791 --> 02:22:46.541
This is my union.

02:22:48.375 --> 02:22:51.375
This is my union, Frank.

02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:55.541
Very simple when you say it that way.

02:23:01.083 --> 02:23:02.375
Peggy!

02:23:02.458 --> 02:23:04.000
Shall we dance?

02:23:04.083 --> 02:23:05.416
Excuse us.

02:23:37.250 --> 02:23:39.416
<i>A couple of hours outside Detroit,</i>

02:23:39.500 --> 02:23:41.833
<i>we figured we'd spend the night,</i>

02:23:41.916 --> 02:23:43.750
<i>drive up in the morning.</i>

02:23:43.833 --> 02:23:45.291
<i>I mean, the wedding, that was the thing.</i>

02:23:46.291 --> 02:23:50.208
<i>Bill Bufalino was giving
his daughter away to a hell of a guy.</i>

02:23:50.291 --> 02:23:52.750
<i>Better than the bum she was with before.</i>

02:23:52.833 --> 02:23:54.416
<i>And that was all well and good.</i>

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.291
<i>But the wedding
was really a peace mission.</i>

02:23:59.458 --> 02:24:00.666
<i>And that's what we were there for.</i>

02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:02.541
<i>And everybody kinda knew that,</i>

02:24:02.625 --> 02:24:04.541
<i>and we were there
to straighten it all out.</i>

02:24:05.166 --> 02:24:06.750
- Hey, Jimmy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

02:24:06.833 --> 02:24:08.375
I'm with the old man, we're driving up.

02:24:08.458 --> 02:24:11.000
<i>He hopes we can straighten
this whole thing out.</i>

02:24:11.083 --> 02:24:12.750
- What did he say?
<i>- He said he hopes</i>

02:24:12.833 --> 02:24:14.166
we can straighten it out.
After the wedding,

02:24:14.250 --> 02:24:16.250
we sit down, we talk,
we straighten it out.

02:24:16.333 --> 02:24:17.458
<i>Right, the wedding.</i>

02:24:17.541 --> 02:24:18.916
I'm not going to the wedding.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.125
Too many people I don't like
are gonna be there,

02:24:21.208 --> 02:24:22.583
<i>so I'm not going to the wedding.</i>

02:24:22.666 --> 02:24:24.166
You're not going to the wedding?

02:24:24.250 --> 02:24:25.666
I'm not gonna be there.

02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:28.916
Well, then we could...

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:30.500
Jimmy, then we could do it
anywhere you want.

02:24:30.583 --> 02:24:32.666
We can do it at your house.

02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:34.041
We can do it anywhere you want.

02:24:34.125 --> 02:24:35.166
<i>Wherever you're comfortable.</i>

02:24:36.333 --> 02:24:37.291
The lake?

02:24:37.375 --> 02:24:39.666
Yeah, the lake.
You wanna do it at the lake?

02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:43.625
Oh, from day one,
I wanted to work this out.

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:46.750
- I know. I know.
- From day fucking one.

02:24:46.833 --> 02:24:49.416
I know. Nobody knows better than me.
I know that.

02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:50.666
<i>All right, uh...</i>

02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:52.583
Just you two, right?

02:24:52.666 --> 02:24:54.500
I mean, not the Little Guy.

02:24:54.583 --> 02:24:56.291
- No, of course, the Little Guy.
<i>- No.</i>

02:24:56.375 --> 02:24:58.416
I'm not doing it with him.

02:24:58.500 --> 02:24:59.833
Jimmy, there's no point
just the three of us.

02:24:59.916 --> 02:25:01.041
No, no. No, no.

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:03.333
Just the three of us.
That's the way it's...

02:25:03.416 --> 02:25:04.958
There's no point just the three of us.

02:25:05.041 --> 02:25:06.291
It's gotta be the Little Guy with us.

02:25:06.375 --> 02:25:08.833
No, I'm not sitting down
with that little cocksucker again!

02:25:08.916 --> 02:25:11.375
Do you understand? I can't do it, Frank!

02:25:11.458 --> 02:25:13.375
You have to.
No, Jimmy, you gotta sit down with him.

02:25:13.458 --> 02:25:14.458
<i>We don't gotta do anything.</i>

02:25:14.541 --> 02:25:16.708
This is a courtesy with these people.

02:25:16.791 --> 02:25:18.125
A complete courtesy.

02:25:18.208 --> 02:25:19.500
- You know that.
<i>- I understand.</i>

02:25:19.583 --> 02:25:21.166
But you gotta try and move past that.

02:25:21.250 --> 02:25:22.833
Get past it? I am past it!

02:25:22.916 --> 02:25:24.958
I'm never seeing that motherfucker again.

02:25:25.041 --> 02:25:27.375
Jimmy, you gotta sit down.
Everybody says so.

02:25:27.458 --> 02:25:29.833
But there's no point.
There's only one point,

02:25:29.916 --> 02:25:31.916
I don't wanna do it
and I'm not gonna do it.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.500
Frank, I'm gonna hang up on you now.

02:25:33.583 --> 02:25:35.583
Please. Understand this. Okay?

02:25:49.416 --> 02:25:52.041
- What did he say?
- Uh, he's thinking about it.

02:25:52.666 --> 02:25:54.750
- Thinking about it?
- Yeah.

02:26:01.791 --> 02:26:02.625
That's for you.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.166
Well, that's good. Okay.

02:26:25.625 --> 02:26:26.583
What time you got, Frank?

02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:29.333
Uh, about five.

02:26:29.416 --> 02:26:30.500
Five, huh?

02:26:33.083 --> 02:26:34.666
Maybe you should give Jimmy a call.

02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:36.750
I mean, he said
he was gonna think about it, right?

02:26:43.083 --> 02:26:43.916
Okay.

02:26:55.166 --> 02:26:56.625
So when are you getting in?

02:26:56.708 --> 02:26:58.000
Uh, tomorrow morning.

02:26:58.083 --> 02:26:59.958
<i>Oh, that's good.
That's good, 'cause, uh...</i>

02:27:00.541 --> 02:27:02.875
I changed my mind about the other thing.

02:27:04.375 --> 02:27:06.166
- You did?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

02:27:06.250 --> 02:27:09.500
Yeah, I'm gonna meet, uh,
with the Little Guy tomorrow afternoon.

02:27:10.541 --> 02:27:11.625
With the lit...

02:27:11.708 --> 02:27:12.916
- With the Little Guy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.833
Uh, Tony Jack set it up. I like Jack.

02:27:15.916 --> 02:27:17.750
<i>Jack's good. I met with him a few times</i>

02:27:17.833 --> 02:27:19.625
after that, you know, Miami fiasco.

02:27:20.208 --> 02:27:21.708
With the Little Guy. Where?

02:27:22.666 --> 02:27:25.750
Same place as before.
You know where it is.

02:27:25.833 --> 02:27:27.000
In public.

02:27:28.833 --> 02:27:30.500
You know Tony Jack is Pro's cousin?

02:27:31.291 --> 02:27:32.791
Yeah. So?

02:27:32.875 --> 02:27:34.458
They're all fucking cousins.
What're you gonna do?

02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:37.166
Jimmy, I think I should be there.

02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:38.583
Oh, yeah, I want you there.

02:27:38.666 --> 02:27:41.083
That's why I asked
when you're coming in.

02:27:41.166 --> 02:27:42.291
What time's the meeting?

02:27:42.375 --> 02:27:43.291
<i>Two-thirty.</i>

02:27:43.375 --> 02:27:45.875
And he better not be late,
that cocksucker,

02:27:45.958 --> 02:27:47.916
or wearing those fucking shorts.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:51.333
Listen, I'm gonna get there at 2:00,
so you should get there at 2:00.

02:27:51.416 --> 02:27:52.625
- Okay?
<i>- I'll be there at 2:00.</i>

02:27:52.708 --> 02:27:55.000
Oh, good. Good. Okay.

02:27:55.083 --> 02:27:56.291
I'll see you at 2:00.

02:27:56.375 --> 02:27:57.708
<i>- Thanks, Frank.</i>
- Okay, Jimmy.

02:27:59.458 --> 02:28:00.333
See you at 2:00.

02:28:06.958 --> 02:28:07.916
What did he say?

02:28:08.833 --> 02:28:09.791
He's gonna meet with Pro.

02:28:12.291 --> 02:28:13.333
Tony Jack set it up.

02:28:14.250 --> 02:28:15.333
Very good.

02:28:29.916 --> 02:28:32.333
- Hello.
- Hello. Good evening.

02:28:33.375 --> 02:28:35.458
- We're starving.
- Oh, let's go, let's go.

02:28:42.083 --> 02:28:43.250
It was the best move we made,

02:28:43.333 --> 02:28:45.833
getting this red wine vinegar
from Angelo's guy.

02:28:48.208 --> 02:28:49.500
Great Italian olive oil

02:28:49.583 --> 02:28:52.125
we got from that other mooch
was not bad either.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.333
Catania olives, what better.

02:28:56.416 --> 02:28:57.333
The best.

02:29:02.208 --> 02:29:03.833
There's been a change.

02:29:04.416 --> 02:29:05.541
Instead of, uh,

02:29:07.250 --> 02:29:08.791
going up early,
we're gonna hang around

02:29:08.875 --> 02:29:11.208
tomorrow morning and then go drive up.

02:29:12.166 --> 02:29:15.708
But... But I told Jimmy
that we were gonna be up in the morning.

02:29:17.375 --> 02:29:18.291
I told Jimmy...

02:29:18.375 --> 02:29:20.541
I told Jimmy we're gonna be
up in the morning.

02:29:20.625 --> 02:29:22.166
I know. I know.

02:29:24.333 --> 02:29:27.875
That I would be there for that...
meeting with Pro.

02:29:27.958 --> 02:29:29.416
- What?
- That I'd be...

02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:31.625
be there for that meeting with Pro.

02:29:31.708 --> 02:29:32.833
Oh, yeah. I know. I know.

02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:39.458
But what I... What am I gonna do?

02:29:41.833 --> 02:29:43.541
We gotta go there. I mean, I gotta go.

02:29:43.625 --> 02:29:45.000
I told him I'd be there.

02:29:48.583 --> 02:29:49.666
Frank...

02:29:50.541 --> 02:29:52.458
we did all we could for the man.

02:30:04.125 --> 02:30:05.208
Don't call him.

02:30:41.625 --> 02:30:43.958
- Hey. Good morning.
- Hey. Morning.

02:30:47.083 --> 02:30:48.583
Want some coffee?

02:30:48.666 --> 02:30:49.708
No, I got it here.

02:30:51.583 --> 02:30:53.541
- How'd ya sleep?
- Good. You?

02:30:55.458 --> 02:30:56.333
All right.

02:31:00.583 --> 02:31:02.166
Want some Total or Corn Flakes?

02:31:03.041 --> 02:31:04.416
Uh, maybe Total.

02:31:12.708 --> 02:31:13.958
That's good, thanks.

02:31:20.958 --> 02:31:23.208
We're gonna take a ride
up to Port Clinton today.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.250
I thought we were staying here.

02:31:31.791 --> 02:31:33.375
No, the girls are gonna stay here.

02:31:34.375 --> 02:31:36.166
You and me, we're going up and, uh...

02:31:37.833 --> 02:31:39.833
we'll be back three hours tops.

02:31:42.958 --> 02:31:45.833
Oh. But... But what's in Port Clinton?

02:31:46.541 --> 02:31:47.416
A plane.

02:31:51.166 --> 02:31:52.333
A plane? To where?

02:31:53.416 --> 02:31:54.416
Detroit.

02:32:02.166 --> 02:32:03.583
We're going to Detroit now?

02:32:04.333 --> 02:32:06.375
No, you're gonna go to Detroit.

02:32:09.291 --> 02:32:11.166
And when you come back,

02:32:11.250 --> 02:32:12.416
me and you,

02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:16.125
we get together with the girls,
we take a nice slow drive up.

02:32:17.041 --> 02:32:18.708
With cigarette breaks, you know.

02:32:30.375 --> 02:32:31.500
Frank.

02:32:32.125 --> 02:32:34.250
I had to put you into this thing,

02:32:35.041 --> 02:32:36.958
or you would never let it happen.

02:32:37.875 --> 02:32:39.416
And I know you wouldn't.

02:32:45.041 --> 02:32:46.541
But it's gonna happen.

02:32:49.208 --> 02:32:50.916
Either way,

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.125
he's going.

02:32:58.333 --> 02:33:00.666
I know how you feel, Frank. Trust me.

02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:02.291
I know how you feel.

02:33:04.125 --> 02:33:06.583
I told you before,
we tried everything to help him.

02:33:06.666 --> 02:33:07.916
You know that.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.125
You tried.

02:33:12.041 --> 02:33:13.625
He brought this on himself.

02:33:15.958 --> 02:33:17.791
And it's landing on us.

02:33:21.666 --> 02:33:23.166
The only reason they agreed to this

02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:26.375
was out of respect to me.

02:33:29.125 --> 02:33:31.000
But you and Reenie will be okay,

02:33:31.708 --> 02:33:33.125
'cause you're with me.

02:33:38.083 --> 02:33:39.333
You're with me.

02:34:18.666 --> 02:34:19.875
Give me your glasses.

02:38:47.083 --> 02:38:48.000
Hey, Frank.

02:38:49.041 --> 02:38:50.000
Hey, Sal.

02:38:52.333 --> 02:38:54.083
Chuckie's late.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.125
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:39:47.916 --> 02:39:48.833
That him?

02:39:53.333 --> 02:39:54.291
Yeah.

02:39:56.666 --> 02:39:57.958
Jesus.

02:40:02.875 --> 02:40:03.791
I'm Sally.

02:40:04.458 --> 02:40:05.333
Hi.

02:40:07.125 --> 02:40:09.041
- Hey, Chuck.
- Frank.

02:40:09.125 --> 02:40:11.208
Let's go. I don't want your father
yelling at me for being late.

02:40:11.291 --> 02:40:12.500
Frank, you take the front.

02:40:13.916 --> 02:40:15.541
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

02:40:16.291 --> 02:40:17.250
It's wet.

02:40:17.833 --> 02:40:21.708
Yeah, I had a frozen fish
I had to deliver for a friend of mine.

02:40:22.708 --> 02:40:24.041
A fish?

02:40:24.125 --> 02:40:25.416
The seat is wet from a fish?

02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:27.166
Yeah, I know.
What do you want me to do about it now?

02:40:27.250 --> 02:40:28.208
- Jesus Christ.
- I'll sit back there.

02:40:28.291 --> 02:40:29.583
No, no, no, it's all right.
You sit in the front.

02:40:29.666 --> 02:40:31.291
I'll sit there.

02:40:31.375 --> 02:40:32.666
I'll sit here, you take the front.

02:40:32.750 --> 02:40:33.875
No, no.

02:40:33.958 --> 02:40:35.125
I'll sit there.

02:40:38.333 --> 02:40:39.208
- I'm not sitting there.
- Why don't you...

02:40:39.291 --> 02:40:40.291
I'm sitting there.

02:40:42.916 --> 02:40:43.958
All right, sit where you want.

02:40:46.750 --> 02:40:47.958
You want me to get you
a newspaper, Frank?

02:40:48.041 --> 02:40:49.750
It's okay. Let's go.
We gotta hurry.

02:41:04.041 --> 02:41:05.041
What kind of fish?

02:41:07.375 --> 02:41:08.375
What?

02:41:10.708 --> 02:41:11.875
What kind of fish?

02:41:13.375 --> 02:41:16.875
Uh... I don't know.
The kind you eat. A fish.

02:41:18.166 --> 02:41:19.291
You don't know what kind?

02:41:21.416 --> 02:41:22.583
No. I don't.

02:41:23.875 --> 02:41:24.916
Where did you get it?

02:41:26.250 --> 02:41:28.250
What the fuck. At a fish place.

02:41:30.458 --> 02:41:33.750
What, you just go in there and say,
"Gimme a fish"?

02:41:35.083 --> 02:41:36.208
Pretty much. Yeah.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:39.583
You didn't say you want a salmon,

02:41:39.666 --> 02:41:42.208
you want a... haddock, you want a...

02:41:42.833 --> 02:41:43.708
a fucking cod?

02:41:43.791 --> 02:41:46.458
What the fuck does it matter
what kind of fish it was?

02:41:47.250 --> 02:41:48.791
Why are you so concerned
about this fish?

02:41:48.875 --> 02:41:50.291
I'm just trying to understand how...

02:41:50.375 --> 02:41:52.708
Does it...

02:41:53.500 --> 02:41:56.083
How a person can buy a fish
and not know what kind it was.

02:41:58.625 --> 02:42:00.916
There was a fish waiting for me there.

02:42:01.708 --> 02:42:02.708
Uh...

02:42:04.166 --> 02:42:07.416
I didn't ask what kind of fish it was.
I'm sorry.

02:42:11.125 --> 02:42:12.458
So your friend
had already ordered this fish.

02:42:12.541 --> 02:42:13.666
Right.

02:42:20.208 --> 02:42:22.958
'Cause I wanna be able to explain this
if somebody asks me.

02:42:30.250 --> 02:42:31.583
Yeah. Absolutely.

02:42:44.541 --> 02:42:45.375
Dad.

02:42:47.208 --> 02:42:48.208
Chuckie.

02:42:48.291 --> 02:42:50.416
- Yeah, sorry I'm late. I had to drop off...
- Late?

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.666
What the fuck are you even doing here?

02:42:52.750 --> 02:42:54.625
- Who invited you?
- Hey, Jimmy.

02:42:57.333 --> 02:42:58.791
Who the fuck are you?

02:42:58.875 --> 02:43:00.291
I'm with Pro.

02:43:00.375 --> 02:43:01.458
You're with Pro?

02:43:02.083 --> 02:43:04.416
Are you with the cocksucker
who just stood me up?

02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:06.625
I don't wait for anybody
more than ten minutes.

02:43:06.708 --> 02:43:07.916
He's at the house.

02:43:08.625 --> 02:43:09.625
What house?

02:43:09.708 --> 02:43:10.958
With Russ.

02:43:11.791 --> 02:43:14.375
- Russ? What the fuck is...
- Hey, look who's here.

02:43:14.875 --> 02:43:16.375
- Frank.
- Jimmy.

02:43:16.458 --> 02:43:18.208
What the fuck is going on?

02:43:18.833 --> 02:43:20.958
I was waiting for you.
I was there at two o'clock.

02:43:21.041 --> 02:43:22.125
You were supposed to show.
What happened?

02:43:22.208 --> 02:43:25.083
I'm sorry.
But McGee's here, he decided to come.

02:43:25.166 --> 02:43:27.333
But he ain't comfortable here.
He don't wanna come here.

02:43:27.416 --> 02:43:28.416
He's at the house.

02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:30.791
- McGee's in Detroit?
- Yeah, he's here.

02:43:30.875 --> 02:43:32.083
He decided to come.

02:43:33.875 --> 02:43:34.708
Oh.

02:43:34.791 --> 02:43:36.875
Yeah, he came to help
straighten this all out.

02:43:38.458 --> 02:43:39.375
The house?

02:43:45.125 --> 02:43:46.750
We'll bring you back after
to get your car.

02:43:52.750 --> 02:43:53.583
Yeah.

02:43:55.416 --> 02:43:56.250
Okay.

02:43:59.791 --> 02:44:01.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:44:01.791 --> 02:44:03.166
Yeah.

02:44:13.208 --> 02:44:14.291
There was a fish in here,

02:44:14.375 --> 02:44:16.708
but we cleaned it up.

02:44:16.791 --> 02:44:17.625
A fish?

02:44:19.291 --> 02:44:20.958
Chuckie had a fucking fish in here.

02:44:21.041 --> 02:44:21.958
Didn't even know what kind.

02:44:22.041 --> 02:44:24.000
But it's okay now. I wiped it up.

02:44:24.083 --> 02:44:26.958
- I got the handkerchief here.
- Yeah, I can smell it.

02:44:27.041 --> 02:44:27.916
Hey, Chuckie.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:29.708
You had a fish in here in your car?

02:44:29.791 --> 02:44:31.500
For Bobby Holmes.

02:44:31.583 --> 02:44:32.958
You know, Bobby likes fish.

02:44:33.583 --> 02:44:35.041
We cleaned it up, Jimmy. It's all right.

02:44:35.125 --> 02:44:36.416
You cleaned it up?

02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:38.333
- You cleaned it up?
- Yeah.

02:44:38.416 --> 02:44:39.875
What the fuck you know about fish?

02:44:40.583 --> 02:44:42.500
You ever caught
a fucking fish in your life?

02:44:43.375 --> 02:44:44.208
No.

02:44:44.291 --> 02:44:46.041
Well, then you don't know. See?

02:44:46.541 --> 02:44:47.375
Chuck.

02:44:47.458 --> 02:44:50.083
Listen to me.
Never put a fish in your car.

02:44:50.166 --> 02:44:51.583
You never get the smell out.

02:44:51.666 --> 02:44:52.500
No...

02:44:52.583 --> 02:44:53.625
Unless you pack it tight,
you know.

02:44:53.708 --> 02:44:55.250
No, I... I know.

02:44:55.333 --> 02:44:56.916
- You know? Remember that.
- Right.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.000
I know.

02:44:58.083 --> 02:44:59.416
It'll help you in life.

02:45:04.916 --> 02:45:07.666
Frank, you couldn't come by
at 2:00 and tell me this?

02:45:07.750 --> 02:45:10.708
I was waiting there 40 minutes
like a fuckin' moron.

02:45:10.791 --> 02:45:13.541
Jimmy, I'm sorry.
I came as soon as I got here.

02:45:13.625 --> 02:45:15.083
- You got in this morning.
- No, no, no.

02:45:15.166 --> 02:45:16.333
I got here this afternoon.

02:45:16.416 --> 02:45:19.208
Russell had business in Port Clinton.
I had to wait for him.

02:45:19.291 --> 02:45:20.791
He reminded me. I forgot.

02:45:20.875 --> 02:45:23.000
So, we had to come
and as soon as we got here,

02:45:23.083 --> 02:45:24.625
I came right here to see you.

02:45:24.708 --> 02:45:26.791
All due respect to Russ, you know,

02:45:27.833 --> 02:45:30.833
but somebody should have come tell me,
you know.

02:45:30.916 --> 02:45:34.541
Just come tell me it's 2:30,
2:40, at the very least.

02:45:34.625 --> 02:45:35.625
You're not incorrect. I mean...

02:45:35.708 --> 02:45:39.875
Who the fuck is Pro?
He sends a fucking errand boy here.

02:45:39.958 --> 02:45:41.000
Oh, he ain't stayin'.

02:45:41.083 --> 02:45:42.166
I know he ain't staying.

02:45:42.250 --> 02:45:44.333
That's not the point,
he's staying or not staying.

02:45:44.416 --> 02:45:45.875
The point is Pro sent him.

02:45:45.958 --> 02:45:47.250
You know?

02:45:47.333 --> 02:45:48.791
Point is,
he should've come picked me up himself.

02:45:48.875 --> 02:45:50.125
That's the point I'm makin'.

02:45:53.666 --> 02:45:55.416
Can you even see out of those glasses?

02:45:56.916 --> 02:45:58.833
I can't see a fucking thing.

02:45:58.916 --> 02:46:01.208
That's good.
I'm glad you're not driving, then.

02:46:09.791 --> 02:46:11.458
Yeah, it's right... It's right up...

02:46:12.041 --> 02:46:13.916
It's right up here. Right... Right up...

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.041
That building with the staircase.

02:46:17.541 --> 02:46:18.541
You got your friend with you?

02:46:18.625 --> 02:46:20.541
- Right here.
- Good.

02:46:21.458 --> 02:46:23.333
You never know
with this cocksucker,

02:46:23.416 --> 02:46:24.916
with or without Russ there.

02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:06.333

<i>disappeared on Wednesday.</i>

02:49:46.416 --> 02:49:49.166
<i>And as of tonight,
no trace of him has been found.</i>

02:49:49.250 --> 02:49:50.916
<i>Hoffa spent four years...</i>

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:52.291
<i>In prison and made no bones</i>

02:49:52.375 --> 02:49:53.583
<i>- about his intention...</i>
- Frank.

02:49:53.666 --> 02:49:57.041
<i>To get the presidency back
from his successor, Frank Fitzsimmons.</i>

02:49:57.125 --> 02:49:59.166
<i>Fitzsimmons' son
is the vice president of...</i>

02:49:59.250 --> 02:50:01.333
- Still nothing?
- Uh-uh.

02:50:01.416 --> 02:50:04.666
<i>...young Fitzsimmons' car</i>
<i>was bombed. He was not in it.</i>

02:50:04.750 --> 02:50:07.958
<i>But there is bad blood
in the Detroit Local.</i>

02:50:08.041 --> 02:50:10.791
<i>Hoffa disappeared</i>
<i>Wednesday afternoon.</i>

02:50:10.875 --> 02:50:14.333
<i>Now, more than 48 hours later,
with no word yet</i>

02:50:14.416 --> 02:50:18.208
<i>on what happened to Hoffa,
police are extremely concerned.</i>

02:50:18.291 --> 02:50:20.875
<i>Authorities are most anxious
to find whom Hoffa</i>

02:50:20.958 --> 02:50:23.750
<i>was supposed to meet
outside the Red Fox restaurant</i>

02:50:23.833 --> 02:50:25.416
<i>where he was last seen.</i>

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.541
<i>Police think it could have been
a man named Anthony Giacalone,</i>

02:50:29.625 --> 02:50:32.291
<i>described as a big man
in the Detroit Mafia.</i>

02:50:32.375 --> 02:50:35.458
<i>Hoffa's son, James,
tried to contact Giacalone today,</i>

02:50:35.541 --> 02:50:36.958

<i>Hoffa's family and friends stayed</i>

<i>in the family home in Lake Orion today...</i>

02:50:41.166 --> 02:50:42.791
I should call Jo.

02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:46.291
You haven't called Jo yet?

02:50:53.125 --> 02:50:53.958
Why?

02:50:54.916 --> 02:50:55.750
What?

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:57.958
Why?

02:50:59.583 --> 02:51:00.500
Why what?

02:51:02.666 --> 02:51:03.958
Why haven't you called Jo?

02:51:04.958 --> 02:51:05.833
<i>Has anybody come forward</i>

02:51:05.916 --> 02:51:07.791
<i>with a ransom demand
or anything like that?</i>

02:51:07.875 --> 02:51:09.291
<i>Uh, not as of yet.</i>

02:51:09.375 --> 02:51:12.000
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>the abduction was for ransom?</i>

02:51:12.583 --> 02:51:14.000
I'm gonna call her now.

02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:16.541
<i>Do you think the abduction</i>

02:51:16.625 --> 02:51:19.583
<i>had anything to do
with the recent conflicts</i>

02:51:19.666 --> 02:51:21.708
<i>within Local 299, his own Local?</i>

02:51:21.791 --> 02:51:24.000
<i>I think the union politics</i>

02:51:24.083 --> 02:51:26.083
<i>is certainly something
that has to be investigated.</i>

02:51:26.166 --> 02:51:28.541
<i>One high official</i>
<i>of the Teamsters International</i>

02:51:28.625 --> 02:51:30.333
<i>says he fears the worst,</i>

02:51:30.416 --> 02:51:32.333
<i>that Hoffa may have been killed.</i>

02:51:33.166 --> 02:51:36.416
<i>Robert Hager, NBC News,
Bloomfield, Michigan.</i>

02:51:38.041 --> 02:51:39.916
<i>At a truck stop</i>
<i>outside Detroit,</i>

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.833
<i>where Hoffa rose to the top
in the Teamsters Union,</i>

02:51:42.916 --> 02:51:45.250
<i>truck drivers had a variety of theories...</i>

02:51:45.333 --> 02:51:48.041
She stopped talking to me
that day.

02:51:48.125 --> 02:51:50.791
August 3rd, 1975.

02:51:52.333 --> 02:51:56.500
She's got a good job now
and lives just outside Philly.

02:51:58.000 --> 02:51:59.416
But my daughter...

02:52:00.375 --> 02:52:01.291
Peggy...

02:52:02.333 --> 02:52:03.500
disappeared...

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:06.541
from my life that day.

02:52:10.541 --> 02:52:11.375
<i>Hello.</i>

02:52:13.708 --> 02:52:14.916
- Hello.
<i>- Hello?</i>

02:52:15.416 --> 02:52:17.083
Jo. Jo?

02:52:18.416 --> 02:52:19.875
It's... It's...

02:52:19.958 --> 02:52:22.333
<i>- Frank. Frank?</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:52:23.333 --> 02:52:25.250
- Yeah, um...
<i>- I don't...</i>

02:52:26.083 --> 02:52:28.166
- Look, I...
<i>- Frank...</i>

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.375
<i>Do you think...
Do you think he's alive?</i>

02:52:34.166 --> 02:52:35.416
He's gotta be.

02:52:36.791 --> 02:52:38.500
You know, you gotta think positively.

02:52:38.583 --> 02:52:40.791
It's just, you know, it ain't that long.
It's just...

02:52:40.875 --> 02:52:42.125
<i>But do you... </i>

02:52:42.625 --> 02:52:43.916
<i>Do you know he's okay?</i>

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.541
No, no, no, I mean, you know me, I...

02:52:46.625 --> 02:52:49.541
He maybe did something
like the Joe Bananas thing,

02:52:49.625 --> 02:52:52.625
where, you know,
he had himself kidnapped

02:52:52.708 --> 02:52:56.000
and then came back,
but he wasn't hurt, nothing happened.

02:52:56.083 --> 02:52:57.875
Maybe he...

02:52:57.958 --> 02:52:59.208
Maybe he just felt, you know,

02:52:59.291 --> 02:53:01.000
he wanted to clear his head a bit.

02:53:01.083 --> 02:53:03.041
But you gotta just think
that it's gonna be...

02:53:04.083 --> 02:53:05.500
It's gonna be okay.

02:53:06.291 --> 02:53:07.875
It's gonna be okay.

02:53:09.541 --> 02:53:10.958
He's gonna be...

02:53:12.166 --> 02:53:14.916
If you need anything, I'm here for you.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:18.083
Anything. Anything.

02:53:18.166 --> 02:53:20.041
<i>Can you just...
Can you call me again?</i>

02:53:20.125 --> 02:53:22.250
Yeah, I'll call... I'll call you.

02:53:23.875 --> 02:53:25.375
Yeah, I'll... I'll call you.

02:53:26.541 --> 02:53:28.541
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

02:53:28.625 --> 02:53:30.208
<i>Yes, call me tomorrow.</i>

02:53:30.291 --> 02:53:32.708
Okay. I'll call you in the morning, okay?

02:53:32.791 --> 02:53:33.625
<i>Promise?</i>

02:53:33.708 --> 02:53:35.500
Don't worry. Be strong.

02:53:35.583 --> 02:53:36.916
Be positive, huh?

02:53:37.916 --> 02:53:40.125
Okay, Jo, okay, okay.

02:53:40.916 --> 02:53:42.208
Okay.

02:53:42.291 --> 02:53:44.250
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Talk to ya a little later. Bye.

02:53:44.333 --> 02:53:46.250
- Bye.
<i>- Goodbye, Frank.</i>

02:54:45.375 --> 02:54:48.125
It was no more complicated than that.

02:54:49.875 --> 02:54:51.333
Mr. Sheeran,

02:54:52.125 --> 02:54:54.250
do you know who, if anyone,

02:54:54.333 --> 02:54:57.083
was behind the disappearance
of James Hoffa?

02:54:57.166 --> 02:55:00.625
<i>Everybody who ever had</i>
<i>anything to do with Jimmy</i>

02:55:00.708 --> 02:55:02.458
<i>was hauled in and questioned.</i>

02:55:02.541 --> 02:55:03.583
On the advice of counsel,

02:55:03.666 --> 02:55:05.708
I respectfully decline
to answer that question

02:55:05.791 --> 02:55:08.208
on the grounds
that it might tend to incriminate me.

02:55:08.291 --> 02:55:09.625
Okay, let me ask you this:

02:55:10.333 --> 02:55:11.583
what color is my pen?

02:55:14.208 --> 02:55:15.458
<i>And everybody took the Fifth.</i>

02:55:15.541 --> 02:55:17.208
<i>I mean, in that situation,</i>

02:55:17.916 --> 02:55:19.416
<i>that's what you do.
What else are you gonna do?</i>

02:55:20.041 --> 02:55:23.125
<i>Still, everybody got indicted or convicted</i>

02:55:23.208 --> 02:55:24.625
<i>on one thing or another,</i>

02:55:24.708 --> 02:55:25.833
<i>but not that.</i>

02:55:25.916 --> 02:55:27.250
<i>Not about Jimmy.</i>

02:55:27.333 --> 02:55:30.291
<i>Nobody, as you know,
even went to jail for that.</i>

02:55:30.375 --> 02:55:32.333
<i>And nobody talked, which is unusual,</i>

02:55:32.416 --> 02:55:35.000
<i>'cause usually,
three people can keep a secret</i>

02:55:35.083 --> 02:55:36.916
<i>only when two of them are dead.</i>

02:55:38.916 --> 02:55:41.458
<i>Bruno Denzetta and Marco Rossi,</i>

02:55:41.541 --> 02:55:44.916
<i>they got 20 years each
for shaking down a trucking company.</i>

02:55:46.125 --> 02:55:49.208
<i>Pro was convicted with them,
but he was already back in school</i>

02:55:49.291 --> 02:55:51.666
<i>for that other matter
I talked about before.</i>

02:55:51.750 --> 02:55:53.583
<i>Well, you remember
that poor union treasurer,</i>

02:55:53.666 --> 02:55:56.458
<i>Tony "Three Fingers,"
who got more votes than Pro?</i>

02:55:56.541 --> 02:55:58.166
<i>They got him on that.</i>

02:55:58.250 --> 02:56:01.541
<i>Sally Bugs, you know, he did that one.</i>

02:56:07.375 --> 02:56:10.750
<i>One day, Bugs was seen
walking into the Federal building.</i>

02:56:12.333 --> 02:56:13.833
<i>What he did itself</i>
<i>ain't no crime.</i>

02:56:14.541 --> 02:56:17.208
I mean, a lot of people
get called in for things.

02:56:17.291 --> 02:56:19.666
But Sally knows better.

02:56:19.750 --> 02:56:22.000
How come he didn't say anything
to anybody?

02:56:23.208 --> 02:56:25.375
He didn't tell anybody one word.

02:56:25.458 --> 02:56:26.958
Not one word.

02:56:28.291 --> 02:56:30.041
And one thing for sure,

02:56:30.875 --> 02:56:33.041
he didn't go there for fucking lunch.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Sally.

02:56:48.041 --> 02:56:49.833
- What's good?
- Hey, Irish.

02:57:02.083 --> 02:57:05.625
<i>Turns out Sally did tell somebody</i>
<i>he had to go in there for something.</i>

02:57:05.708 --> 02:57:07.291
<i>They just forgot to tell somebody else.</i>

02:57:07.375 --> 02:57:09.666
<i>So it was a bad hit.</i>

02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:14.541
<i>Jimmy's son, Chuckie,
you know, his foster son,</i>

02:57:14.625 --> 02:57:16.125
<i>was in the thing, too,</i>

02:57:16.208 --> 02:57:17.541
<i>but he didn't know it.</i>

02:57:18.583 --> 02:57:20.708
<i>All Chuckie knew
was he was pickin' up</i>

02:57:20.791 --> 02:57:22.375
<i>one of Pro's guys and me,</i>

02:57:22.458 --> 02:57:26.541
<i>and we was all gonna pick up his dad
at the Red Fox for a meeting.</i>

02:57:27.166 --> 02:57:30.875
<i>Well, I mean, he was in it, yeah,
you could say that, but stupidly.</i>

02:57:31.666 --> 02:57:34.541
<i>I... I always felt sorry
for Chuckie in this whole thing.</i>

02:57:34.625 --> 02:57:36.250
<i>And I... I still do.</i>

02:57:36.333 --> 02:57:37.708
<i>And the Feds gave him ten months</i>

02:57:37.791 --> 02:57:40.541
<i>for some bullshit thing about a car,
and that's about it.</i>

02:57:40.625 --> 02:57:42.125
<i>Who knows what the fuck...</i>

02:57:44.041 --> 02:57:47.125
<i>Fat Tony Salerno,
they got on an income tax thing.</i>

02:57:48.041 --> 02:57:48.958
<i>A little while after,</i>

02:57:49.041 --> 02:57:51.750
<i>he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.</i>

02:57:55.625 --> 02:57:58.750
There's a... a pork store up in, uh...

02:58:00.750 --> 02:58:02.625
northern California.

02:58:03.458 --> 02:58:05.208
Uh, right around...

02:58:06.375 --> 02:58:08.625
Walnut Creek.
You're from up there, ain't you?

02:58:09.333 --> 02:58:10.833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:58:10.916 --> 02:58:12.958
And you might even know
the guy that runs it.

02:58:13.791 --> 02:58:16.375
Actually,
I'm looking for a little favor...

02:58:16.458 --> 02:58:18.250
for him, not for me.

02:58:19.208 --> 02:58:22.958
But if you can get him a ticket,
like, to Australia...

02:58:24.458 --> 02:58:25.791
You know what I mean.

02:58:28.291 --> 02:58:29.458
Yeah.

02:58:30.916 --> 02:58:32.916
You want to help him get down there?

02:58:38.458 --> 02:58:39.583
Ye... Yeah.

02:58:39.666 --> 02:58:41.208
<i>Now, Russell, he got pinched</i>

02:58:41.291 --> 02:58:44.250
<i>for telling Jimmy the Weasel
to strangle Jack Napoli</i>

02:58:44.333 --> 02:58:46.875
<i>over some beef
about 25 grand of jewelry</i>

02:58:46.958 --> 02:58:48.458
<i>that Jack took on credit</i>

02:58:48.541 --> 02:58:51.416
<i>from Russell and then he never paid for.</i>

02:58:51.500 --> 02:58:53.916
<i>Now, with Russ, you don't do that.</i>

02:58:55.083 --> 02:58:58.291
<i>So, only thing is, the Weasel, he flipped.</i>

02:58:58.375 --> 02:58:59.958
<i>He had a wire on him.</i>

02:59:00.041 --> 02:59:02.833
<i>They called it
"conspiracy to kill a witness."</i>

02:59:02.916 --> 02:59:05.916
<i>It was obvious to everybody else
that Napoli was clearly in the wrong.</i>

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.125
<i>I mean, how could you not see that?</i>

02:59:08.208 --> 02:59:10.041
<i>He set him up. It was entrapment.</i>

02:59:10.125 --> 02:59:11.583
<i>What else could you call it?</i>

02:59:11.666 --> 02:59:15.625
<i>But that's another thing</i>
<i>I don't wanna get into now. </i>

02:59:15.708 --> 02:59:16.708
Raise your right hand.

02:59:16.791 --> 02:59:20.083
<i>They brought me up on bribery</i>
<i>and labor racketeering charges</i>

02:59:20.166 --> 02:59:21.833
<i>and some other bullshit things
I don't know.</i>

02:59:21.916 --> 02:59:23.208
...the truth, the whole truth

02:59:23.291 --> 02:59:24.375
and nothing but the truth,

02:59:24.458 --> 02:59:25.625
- so help you God?
- I do.

02:59:25.708 --> 02:59:28.000
Did you also tell them that Mr. Boffa

02:59:28.083 --> 02:59:30.083
had given you and your wife
luxury vehicles?

02:59:30.166 --> 02:59:33.291
Mr. Cole, I worked for 44 years,

02:59:33.375 --> 02:59:37.791
I never took one dime illegal
off Boffa or nobody else.

02:59:37.875 --> 02:59:40.291
You can think whatever you wanna think.
Don't matter to me.

02:59:40.375 --> 02:59:43.333
<i>But all they got me for was
blowing up a crane company</i>

02:59:43.416 --> 02:59:45.416
<i>that fired two of my shop stewards</i>

02:59:45.500 --> 02:59:46.833
<i>for no good reason.</i>

02:59:49.291 --> 02:59:51.041
<i>And... And my Lincoln.</i>

02:59:51.666 --> 02:59:54.250
<i>I mean,
I bought that car from Eugene Boffa.</i>

02:59:55.125 --> 02:59:57.458
<i>He leased truck drivers
to freight companies,</i>

02:59:57.541 --> 03:00:00.500
<i>and then he paid them substandard wages.</i>

03:00:02.500 --> 03:00:04.708
<i>They said I paid a lot less for the car</i>

03:00:04.791 --> 03:00:06.250
<i>than what it was worth.</i>

03:00:06.833 --> 03:00:08.791
<i>They said the car was a bribe.</i>

03:00:14.916 --> 03:00:16.916
<i>I... I... I loved that car.</i>

03:00:17.625 --> 03:00:21.291
<i>But it wasn't worth the 18 years
they gave me for it.</i>

03:00:21.375 --> 03:00:22.250
<i>That's for sure.</i>

03:00:27.583 --> 03:00:29.833
<i>Russell, he had a stroke.</i>

03:00:29.916 --> 03:00:33.375
<i>Fat Tony, he couldn't control
his urine no more.</i>

03:00:33.458 --> 03:00:35.375
<i>And my arthritis</i>

03:00:35.458 --> 03:00:38.125
<i>that started in the foxholes of Anzio</i>

03:00:38.208 --> 03:00:40.791
<i>was eatin' away at my lower back now,</i>

03:00:40.875 --> 03:00:43.250
<i>and I couldn't feel much
in my feet no more.</i>

03:00:43.916 --> 03:00:45.250
<i>I needed a cane.</i>

03:00:45.333 --> 03:00:47.916
<i>But, you know, they're not gonna
give you a cane in the can</i>

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.750
<i>because they say
you're gonna use it as a weapon.</i>

03:00:50.833 --> 03:00:52.583
<i>There was this medicine, Neurontin,</i>

03:00:52.666 --> 03:00:55.875
<i>it helped me a little bit,
but it also made you loopy.</i>

03:00:55.958 --> 03:00:57.250
He's got it!

03:00:57.333 --> 03:00:58.750
- He's got it!
- Ah!

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:01.416
<i>We were all falling apart</i>
<i>right there</i>

03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:03.083
<i>in the freezing fucking cold.</i>

03:01:03.166 --> 03:01:04.833
- I can see it from here.
- You getting scared now?

03:01:04.916 --> 03:01:06.833
Yeah, you stay here
another fucking ten years,

03:01:06.916 --> 03:01:07.958
you'll beat me.

03:01:17.166 --> 03:01:18.666
Is this the good grape juice?

03:01:31.416 --> 03:01:32.875
I can't eat it.

03:01:33.375 --> 03:01:35.375
- Take a bite.
- I got no teeth. I can't.

03:01:35.458 --> 03:01:36.583
Put a little piece.

03:01:37.166 --> 03:01:38.333
Just a little piece, thank you.

03:01:38.416 --> 03:01:39.541
That's it?

03:01:53.208 --> 03:01:54.916
<i>- E buono, no?
- Buono.</i>

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.041
<i>Buono.</i>

03:02:01.041 --> 03:02:02.750
Jimmy was a good man.

03:02:03.458 --> 03:02:05.833
You know?
He had a nice family too, huh?

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:07.833
Yeah.

03:02:08.583 --> 03:02:10.583
- Yeah.
- I know.

03:02:12.333 --> 03:02:14.791
I never wanted it to go that far.

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.666
I picked us over him.

03:02:27.541 --> 03:02:28.500
Fuck 'em.

03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:31.000
Fuck 'em.

03:02:32.791 --> 03:02:33.833
Fuck 'em.

03:02:39.708 --> 03:02:43.208
<i>Mangia che cresci... figlio mio, mangia.</i>

03:02:58.541 --> 03:02:59.833
Hey, Russ.

03:02:59.916 --> 03:03:01.041
Hey, Frankie.

03:03:01.125 --> 03:03:02.958
- Where you goin'?
- What?

03:03:03.041 --> 03:03:05.333
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going to church.

03:03:05.916 --> 03:03:06.875
Church?

03:03:07.416 --> 03:03:09.208
Don't laugh, you'll see.

03:03:09.291 --> 03:03:10.375
Don't laugh.

03:03:10.958 --> 03:03:12.041
You'll see.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:21.750
<i>Russell went to church.</i>

03:03:23.875 --> 03:03:27.000
<i>Then he went to the prison hospital.</i>

03:03:29.125 --> 03:03:30.125
<i>And, uh...</i>

03:03:30.208 --> 03:03:32.500
<i>And then he went to the graveyard.</i>

03:03:35.208 --> 03:03:38.458
Lord Jesus Christ, by your own...

03:03:38.541 --> 03:03:40.416
<i> I got out that October.</i>

03:03:40.500 --> 03:03:42.375
<i>Reenie died in December.</i>

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.541
<i>On December 23rd, to be exact.</i>

03:03:46.166 --> 03:03:47.000
<i>Lung cancer.</i>

03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:48.875
<i>No surprise.</i>

03:03:49.916 --> 03:03:52.375
...even as it claims
our mortal bodies.

03:03:53.083 --> 03:03:55.958
Grant that our sister
may sleep here in peace,

03:03:56.041 --> 03:03:58.208
until you awaken her to glory.

03:03:59.083 --> 03:04:01.666
For you are the resurrection
and the life.

03:04:01.750 --> 03:04:04.291
And then she will see you face to face,

03:04:04.375 --> 03:04:06.833
and in your light will see light,

03:04:06.916 --> 03:04:09.416
and know the splendor of God

03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:12.125
for ever and ever. Amen.

03:04:45.250 --> 03:04:50.125
<i>...six points shy</i>
<i>of his career average of .296</i>

03:04:50.208 --> 03:04:51.875
<i>coming into this season.</i>

03:04:51.958 --> 03:04:56.791
<i>Top four batters in this lineup for
Philadelphia today are all switch hitters.</i>

03:05:50.916 --> 03:05:53.541
<i>Much to the frustration</i>
<i>of some policy makers,</i>

03:05:53.625 --> 03:05:56.416
<i>NATO military leaders will not risk</i>

03:05:56.500 --> 03:05:59.708
<i>low flying attacks
on Serb troops in Kosovo.</i>

03:06:01.333 --> 03:06:05.208
<i>It could take days more
of systematic bombing, especially since</i>

03:06:05.291 --> 03:06:08.916
<i>the Serbs have hidden so many
of their anti-aircraft missiles,</i>

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.333
<i>in essence, daring NATO to fly low.</i>

03:06:34.791 --> 03:06:37.000
You go... you go there. Yeah, yeah.

03:06:37.583 --> 03:06:38.458
Yeah, yeah.

03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:49.166
Peggy.

03:06:49.250 --> 03:06:51.708
Peggy. I just want to talk.

03:07:13.500 --> 03:07:15.458
<i>I just, you know... I...</i>

03:07:15.541 --> 03:07:16.666
<i>She walked away.</i>

03:07:18.041 --> 03:07:20.625
I know she's mad at me and all,
but I... I want...

03:07:20.708 --> 03:07:23.458
Call her. Call her.
I just want to talk to her.

03:07:24.916 --> 03:07:26.708
Talk to her and tell her what?

03:07:26.791 --> 03:07:28.416
What...

03:07:28.500 --> 03:07:30.625
I just want to say I'm sorry. That's all.

03:07:32.208 --> 03:07:33.083
For?

03:07:35.666 --> 03:07:36.583
Look...

03:07:37.916 --> 03:07:40.875
I know I wasn't a... a good dad.
I know that.

03:07:40.958 --> 03:07:43.458
I know that.
I was just trying to protect her.

03:07:43.541 --> 03:07:44.791
Protect all of youse.

03:07:44.875 --> 03:07:47.291
I mean, that's what I was doing.
That's...

03:07:48.458 --> 03:07:49.458
From what?

03:07:50.500 --> 03:07:51.583
Well, everything.

03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:53.625
I mean...

03:07:53.708 --> 03:07:57.166
You... Youse had
a sheltered life, in a way,

03:07:57.250 --> 03:07:58.750
because you didn't see what I see

03:07:58.833 --> 03:08:00.458
and what I've been through.

03:08:03.166 --> 03:08:04.958
There's a lot of bad people out there.

03:08:05.041 --> 03:08:07.000
What else am I gonna do?

03:08:07.083 --> 03:08:10.000
Daddy, you have no idea
what it was like for us.

03:08:11.791 --> 03:08:13.416
I mean, we couldn't go to you
with a problem

03:08:13.500 --> 03:08:14.958
'cause of what you would do.

03:08:15.041 --> 03:08:17.416
You know,
we couldn't come to you for protection

03:08:17.500 --> 03:08:19.875
because of the terrible things
that you would do.

03:08:22.666 --> 03:08:24.458
I was just... I was...
I didn't want to see

03:08:24.541 --> 03:08:26.666
youse get hurt, that's all.

03:08:27.375 --> 03:08:28.250
Um...

03:08:31.291 --> 03:08:34.250
I know you read a lot of things about me,
heard about me.

03:08:34.333 --> 03:08:35.416
I'm sorry.

03:08:35.916 --> 03:08:36.958
I... um...

03:08:38.958 --> 03:08:41.791
Can I do anything now
to make it up to you?

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:45.833
Huh?

03:08:53.916 --> 03:08:56.250
If you're looking for something
with a little bit more luxury,

03:08:56.333 --> 03:08:58.541
we have these two models
over here.

03:08:58.625 --> 03:09:00.750
They're like the Cadillacs of caskets.

03:09:01.291 --> 03:09:02.875
Now, if we puttin' you
in the fuckin' oven,

03:09:02.958 --> 03:09:04.666
it really doesn't matter what you go in.

03:09:05.250 --> 03:09:06.583
The cheapest shit possible.

03:09:06.666 --> 03:09:08.500
Particle board, that's it.

03:09:08.583 --> 03:09:10.958
What are we doin' today?
Are we doin' a cremation?

03:09:11.791 --> 03:09:13.666
- A burial.
- Burial?

03:09:14.250 --> 03:09:15.791
Uh, is it for a man or for a woman?

03:09:15.875 --> 03:09:16.833
Me.

03:09:17.916 --> 03:09:18.750
Shit.

03:09:23.708 --> 03:09:24.833
You see anything you like?

03:09:27.458 --> 03:09:28.500
Uh...

03:09:36.333 --> 03:09:38.333
- That green one.
- That's a beauty.

03:09:38.416 --> 03:09:40.833
That one'll set you back about $7,500

03:09:40.916 --> 03:09:42.166
if you take it home today.

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:43.916
What do you think?

03:09:45.583 --> 03:09:46.958
Can you do any better?

03:09:47.708 --> 03:09:51.791
I mean, buddy,
this is what you want to go home in, no?

03:09:53.125 --> 03:09:56.375
I think we could go six
on that for you. How about that?

03:09:57.125 --> 03:09:59.500
- Six flat cash work for you?
- That's good.

03:10:00.666 --> 03:10:01.666
Good for me.

03:10:21.708 --> 03:10:23.416
<i>Sooner or later,</i>

03:10:23.500 --> 03:10:26.500
<i>everybody put here has a date
when he's gonna go.</i>

03:10:26.583 --> 03:10:28.083
<i>That's just the way it is.</i>

03:10:29.333 --> 03:10:33.166
<i>And I think there's gotta be
something when you go</i>

03:10:33.833 --> 03:10:38.291
<i>'cause, I mean, how the hell
did this whole thing start?</i>

03:10:42.250 --> 03:10:44.750
<i>People smarter than me
can't figure it out.</i>

03:10:44.833 --> 03:10:47.541
<i>That's why I would never go for cremation
because it's so...</i>

03:10:47.625 --> 03:10:48.958
<i>it's so final.</i>

03:10:50.833 --> 03:10:52.083
This... This one.

03:10:53.583 --> 03:10:54.916
1948.

03:10:56.250 --> 03:10:59.250
<i>That's the hardest part</i>
<i>of anybody when they bury youse,</i>

03:10:59.333 --> 03:11:02.208
<i>is when they go into the ground
because it's...</i>

03:11:02.291 --> 03:11:03.416
<i>it's so final.</i>

03:11:04.750 --> 03:11:07.333
<i>If you go into a building,
the building's there.</i>

03:11:07.416 --> 03:11:08.833
<i>The crypt is there.</i>

03:11:08.916 --> 03:11:10.583
<i>It has to be a metal casket,</i>

03:11:10.666 --> 03:11:12.166
and they have you in the room.

03:11:12.666 --> 03:11:14.000
And all that there.

03:11:14.083 --> 03:11:15.875
It's just not as final. You're dead,

03:11:15.958 --> 03:11:18.125
but it ain't that final.

03:11:21.458 --> 03:11:24.583
I'm sorry, but I gotta direct youse

03:11:24.666 --> 03:11:27.041
to my attorney, Mr. Ragano...

03:11:28.916 --> 03:11:31.333
if youse want to talk about
Mr. Hoffa or...

03:11:32.041 --> 03:11:34.041
or any matter, for that matter.

03:11:34.125 --> 03:11:35.833
I got noth... nothing new to say.

03:11:37.041 --> 03:11:38.000
He's dead.

03:11:38.916 --> 03:11:39.875
Who's dead?

03:11:40.708 --> 03:11:42.166
Your attorney, Mr. Ragano.

03:11:42.250 --> 03:11:43.083
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

03:11:43.166 --> 03:11:44.250
Who did it?

03:11:46.125 --> 03:11:46.958
Cancer.

03:11:49.875 --> 03:11:51.708
Everybody's dead, Mr. Sheeran.

03:11:53.583 --> 03:11:54.583
It's over.

03:11:55.250 --> 03:11:56.250
They're all gone.

03:11:56.333 --> 03:11:58.833
Russell, Angelo, Salerno,

03:11:58.916 --> 03:12:02.083
Pro, Dorfman, Sally Bugs.
They're gone.

03:12:04.125 --> 03:12:05.333
Who are you protecting?

03:12:07.500 --> 03:12:08.875
You know who's not gone?

03:12:10.416 --> 03:12:12.708
Mr. Hoffa's family. His children.

03:12:13.416 --> 03:12:16.375
They're here.
And they gotta live not knowing.

03:12:17.916 --> 03:12:18.958
That's hard to do.

03:12:21.958 --> 03:12:23.333
I mean, you got kids, Frank.

03:12:24.208 --> 03:12:25.250
Can you imagine?

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:34.083
Frank, it's time.
It's time you say what happened.

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
You seem like nice fellas.

03:12:43.833 --> 03:12:45.833
I appreciate youse coming to see me.

03:12:46.666 --> 03:12:48.375
But I... I can't help you.

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:52.875
That's it?

03:12:52.958 --> 03:12:54.083
That's it.

03:13:01.125 --> 03:13:03.666
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God...</i>

03:13:03.750 --> 03:13:04.916
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God...</i>

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.500
- Pray for us sinners...
- Pray for us sinners...

03:13:07.583 --> 03:13:10.708
Now and at the hour of our death.

03:13:11.333 --> 03:13:12.958
- Amen.
- Amen.

03:13:15.791 --> 03:13:16.875
That was...

03:13:17.500 --> 03:13:19.083
That wasn't too bad.

03:13:19.166 --> 03:13:20.291
It's been a while.

03:13:20.375 --> 03:13:22.000
Not bad at all.

03:13:22.083 --> 03:13:24.708
And the intention was there.
The intention.

03:13:24.791 --> 03:13:25.875
I know.

03:13:26.541 --> 03:13:28.250
I know the intention is there.

03:13:28.333 --> 03:13:29.666
It was there, Father.

03:13:31.458 --> 03:13:33.458
Do you feel anything for...

03:13:33.541 --> 03:13:35.708
for what you've done?

03:13:39.250 --> 03:13:42.583
I, I don't. I mean, maybe that...

03:13:43.708 --> 03:13:45.833
Because I'm here now talking to you,

03:13:45.916 --> 03:13:47.708
that in itself is,

03:13:47.791 --> 03:13:51.000
you know, an attempt to...

03:13:54.500 --> 03:13:57.750
But you don't feel anything at all?

03:13:59.500 --> 03:14:00.583
No.

03:14:03.041 --> 03:14:05.750
- Water under the dam.
- Mmm.

03:14:09.291 --> 03:14:11.208
Any... Any remorse

03:14:11.958 --> 03:14:13.416
for the families?

03:14:13.500 --> 03:14:15.958
I... I didn't know the families.

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.208
I didn't know 'em. Except one I knew.

03:14:26.791 --> 03:14:29.750
I think we can... we can be sorry...

03:14:29.833 --> 03:14:33.333
We can be sorry
even when we don't feel sorry.

03:14:33.416 --> 03:14:36.458
Well, for us to say,
to make a decision of the will...

03:14:36.541 --> 03:14:37.500
"God..."

03:14:38.166 --> 03:14:39.833
I am sorry, God.

03:14:41.666 --> 03:14:42.666
"Forgive me."

03:14:43.708 --> 03:14:46.583
And that... that's a decision of the will.

03:14:53.250 --> 03:14:55.791
What kind of man

03:14:57.375 --> 03:15:00.125
makes a... a phone call like that?

03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:08.000
What do you mean? What phone call?

03:15:08.083 --> 03:15:10.458
Well, I can't tell you. Uh...

03:15:10.541 --> 03:15:11.625
Mmm.

03:15:12.625 --> 03:15:13.958
I can't. I got...

03:15:15.125 --> 03:15:16.291
That's okay.

03:15:19.833 --> 03:15:21.666
Frank, do you wanna pray with me again?

03:15:21.750 --> 03:15:22.583
Yeah.

03:15:23.583 --> 03:15:25.416
This time,
we'll do it in our own words. Okay?

03:15:25.500 --> 03:15:26.583
Okay.

03:15:28.791 --> 03:15:30.541
God, we come before you

03:15:31.375 --> 03:15:33.625
sinful and sorrowful.

03:15:33.708 --> 03:15:35.916
Sinful and sorrowful.

03:15:37.291 --> 03:15:41.250
<i>We know you are</i>
<i>all good and all merciful.</i>

03:15:41.333 --> 03:15:44.625
<i> We know you are</i>
<i>all good and all merciful.</i>

03:15:45.958 --> 03:15:49.041
- <i>We ask you...</i>
<i>-  We ask you...</i>

03:15:49.125 --> 03:15:54.208
<i>- to help us see ourselves...
- to help us see ourselves...</i>

03:15:54.291 --> 03:15:57.125
<i>- as you see us.
- as you see us.</i>

03:16:00.083 --> 03:16:01.791
That's my daughter, Peggy.

03:16:01.875 --> 03:16:03.375
- Is it?
- Yeah.

03:16:03.458 --> 03:16:04.916
I don't think I've met her yet.

03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:08.000
Well, she...
she ain't been around too much.

03:16:08.083 --> 03:16:09.500
Is she your only child?

03:16:09.583 --> 03:16:11.916
No, I got four daughters.

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:13.916
Over there. See?

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:15.041
Beautiful.

03:16:15.583 --> 03:16:17.458
- Busy man.
- Yeah.

03:16:19.250 --> 03:16:20.250
Yeah.

03:16:21.250 --> 03:16:22.333
Who's that with her?

03:16:24.083 --> 03:16:25.500
You don't know who that is?

03:16:27.458 --> 03:16:28.333
No.

03:16:29.583 --> 03:16:30.708
Jimmy Hoffa.

03:16:32.833 --> 03:16:33.791
Oh, yeah.

03:16:33.875 --> 03:16:34.875
Yeah, right, "Oh, yeah."

03:16:37.083 --> 03:16:38.208
You don't know who he is.

03:16:38.291 --> 03:16:40.041
Okay, I don't.

03:16:40.833 --> 03:16:43.250
Yeah. Oh, boy, you don't know how fast

03:16:43.333 --> 03:16:45.708
time goes by until you get there.

03:16:46.500 --> 03:16:48.291
But you don't have to worry about that

03:16:48.375 --> 03:16:50.875
because you have
your whole life ahead of you.

03:16:50.958 --> 03:16:53.291
- Forever. It goes fast, time...
- Hey.

03:16:53.375 --> 03:16:54.875
I'm tellin' ya.

03:16:54.958 --> 03:16:56.791
I'm trying to take your pulse,
Mr. Sheeran.

03:16:56.875 --> 03:16:58.333
Please, please don't talk.

03:17:00.416 --> 03:17:01.333
It's great today.

03:17:01.916 --> 03:17:03.416
I'm still alive?

03:17:03.500 --> 03:17:05.750
- Yes, you are.
- That's good to know.

03:17:06.291 --> 03:17:07.625
Alive and well.

03:17:07.708 --> 03:17:08.833
And you're free

03:17:08.916 --> 03:17:11.625
till later today when we have
to put you through all this again.

03:17:11.708 --> 03:17:12.666
I'm here.

03:17:31.666 --> 03:17:33.125
...ministry of the church.

03:17:33.208 --> 03:17:36.000
May God grant you pardon and peace, Frank.

03:17:36.083 --> 03:17:37.708
And I absolve you from your sins.

03:17:37.791 --> 03:17:40.208
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son,

03:17:40.291 --> 03:17:42.541
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

03:17:43.500 --> 03:17:46.083
Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.

03:17:46.166 --> 03:17:47.208
His mercy...

03:17:47.291 --> 03:17:49.458
- His mercy endures forever.
- endures forever.

03:17:49.541 --> 03:17:52.833
All right, Frank.
I'll be back to visit, okay? Very soon.

03:17:52.916 --> 03:17:55.333
Probably after the Christmas holidays.

03:17:55.416 --> 03:17:56.958
Oh, okay.

03:17:57.041 --> 03:17:59.833
- Frank, God bless you.
- You too. Thank you.

03:18:02.250 --> 03:18:03.250
It's Christmas?

03:18:04.541 --> 03:18:05.541
Almost.

03:18:06.583 --> 03:18:08.166
Well, I ain't going nowhere.

03:18:10.750 --> 03:18:12.791
- Hey, Father?
- Yup?

03:18:12.875 --> 03:18:15.250
- Do me a favor?
- Mmm-hmm.

03:18:15.333 --> 03:18:18.250
Don't shut the door all the way.
I don't like that. Just...

03:18:18.333 --> 03:18:20.541
- leave it open a little bit.
- Oh, okay.
