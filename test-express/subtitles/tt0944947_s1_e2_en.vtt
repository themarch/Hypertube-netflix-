00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:13.034
You need to drink, child.

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:18.885
And eat.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.857
Isn't there
anything else?

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:28.528
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance:

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:32.332
Grass and horses.
People can't live on grass.

00:02:41.342 --> 00:02:44.010
<i>In the Shadow Lands</i>
<i>beyond Asshai,</i>

00:02:44.044 --> 00:02:46.412
<i>they say there are</i>
<i>fields of ghost grass</i>

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.582
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:52.251
It murders
all other grass.

00:02:52.286 --> 00:02:54.754
The Dothraki believe
that one day

00:02:54.822 --> 00:02:58.024
it will cover everything--
that's the way the world will end.

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:13.072
It'll get easier.

00:03:51.178 --> 00:03:51.210
Khaleesi!

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:54.647
Your hands.

00:04:05.192 --> 00:04:07.827
We're still not far
from Pentos, your Grace.

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:10.329
Magister Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:12.398
You'd be more
comfortable there.

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.834
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

00:04:14.868 --> 00:04:17.336
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills

00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:19.672
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.075
As you wish, your Grace.

00:04:23.243 --> 00:04:25.311
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:27.747
I suppose it is preferable
to beheading.

00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:31.517
What did Ned Stark
want you for?

00:04:31.552 --> 00:04:33.519
Buying from a slaver?

00:04:33.587 --> 00:04:36.355
Selling to one--

00:04:36.423 --> 00:04:38.858
some poachers I caught
on my land.

00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:43.596
Under my reign, you won't be
punished for such nonsense.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.965
You can rest assured
of that.

00:05:10.724 --> 00:05:13.559
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

00:05:17.498 --> 00:05:20.099
My mother's been
looking for you.

00:05:20.134 --> 00:05:22.502
We ride for
King's Landing today.

00:05:22.536 --> 00:05:25.638
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

00:05:25.672 --> 00:05:27.740
and offer
your sympathies.

00:05:27.774 --> 00:05:30.710
What good will
my sympathies do them?

00:05:32.412 --> 00:05:35.248
None. But it is
expected of you.

00:05:35.282 --> 00:05:37.383
Your absence has
already been noted.

00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:39.552
The boy means
nothing to me.

00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:42.021
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

00:05:44.191 --> 00:05:46.092
One word and I'll
hit you again.

00:05:46.126 --> 00:05:47.894
I'm telling mother!

00:05:48.762 --> 00:05:51.364
Go!
Tell her.

00:05:51.398 --> 00:05:53.499
But first you will get
to Lord and Lady Stark

00:05:53.534 --> 00:05:55.535
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.404
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

00:05:58.438 --> 00:06:01.908
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

00:06:01.942 --> 00:06:04.110
You can't--

00:06:04.144 --> 00:06:05.711
Do you understand?

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:14.687
The prince will
remember that, little lord.

00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:16.722
I hope so.

00:06:16.757 --> 00:06:20.259
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

00:06:22.996 --> 00:06:26.132
Ah.
Time for breakfast.

00:06:33.173 --> 00:06:36.309
Bread.
And two of those little fish.

00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:39.779
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.417
And bacon,
burned black.

00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:46.419
Hyah.

00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:49.455
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:55.828
Is Bran going to die?

00:06:57.631 --> 00:06:59.732
Apparently not.

00:07:01.902 --> 00:07:05.504
- What do you mean?
- The Maester says the boy may live.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.649
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

00:07:16.683 --> 00:07:18.451
Only the gods
know for certain.

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:21.020
All the rest of us
can do is pray.

00:07:22.456 --> 00:07:25.024
The charms of the north
seem entirely lost on you.

00:07:25.058 --> 00:07:26.993
I still can't believe
you're going.

00:07:27.027 --> 00:07:29.028
It's ridiculous
even for you.

00:07:29.062 --> 00:07:30.796
Where's your sense
of wonder?

00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:35.034
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of The Night's Watch,

00:07:35.102 --> 00:07:37.637
the wintry abode
of the White Walkers.

00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:40.606
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:43.542
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

00:07:43.577 --> 00:07:45.678
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:47.680
No, I just want to stand
on top of the wall

00:07:47.714 --> 00:07:49.815
and piss off
the edge of the world.

00:07:51.218 --> 00:07:53.886
The children don't need
to hear your filth.

00:07:55.722 --> 00:07:57.556
Come.

00:08:03.664 --> 00:08:07.077
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

00:08:07.078 --> 00:08:10.264
Give me a good
clean death any day.

00:08:11.471 --> 00:08:14.740
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

00:08:14.808 --> 00:08:18.010
Death is so final,
whereas life...

00:08:18.045 --> 00:08:20.046
Ah, life is full
of possibilities.

00:08:21.448 --> 00:08:22.948
I hope the boy does wake.

00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:25.584
I'd be very interested
to hear what he has to say.

00:08:28.088 --> 00:08:29.955
My dear brother,

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.658
there are times you make me
wonder whose side you're on.

00:08:32.693 --> 00:08:35.027
<i>My</i> dear brother,
you wound me.

00:08:35.062 --> 00:08:37.630
You know how much
I love my family.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.084
Please.

00:08:58.118 --> 00:09:01.520
Oh, I would have
dressed, your Grace.

00:09:01.555 --> 00:09:04.023
This is your home.
I'm your guest.

00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:09.228
Handsome one, isn't he?

00:09:09.262 --> 00:09:14.066
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:17.203
He was a fighter too--

00:09:17.237 --> 00:09:20.573
tried to beat the fever
that took him.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.875
Forgive me.

00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:24.910
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

00:09:24.945 --> 00:09:27.179
I never knew.

00:09:27.214 --> 00:09:29.048
It was years ago.

00:09:30.617 --> 00:09:33.586
Robert was crazed, beat
his hands bloody on the wall,

00:09:33.653 --> 00:09:37.490
all the things men do to show
you how much they care.

00:09:42.362 --> 00:09:44.563
The boy looked
just like him.

00:09:46.233 --> 00:09:48.934
Such a little thing...

00:09:49.002 --> 00:09:51.837
A bird without feathers.

00:09:54.007 --> 00:09:58.844
They came to take his body away
and Robert held me.

00:09:58.845 --> 00:10:00.978
I screamed and I battled,
but he held me.

00:10:06.219 --> 00:10:08.220
That little bundle.

00:10:10.023 --> 00:10:12.491
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:14.860
Never have visited
the crypt, never.

00:10:25.472 --> 00:10:27.506
I pray to the mother
every morning and night

00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:29.775
that she return
your child to you.

00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:33.446
I am grateful.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.549
Perhaps this time
she'll listen.

00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:29.635
A sword for the wall?

00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:34.373
- I already have one.
- Good man.

00:11:34.407 --> 00:11:37.610
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:39.278
At someone, I mean.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.952
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

00:11:46.987 --> 00:11:50.155
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.626
and blood and some bone
to keep it all standing.

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:57.997
Let me thank you
ahead of time

00:11:58.031 --> 00:12:00.866
for guarding us all from
the perils beyond the wall--

00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:03.502
Wildlings and White Walkers
and whatnot.

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:07.273
We're grateful to have

00:12:07.307 --> 00:12:09.675
good, strong men like you
protecting us.

00:12:12.212 --> 00:12:14.980
We've guarded the kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:20.185
Is it "we" already?

00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:23.389
Have you taken
your vows then?

00:12:23.423 --> 00:12:24.690
Soon enough.

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:29.261
Give my regards
to The Night's Watch.

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:32.731
I'm sure it will be thrilling
to serve in such an elite force.

00:12:32.766 --> 00:12:34.700
And if not?

00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:37.603
It's only for life.

00:12:56.289 --> 00:12:58.357
Thank you, Nymeria.

00:13:05.065 --> 00:13:08.033
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

00:13:08.068 --> 00:13:10.703
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

00:13:10.737 --> 00:13:12.476
Who cares how they're folded?!

00:13:12.477 --> 00:13:13.902
They're going to get all
messed up anyway.

00:13:15.109 --> 00:13:16.275
It's good
you've got help.

00:13:16.276 --> 00:13:18.110
Watch.

00:13:18.144 --> 00:13:20.045
Nymeria, gloves.

00:13:26.152 --> 00:13:28.153
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

00:13:28.188 --> 00:13:30.789
Nymeria, gloves!

00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:34.660
I have something for you.

00:13:34.694 --> 00:13:37.029
And it has to be packed
very carefully.

00:13:37.063 --> 00:13:38.864
A present?

00:13:38.898 --> 00:13:41.000
Close the door.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.848
This is no toy.

00:13:58.485 --> 00:14:01.353
Be careful you don't
cut yourself.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.258
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

00:14:07.494 --> 00:14:09.361
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

00:14:09.396 --> 00:14:10.863
<i>It won't hack</i>
<i>a man's head off,</i>

00:14:10.897 --> 00:14:13.032
but it can poke him full
of holes if you're quick enough.

00:14:13.066 --> 00:14:14.103
I can be quick.

00:14:14.128 --> 00:14:15.824
You'll have to work
at it every day.

00:14:17.003 --> 00:14:18.437
How does it feel?

00:14:18.471 --> 00:14:21.140
Do you like
the balance?

00:14:21.174 --> 00:14:23.342
I think so.

00:14:24.711 --> 00:14:27.179
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

00:14:27.213 --> 00:14:29.248
I know which end to use.

00:14:34.721 --> 00:14:36.789
I'm going to miss you.

00:14:38.358 --> 00:14:39.792
Careful.

00:14:51.004 --> 00:14:53.939
All the best swords
have names, you know.

00:14:56.676 --> 00:14:59.311
Sansa can keep
her sewing needles.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.915
I've got a needle
of my own.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.732
I came to say
goodbye to Bran.

00:15:19.766 --> 00:15:21.500
You've said it.

00:15:32.212 --> 00:15:35.247
I wish I could be here
when you wake up.

00:15:38.218 --> 00:15:40.753
I'm going north
with Uncle Benjen.

00:15:40.787 --> 00:15:42.554
I'm taking the black.

00:15:51.464 --> 00:15:54.199
I know we always talked about
seeing the wall together,

00:15:54.234 --> 00:15:58.103
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

00:15:59.939 --> 00:16:02.274
I'll know my way
around by then.

00:16:02.308 --> 00:16:05.077
I'll be a sworn brother
of The Night's Watch.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.185
We can go out walking beyond the wall,
if you're not afraid.

00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:30.035
I want you

00:16:30.103 --> 00:16:31.703
to leave.

00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:34.199
17 years ago

00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:36.401
you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:41.940
You came back a year later with
another woman's son.

00:17:43.409 --> 00:17:46.111
And now
you're leaving again.

00:17:48.781 --> 00:17:50.549
I have no choice.

00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:54.453
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

00:17:54.487 --> 00:17:58.056
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:01.960
You do have a choice.

00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:04.763
And you've made it.

00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:09.935
Cat--

00:18:15.608 --> 00:18:18.310
I can't do it, Ned.

00:18:21.281 --> 00:18:24.483
- I really can't.
- You can.

00:18:26.786 --> 00:18:28.587
You must.

00:18:52.011 --> 00:18:54.546
You've said
goodbye to Bran?

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.015
He's not going to die.
I know it.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.351
You Starks
are hard to kill.

00:19:00.253 --> 00:19:01.954
My mother?

00:19:01.988 --> 00:19:04.456
- She was very kind.
- Good.

00:19:06.192 --> 00:19:08.460
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

00:19:08.494 --> 00:19:10.662
It was always my color.

00:19:11.864 --> 00:19:15.000
- Farewell, Snow.
- And you, Stark.

00:20:07.453 --> 00:20:09.988
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.

00:20:12.025 --> 00:20:15.460
<i>The Starks have manned the wall</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

00:20:15.495 --> 00:20:18.463
And you are a Stark.

00:20:18.498 --> 00:20:20.732
You might not have my name,

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.901
but you have my blood.

00:20:29.242 --> 00:20:31.643
Is my mother alive?

00:20:31.677 --> 00:20:34.880
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

00:20:36.482 --> 00:20:38.583
Does she care?

00:20:39.752 --> 00:20:42.054
The next time
we see each other,

00:20:42.088 --> 00:20:44.423
we'll talk
about your mother.

00:20:44.457 --> 00:20:46.324
Huh?

00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:48.427
I promise.

00:21:28.034 --> 00:21:31.036
Gods, this is country!

00:21:32.805 --> 00:21:36.374
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

00:21:38.511 --> 00:21:40.812
I've half a mind
to go with you.

00:21:40.847 --> 00:21:42.881
What do you say,
just you and me

00:21:42.915 --> 00:21:45.450
on the Kingsroad,
swords at our sides,

00:21:45.485 --> 00:21:49.054
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

00:21:49.088 --> 00:21:51.756
You should have
asked me 20 years ago.

00:21:51.791 --> 00:21:54.659
There were wars to fight,
women to marry--

00:21:54.694 --> 00:21:56.761
we never had the chance
to be young.

00:21:56.796 --> 00:21:58.797
I recall
a few chances.

00:22:02.668 --> 00:22:05.337
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

00:22:05.371 --> 00:22:07.339
That common girl of yours?

00:22:07.373 --> 00:22:10.175
Becca? With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

00:22:10.243 --> 00:22:12.544
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

00:22:12.578 --> 00:22:16.214
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie

00:22:16.249 --> 00:22:19.084
and her tits.

00:22:19.118 --> 00:22:21.520
Yours was... Aleena?

00:22:21.554 --> 00:22:24.623
No. You told me once.
Meryl?

00:22:24.657 --> 00:22:26.691
Your bastard's mother?

00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:30.595
- Wylla.
- <i>That's it.</i>

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.797
<i>She must have been</i>
<i>a rare wench</i>

00:22:32.832 --> 00:22:35.667
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

00:22:35.701 --> 00:22:37.936
You never told me
what she looked like.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.338
Nor will I.

00:22:42.808 --> 00:22:44.676
We were at war.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.379
<i>None of us knew if we were</i>
<i>gonna go back home again.</i>

00:22:47.413 --> 00:22:50.882
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

00:22:52.785 --> 00:22:55.987
I swear if I weren't your King,
you'd have hit me already.

00:22:56.022 --> 00:22:59.057
The worst thing
about your coronation--

00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:01.660
I'll never get
to hit you again.

00:23:03.829 --> 00:23:06.398
Trust me, that's not
the worst thing.

00:23:10.369 --> 00:23:12.404
There was a rider
in the night.

00:23:18.477 --> 00:23:21.980
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

00:23:22.014 --> 00:23:24.683
What of it?
Should we send her a wedding gift?

00:23:24.717 --> 00:23:26.418
A knife perhaps,
a good sharp one,

00:23:26.452 --> 00:23:28.386
and a bold man to wield it.

00:23:28.454 --> 00:23:30.388
She's little more
than a child.

00:23:30.423 --> 00:23:33.658
Soon enough that child will spread
her legs and start breeding.

00:23:33.693 --> 00:23:37.362
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

00:23:37.396 --> 00:23:41.266
<i>What her father did to your family--</i>
<i>that was unspeakable.</i>

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.368
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister--

00:23:43.402 --> 00:23:45.537
<i>the woman I loved.</i>

00:23:45.571 --> 00:23:48.840
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

00:23:48.874 --> 00:23:51.076
But you can't get
your hands on this one, can you?

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.044
This Khal Drogo,

00:23:53.079 --> 00:23:55.413
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

00:23:55.448 --> 00:23:58.216
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

00:23:58.251 --> 00:24:01.052
as long as they remain on the
other side of the Narrow Sea.

00:24:01.087 --> 00:24:03.054
They have no ships,
Robert.

00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:06.258
There are still those in the
Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.

00:24:07.793 --> 00:24:11.062
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

00:24:11.097 --> 00:24:13.898
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

00:24:15.601 --> 00:24:18.770
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

00:24:23.542 --> 00:24:25.644
There's a war coming, Ned.

00:24:25.678 --> 00:24:27.512
<i>I don't know when,</i>

00:24:27.546 --> 00:24:30.081
I don't know who
we'll be fighting,

00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:31.616
but it's coming.

00:25:43.356 --> 00:25:45.256
Sit.

00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:47.292
You'll be fed.

00:25:50.596 --> 00:25:52.964
<i>Untie them.</i>

00:25:52.998 --> 00:25:56.468
Ah, rapers.

00:25:58.504 --> 00:26:02.307
They were given a choice no doubt--
castration or the wall.

00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:04.776
Most choose the knife.

00:26:09.415 --> 00:26:12.317
Not impressed
by your new brothers?

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.955
<i>Lovely thing</i>
<i>about the watch--</i>

00:26:16.989 --> 00:26:20.492
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

00:26:29.168 --> 00:26:31.336
Why do you read so much?

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.639
Look at me and tell me
what you see.

00:26:35.808 --> 00:26:37.675
Is this a trick?

00:26:37.743 --> 00:26:41.446
What you see is a dwarf.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.916
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.753
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

00:26:48.788 --> 00:26:51.322
Things are expected of me.

00:26:51.357 --> 00:26:53.792
My father was the Hand
of the King for 20 years.

00:26:53.826 --> 00:26:56.027
Until your brother
killed that King.

00:27:01.534 --> 00:27:05.503
Yes, until my brother
killed him.

00:27:07.406 --> 00:27:10.041
<i>Life is full of these</i>
<i>little ironies.</i>

00:27:11.243 --> 00:27:13.211
My sister married
the new King

00:27:13.245 --> 00:27:16.448
and my repulsive nephew
will be King after him.

00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:22.353
I must do my part for the honor
of my house, wouldn't you agree?

00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:25.990
<i>But how?</i>

00:27:26.025 --> 00:27:28.827
Well, my brother
has his sword

00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:30.728
and I have my mind.

00:27:30.796 --> 00:27:34.098
And a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

00:27:34.133 --> 00:27:37.235
That's why I read
so much, Jon Snow.

00:27:40.573 --> 00:27:43.041
And you?

00:27:43.075 --> 00:27:45.410
What's your story,
bastard?

00:27:47.613 --> 00:27:50.615
Ask me nicely and maybe
I'll tell you, dwarf.

00:27:54.386 --> 00:27:57.355
A bastard boy
with nothing to inherit,

00:27:57.389 --> 00:27:59.324
<i>off to join</i>

00:27:59.358 --> 00:28:01.826
<i>the ancient order</i>
<i>of The Night's Watch,</i>

00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:05.830
alongside his Valiant
brothers-in-arms.

00:28:05.865 --> 00:28:07.932
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from--

00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:11.202
ah, yes yes, against grumpkins
and snarks

00:28:11.237 --> 00:28:14.672
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

00:28:14.707 --> 00:28:17.075
<i>You're a smart boy.</i>

00:28:17.109 --> 00:28:19.711
You don't believe
that nonsense.

00:28:27.052 --> 00:28:30.188
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.459
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

00:29:08.527 --> 00:29:12.630
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

00:29:14.199 --> 00:29:16.801
Talk to Poole about it.

00:29:18.137 --> 00:29:21.239
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

00:29:21.273 --> 00:29:23.975
<i>We need a new steward,</i>

00:29:24.009 --> 00:29:27.178
and there are several other
appointments that require

00:29:27.212 --> 00:29:31.316
- our immediate attention--
- I don't care about appointments!

00:29:32.618 --> 00:29:34.485
I'll make the appointments.

00:29:37.222 --> 00:29:39.137
We'll talk about it
first thing in the morning.

00:29:39.162 --> 00:29:41.362
Very good, my Lord.

00:29:43.596 --> 00:29:45.229
My Lady.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.311
When was the last time
you left this room?

00:30:00.346 --> 00:30:02.981
I have to take care
of him.

00:30:03.015 --> 00:30:04.882
He's not going
to die, mother.

00:30:04.883 --> 00:30:07.094
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

00:30:07.095 --> 00:30:08.461
<i>What if he's wrong?</i>

00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:12.261
- Bran needs me.
- <i>Rickon needs you.</i>

00:30:12.324 --> 00:30:14.258
He's six.

00:30:14.293 --> 00:30:17.695
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.164
- clutching my leg, crying--
- close the windows!

00:30:20.199 --> 00:30:22.367
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

00:30:26.071 --> 00:30:28.573
Fire.

00:30:28.607 --> 00:30:30.775
You stay here.
I'll come back.

00:30:48.494 --> 00:30:50.995
You're not supposed
to be here.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.731
No one is
supposed to be here.

00:30:53.799 --> 00:30:57.368
It's a mercy.
He's dead already.

00:31:00.039 --> 00:31:02.740
No!

00:32:08.474 --> 00:32:12.243
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

00:32:12.277 --> 00:32:15.313
<i>Everywhere?</i>
<i>Even in the east?</i>

00:32:15.347 --> 00:32:18.282
<i>No dragon.</i>
<i>Brave men kill them.</i>

00:32:18.317 --> 00:32:21.519
- <i>It is known.</i>
- It is known.

00:32:21.553 --> 00:32:25.590
A trader from Garth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

00:32:25.624 --> 00:32:27.959
The moon?

00:32:28.026 --> 00:32:30.194
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

00:32:30.229 --> 00:32:33.264
<i>that once there were</i>
<i>two moons in the sky.</i>

00:32:33.298 --> 00:32:37.135
But one wandered too close
to the sun and it cracked from the heat.

00:32:37.169 --> 00:32:40.404
Out of it poured a thousand
thousand dragons

00:32:40.439 --> 00:32:42.373
and they drank
the sun's fire.

00:32:42.407 --> 00:32:45.309
Moon is no egg.

00:32:45.344 --> 00:32:48.179
Moon is goddess--
wife of sun.

00:32:48.213 --> 00:32:50.982
- It is known.
- It is known.

00:32:52.518 --> 00:32:54.485
Leave me with her.

00:33:02.327 --> 00:33:05.596
Why did the trader from Garth
tell you these stories?

00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:08.833
Men like to talk
when they're happy.

00:33:08.867 --> 00:33:10.902
Before your brother
bought me for you,

00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:13.004
it was my job
to make men happy.

00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:16.240
- How old were you?
- I was nine

00:33:16.275 --> 00:33:18.276
when my mother sold me
to the pleasure house.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.811
Nine?!

00:33:19.845 --> 00:33:23.281
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

00:33:23.315 --> 00:33:24.849
First

00:33:24.883 --> 00:33:26.851
you must learn.

00:33:29.688 --> 00:33:33.191
Can you teach me how
to make the Khal happy?

00:33:34.393 --> 00:33:38.296
- Yes.
- Will it take three years?

00:33:39.698 --> 00:33:41.365
No.

00:34:02.821 --> 00:34:05.022
Welcome.

00:35:35.414 --> 00:35:38.983
What I am about to tell
you must remain between us.

00:35:40.485 --> 00:35:43.120
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.

00:35:44.323 --> 00:35:46.324
I think he was thrown.

00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:50.428
The boy was always
sure-footed before.

00:35:50.462 --> 00:35:53.197
Someone tried
to kill him twice.

00:35:53.231 --> 00:35:56.334
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Why murder an innocent child?</i>

00:35:56.368 --> 00:35:59.103
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

00:35:59.137 --> 00:36:01.839
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

00:36:03.408 --> 00:36:05.643
<i>But I would stake my life</i>
<i>the Lannisters are involved.</i>

00:36:05.677 --> 00:36:09.113
We already have reason
to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

00:36:09.147 --> 00:36:11.449
Did you notice the dagger
the killer used?

00:36:11.483 --> 00:36:13.918
It's too fine a weapon
for such a man.

00:36:13.952 --> 00:36:17.254
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:19.190
Someone gave it to him.

00:36:20.592 --> 00:36:24.128
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

00:36:24.162 --> 00:36:26.383
If it's war they want--

00:36:26.408 --> 00:36:28.096
If it comes to that, you know
I'll stand behind you.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.968
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

00:36:31.003 --> 00:36:32.970
<i>Huh?</i>

00:36:33.005 --> 00:36:35.973
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

00:36:36.008 --> 00:36:38.042
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>the truth yet.</i>

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.644
Lord Stark
must be told of this.

00:36:40.679 --> 00:36:43.614
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

00:36:43.648 --> 00:36:45.549
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

00:36:45.584 --> 00:36:48.886
There must always be
a Stark in Winterfell.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.222
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

00:36:51.289 --> 00:36:53.424
I must.

00:36:53.458 --> 00:36:56.160
I'll send hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

00:36:56.194 --> 00:36:58.696
Too large a party attracts
unwanted attention.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.032
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

00:37:01.066 --> 00:37:02.900
Let me accompany you
at least.

00:37:02.934 --> 00:37:05.836
<i>The Kingsroad can be a</i>
<i>dangerous place for a woman alone.</i>

00:37:09.574 --> 00:37:11.909
What about Bran?

00:37:13.445 --> 00:37:16.547
I have prayed to the seven
for more than a month.

00:37:17.716 --> 00:37:21.085
<i>Bran's life is</i>
<i>in their hands now.</i>

00:38:19.778 --> 00:38:22.046
No, Khaleesi.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.882
You must look
in his eyes always.

00:38:24.916 --> 00:38:26.951
Love comes in at the eyes.

00:38:26.985 --> 00:38:31.422
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

00:38:31.456 --> 00:38:33.491
with nothing
but her eyes.

00:38:33.525 --> 00:38:35.826
Finish a man?

00:38:37.329 --> 00:38:39.430
Oh.

00:38:39.464 --> 00:38:44.001
Kings traveled across
the world for a night with Irogenia.

00:38:44.035 --> 00:38:46.670
Magisters sold
their palaces.

00:38:46.705 --> 00:38:50.441
<i>Khals burned her enemies</i>
<i>just to have her for a few hours.</i>

00:38:50.475 --> 00:38:54.245
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

00:38:54.279 --> 00:38:57.114
and she refused them all.

00:38:57.149 --> 00:39:00.718
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

00:39:00.752 --> 00:39:02.686
I-- I don't think

00:39:02.721 --> 00:39:04.989
that Drogo will like it
with me on top.

00:39:05.023 --> 00:39:07.525
You will make him
like it, Khaleesi.

00:39:07.559 --> 00:39:09.793
Men want what
they've never had.

00:39:09.828 --> 00:39:13.030
And the Dothraki take slaves
like a hound takes a bitch.

00:39:13.064 --> 00:39:16.534
Are you a slave,
Khaleesi?

00:39:27.145 --> 00:39:30.014
Then don't make love
like a slave.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.758
Very good, Khaleesi.

00:39:40.792 --> 00:39:42.960
Out there
he is the mighty Khal,

00:39:42.994 --> 00:39:47.064
<i>but in this tent,</i>
<i>he belongs to you.</i>

00:39:47.098 --> 00:39:49.333
I-- I don't think

00:39:49.367 --> 00:39:51.435
that this is
the Dothraki way.

00:39:51.469 --> 00:39:54.038
If he wanted
the Dothraki way,

00:39:54.072 --> 00:39:57.074
why did he marry you?

00:40:45.523 --> 00:40:48.392
No.

00:40:50.795 --> 00:40:52.696
No!

00:40:52.731 --> 00:40:57.401
<i>Ajjalan anha zalat</i>
<i>vitiherat yer hatif.</i>

00:42:43.842 --> 00:42:45.676
Pardon me, Ser.

00:42:49.514 --> 00:42:51.849
Do I frighten you
so much, girl?

00:42:53.551 --> 00:42:56.320
Or is it him there
making you shake?

00:42:56.354 --> 00:42:58.956
He frightens
me too.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.458
Look at
that face.

00:43:01.493 --> 00:43:04.261
I'm sorry
if I offended you, Ser.

00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:12.837
Why won't he speak to me?

00:43:12.838 --> 00:43:15.038
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

00:43:15.039 --> 00:43:18.108
Since the mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

00:43:18.143 --> 00:43:20.878
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

00:43:20.912 --> 00:43:24.681
Ser Ilyn Payne,
the King's justice.

00:43:26.184 --> 00:43:28.318
The royal
executioner.

00:43:29.621 --> 00:43:32.790
What is it, sweet lady?

00:43:34.359 --> 00:43:36.427
Does the hound frighten you?

00:43:36.461 --> 00:43:38.162
Away with you, dog.

00:43:38.196 --> 00:43:40.864
You're scaring
my lady.

00:43:43.067 --> 00:43:45.202
I don't like
to see you upset.

00:43:47.705 --> 00:43:49.506
The Sun is finally shining.

00:43:49.541 --> 00:43:51.308
Come walk with me.

00:43:53.244 --> 00:43:55.379
Stay, lady.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:14.231
I probably shouldn't
have any more.

00:44:14.265 --> 00:44:16.633
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

00:44:16.668 --> 00:44:19.736
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.918
Don't worry--
you're safe with me.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.021
I'll get you!

00:44:43.194 --> 00:44:46.129
- Arya!
- Ow!

00:44:46.164 --> 00:44:47.731
What are you doing here?

00:44:47.765 --> 00:44:50.234
- Go away.
- Your sister?

00:44:53.972 --> 00:44:56.773
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my Lord.

00:44:56.808 --> 00:44:58.909
- He the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

00:44:58.943 --> 00:45:02.412
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a Knight, eh?

00:45:04.015 --> 00:45:06.850
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

00:45:06.885 --> 00:45:09.486
She asked me to, my Lord.
She asked me to.

00:45:09.521 --> 00:45:11.488
I'm your prince,

00:45:11.523 --> 00:45:13.457
not your lord,

00:45:13.491 --> 00:45:17.094
and I said pick up
your sword.

00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:19.496
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

00:45:19.531 --> 00:45:21.398
And you're not a Knight.

00:45:22.734 --> 00:45:24.968
Only a butcher's boy.

00:45:25.003 --> 00:45:28.038
That was my lady's sister
you were hitting, do you know that?

00:45:28.072 --> 00:45:30.407
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

00:45:31.342 --> 00:45:33.110
I won't hurt him...

00:45:33.144 --> 00:45:34.745
Much.

00:45:43.254 --> 00:45:44.521
Arya!

00:45:45.523 --> 00:45:46.924
Filthy little bitch!

00:45:46.958 --> 00:45:48.859
No no, stop it, stop it,
both of you.

00:45:48.893 --> 00:45:52.229
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

00:45:52.263 --> 00:45:54.898
I'll gut you,
you little cunt!

00:45:57.602 --> 00:45:59.703
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

00:45:59.737 --> 00:46:02.306
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

00:46:07.178 --> 00:46:09.112
No.

00:46:09.147 --> 00:46:11.748
No.
Please don't.

00:46:11.783 --> 00:46:14.217
Arya, leave him alone.

00:46:32.804 --> 00:46:36.273
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

00:46:36.307 --> 00:46:38.742
Stay here, I'll go back
to the inn and bring help.

00:46:38.776 --> 00:46:40.110
Then go!

00:46:41.913 --> 00:46:44.348
Don't touch me.

00:46:46.351 --> 00:46:49.319
<i>The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.</i>

00:46:55.326 --> 00:46:59.296
You've got to go. They'll kill you for
what you did to Joffrey.

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:01.465
Go on-- run.

00:47:04.569 --> 00:47:06.737
Go!
Leave now!

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.308
- <i>It's a direwolf.</i>
- <i>I'll check down here.</i>

00:47:16.881 --> 00:47:20.484
<i>I think I heard a noise.</i>

00:47:22.053 --> 00:47:23.687
<i>Go!</i>

00:47:35.667 --> 00:47:38.802
<i>Arya!</i>

00:47:38.836 --> 00:47:43.540
- Distant man: <i>Arya!</i>
- Ned: <i>Arya!</i>

00:47:43.574 --> 00:47:46.476
<i>Arya-aa!</i>

00:47:47.612 --> 00:47:49.680
Arya!

00:47:49.714 --> 00:47:51.448
<i>Arya!</i>

00:47:51.482 --> 00:47:53.417
My lord!

00:47:53.451 --> 00:47:55.852
My lord!
They found her.

00:47:55.887 --> 00:47:58.355
She's unharmed.

00:47:58.389 --> 00:47:59.907
Where is she?

00:47:59.932 --> 00:48:01.658
She's been taken
directly before the King.

00:48:01.713 --> 00:48:03.547
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

00:48:03.823 --> 00:48:05.991
- <i>Arya-aa!</i>
- Right, get back.

00:48:06.061 --> 00:48:08.441
<i>The Queen ordered</i>
<i>them to bring her straight to him.</i>

00:48:08.662 --> 00:48:10.897
Back!
Back to the inn.

00:48:11.102 --> 00:48:12.969
All back!

00:48:20.611 --> 00:48:22.479
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

00:48:22.513 --> 00:48:24.247
<i>- Are you hurt?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

00:48:24.282 --> 00:48:26.817
Oh, it's all right.

00:48:28.519 --> 00:48:31.254
What is
the meaning of this?

00:48:31.322 --> 00:48:34.041
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

00:48:34.415 --> 00:48:36.055
How dare you speak
to your King in that manner?

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.280
Quiet, woman.

00:48:38.229 --> 00:48:41.131
Sorry, Ned.
I never meant to frighten the girl.

00:48:41.165 --> 00:48:43.433
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

00:48:43.501 --> 00:48:47.070
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

00:48:47.105 --> 00:48:49.740
That animal of hers
nearly tore his arm off.

00:48:49.774 --> 00:48:51.708
That's not true!

00:48:51.743 --> 00:48:54.211
She just...
Bit him a little.

00:48:54.245 --> 00:48:57.848
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

00:48:57.882 --> 00:48:59.783
You and that boy
beat him with clubs

00:48:59.817 --> 00:49:02.686
- while you set your wolf on him.
- That's not what happened!

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.346
Yes it is!

00:49:04.371 --> 00:49:06.121
They all attacked me and she
threw my sword in the river.

00:49:06.124 --> 00:49:07.390
- Liar!
- Shut up!

00:49:07.425 --> 00:49:08.825
<i>Enough!</i>

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.895
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

00:49:11.929 --> 00:49:14.297
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

00:49:16.367 --> 00:49:18.425
Where's your
other daughter, Ned?

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:19.802
In bed asleep.

00:49:20.265 --> 00:49:21.566
She's not.

00:49:22.458 --> 00:49:24.793
Sansa, come here, darling.

00:49:34.752 --> 00:49:36.753
Now, child...

00:49:37.655 --> 00:49:39.723
Tell me what happened.

00:49:39.757 --> 00:49:41.825
Tell it all
and tell it true.

00:49:41.859 --> 00:49:44.494
It's a great crime
to lie to a King.

00:49:52.904 --> 00:49:54.838
I don't know.

00:49:54.872 --> 00:49:58.308
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:01.678
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

00:50:01.712 --> 00:50:03.180
- Liar liar liar!
- Arya!

00:50:03.214 --> 00:50:05.515
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar liar liar!

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:09.911
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

00:50:09.988 --> 00:50:11.009
<i>I want her punished.</i>

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.742
What would you have me do,
whip her through the streets?

00:50:14.264 --> 00:50:16.966
Damn it, children fight.
It's over.

00:50:17.002 --> 00:50:19.604
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

00:50:21.273 --> 00:50:24.909
You let that
little girl disarm you?

00:50:30.916 --> 00:50:34.052
Ned, see to it that
your daughter is disciplined.

00:50:34.086 --> 00:50:36.955
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, your Grace.

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:40.825
And what of the direwolf?

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.461
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

00:50:46.332 --> 00:50:48.833
I'd forgot
the damned wolf.

00:50:48.868 --> 00:50:51.636
We found no trace
of the direwolf, your Grace.

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:54.939
No?
So be it.

00:50:54.974 --> 00:50:57.142
We have another wolf.

00:51:00.446 --> 00:51:02.080
As you will.

00:51:02.114 --> 00:51:05.316
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

00:51:05.351 --> 00:51:07.786
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

00:51:08.921 --> 00:51:11.289
He doesn't mean Lady,
does he?

00:51:11.323 --> 00:51:14.325
No no, not lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.261
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

00:51:16.295 --> 00:51:19.664
- <i>You leave her alone!</i>
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

00:51:19.732 --> 00:51:22.467
Please please,
it wasn't Lady!

00:51:22.501 --> 00:51:24.002
Is this your command--

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:26.604
your Grace?

00:51:33.012 --> 00:51:36.548
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, your Grace.

00:51:36.582 --> 00:51:38.750
Ser Ilyn,
do me the honor.

00:51:38.784 --> 00:51:41.085
No.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.488
Jory...

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:46.624
Take the girls
to their rooms.

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.431
If it must be done,

00:51:53.465 --> 00:51:55.433
then I'll do it myself.

00:51:55.467 --> 00:51:57.669
Is this some trick?

00:51:57.703 --> 00:52:00.638
The wolf is of the north.

00:52:00.673 --> 00:52:03.775
She deserves better
than a butcher.

00:52:37.142 --> 00:52:39.077
The butcher's boy--

00:52:39.144 --> 00:52:40.812
you rode him down?

00:52:40.846 --> 00:52:42.981
He ran...

00:52:43.015 --> 00:52:44.716
Not very fast.

00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:19.231
