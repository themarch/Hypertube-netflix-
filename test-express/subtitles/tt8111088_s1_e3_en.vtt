WEBVTT

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.335
There is one job.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:07.593
Underworld?

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.884
Face to face.

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:15.347
Bounty hunting
is a complicated profession.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:18.272
Proof of termination

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.900
is also acceptable for a lower fee.

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:27.438
My ship
has been destroyed. I'm trapped here.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.093
These are my parts.
They stole them from me.

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:45.249
You can trade.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.879
The egg? What egg?

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:14.092
Mando. I've received your transmission.
Wonderful news.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.639
Upon your return, deliver the quarry
directly to the client.

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:23.193
I have no idea if he wants
to eat it or hang it on his wall,

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.898
but he's very antsy.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.188
Safe passage! You know where to find me.

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:34.739
It's not a toy.

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.691
Easy with that.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.731
You take it easy.

00:05:22.573 --> 00:05:23.573
Yes!

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:27.493
Yes, yes, yes!

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.630
Yes.

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:47.681
Very healthy. Yes.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.520
Your reputation was not unwarranted.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.480
How many fobs did you give out?

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:01.698
This asset
was of extreme importance to me.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.488
I had to ensure its delivery.

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:08.414
But to the winner...

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:12.706
Go the spoils.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:38.362
Such a large bounty
for such a small package.

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:58.747
What are your plans for it?

00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:04.131
How uncharacteristic
of one of your reputation.

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:08.222
You have taken both commission
and payment.

00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:14.558
Is it not the Code of the Guild
that these events are now forgotten?

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:22.694
That Beskar is enough to make
a handsome replacement for your armor.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:28.573
Unfortunately, finding a Mandalorian
in these trying times

00:07:29.575 --> 00:07:32.995
is more difficult than finding the steel.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.515
This amount can be shaped many ways.

00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:22.855
My armor has lost
its integrity. I may need to begin again.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:27.194
Indeed.
I can form a full cuirass.

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.856
This would be in order for your station.

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:32.655
That would be a great honor.

00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:36.655
I must warn you.
It will draw many eyes.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.040
These were cast
in an Imperial smelter.

00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:48.763
These are the spoils of the Great Purge.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.590
The reason that we live hidden
like sand rats.

00:09:55.012 --> 00:10:00.642
Our secrecy is our survival.
Our survival is our strength.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.523
Our strength was once in our numbers.

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:07.614
Now we live in the shadows
and only come above ground one at a time.

00:10:09.193 --> 00:10:13.953
Our world was shattered by the Empire,
with whom this coward shares tables.

00:10:30.214 --> 00:10:32.174
The Empire is no longer.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.301
And the Beskar has returned.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:40.223
When one chooses to walk
the Way of the Mandalore,

00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:43.517
you are both hunter and prey.

00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:47.983
How can one be a coward
if one chooses this way of life?

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.565
Have you ever removed your helmet?

00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:52.855
No.

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:54.855
Has it ever been removed
by others?

00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:57.573
Never.

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.292
This is the Way.

00:11:00.369 --> 00:11:02.289
This is the Way.

00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:05.002
This is the Way.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:09.923
What caused this damage?

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:11.922
A Mudhorn.

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:16.433
Then you have earned
the Mudhorn as your signet.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.300
I shall craft it.

00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:22.057
I can't accept.
It wasn't a noble kill.

00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:26.727
I was helped by an enemy.

00:11:26.812 --> 00:11:29.232
Why would an enemy
help you in battle?

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.983
It did not know it was my enemy.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:39.531
Since you forgo a signet,

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:43.326
I shall use the excess
to forge whistling birds.

00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:45.582
Whistling birds will do well.

00:11:45.664 --> 00:11:47.624
Reserve some for the foundlings.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:52.168
As it should always be.
The foundlings are the future.

00:11:52.254 --> 00:11:53.384
This is the Way.

00:11:53.964 --> 00:11:55.474
This is the Way.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.549
This is the Way.

00:12:22.326 --> 00:12:26.616
Whistling birds are a powerful
defense against multiple enemies.

00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:30.673
Use them sparingly, for they are rare.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:59.128
Look, I told you.
I'm not interested in your excuses!

00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:05.215
You had your shot,
dust breather, but you failed.

00:14:05.304 --> 00:14:07.764
No pucks for you. Now get outta here.

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:35.964
Ah! Mando!

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:42.219
They all hate you, Mando.
Because you're a legend!

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:44.589
How many of them had tracking fobs?

00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:50.888
All of them. All of them!
But not one of them closed the deal.

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:53.194
Only you, Mando. Only you.

00:14:54.478 --> 00:14:55.478
And with it,

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.942
the richest reward
this parsec has ever seen.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.573
Please sit, my friend.

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:08.994
They're all weighing the Beskar
in their minds, but not me.

00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:12.786
No. I, for one, I celebrate your success.

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.501
Because it is my success as well.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:20.174
Hell! Even I am rich.

00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:25.344
Now, how can I show my gratitude
to my most valuable partner?

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.585
I want my next job.

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.008
Next job?

00:15:31.807 --> 00:15:35.097
Take some time off. Enjoy yourself.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:40.482
I'll take you to
the Twi'lek healing baths.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.986
I want my next job.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:45.856
Sure. Fine.

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.823
You hunters like to keep busy, right?

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:52.697
Well, these are all far away.

00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:54.999
The further, the better.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.370
Well, take your pick. You've earned it.

00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:06.721
Ah. That's the best one of the lot.
A nobleman's son skipped bail.

00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:11.221
Looks like you're headed
to the ocean dunes of Karnac.

00:16:18.437 --> 00:16:20.397
Any idea what they're gonna do with it?

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:22.315
With what?

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:25.936
The kid.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.700
I didn't ask. It's against the Guild Code.

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:33.454
They work for the Empire.
What are they doing here?

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:36.035
The Empire is gone, Mando.

00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:40.248
All that are left
are mercenaries and warlords.

00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:42.254
But if it bothers you,

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:46.126
just go back to the Core and report them
to the New Republic.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.263
That's a joke.

00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:51.352
Mando, enjoy your rewards.

00:16:53.222 --> 00:16:55.102
Buy a camtono of spice.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:01.360
By the time you come out of hyperdrive,
you will have forgotten all about it.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.420
I don't care.

00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:35.224
I order you to extract the
necessary material and be done with it.

00:19:38.262 --> 00:19:41.062
He has explicitly ordered us
to bring it back alive.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:46.349
Finish your business quickly,
as I no longer can guarantee your safety.

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:04.368
Check the perimeter.

00:21:34.962 --> 00:21:38.342
No, no, no, no, please.
Please. No. No, no.

00:21:39.675 --> 00:21:40.755
No, please.

00:21:40.843 --> 00:21:43.433
Please don't hurt him. It's just a child.

00:21:43.512 --> 00:21:47.932
Please. No. No! Please. No. No, no.

00:21:56.108 --> 00:21:58.898
What did you do to it?
What did you do it?

00:21:58.986 --> 00:22:01.106
I protected him. I protected him.

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:03.986
If it wasn't for me,
he would already be dead!

00:22:04.533 --> 00:22:07.333
Please! Please. Please.

00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:36.319
Look, there!

00:22:39.943 --> 00:22:41.703
Split up.
We'll flush him out.

00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:42.908
Copy.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.710
Give it up. There's nowhere to...

00:23:00.297 --> 00:23:01.797
Hey!

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:42.760
Freeze!

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.630
Don't move.

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:45.716
Hands up.

00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:47.091
Drop the blaster.

00:23:47.177 --> 00:23:49.927
Wait.
What I'm holding is very valuable.

00:23:50.556 --> 00:23:51.556
Here.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.440
Now turn and face me.

00:24:07.489 --> 00:24:09.069
Stand up!

00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:53.723
Welcome back, Mando!

00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:57.392
Now put the package down.

00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:02.976
Step aside.
I'm going to my ship.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.990
You put the bounty down
and perhaps I'll let you pass.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.990
The kid's coming with me.

00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:15.832
If you truly care about the kid,
then you'll put it on the speeder

00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:18.365
and we'll discuss terms.

00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:22.669
How do I know I can trust you?

00:26:22.749 --> 00:26:25.669
Because I'm your only hope.

00:27:02.664 --> 00:27:04.714
Drive.

00:27:04.791 --> 00:27:05.791
Drive!

00:28:14.111 --> 00:28:15.741
That's one impressive weapon!

00:28:16.488 --> 00:28:18.368
Here's what I'll do.

00:28:18.448 --> 00:28:22.488
I'm gonna walk to my ship with the kid
and you're gonna let it happen.

00:28:23.787 --> 00:28:26.287
No. How about this?

00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:29.457
We take the kid,

00:28:29.543 --> 00:28:34.633
and if you try to stop us, we kill you
and we strip your body for parts.

00:28:42.848 --> 00:28:44.218
Don't hit the target!

00:30:09.393 --> 00:30:12.653
Get out of here!
We'll hold them off!

00:30:12.729 --> 00:30:15.069
You're going
to have to relocate the covert.

00:30:15.566 --> 00:30:17.186
This is the Way.

00:30:17.276 --> 00:30:18.986
This is the Way.

00:30:40.966 --> 00:30:42.926
Hold it, Mando.

00:30:46.096 --> 00:30:47.886
I didn't want it to come to this.

00:30:49.516 --> 00:30:51.136
But then you broke the Code.

00:32:02.047 --> 00:32:03.507
I gotta get one of those.
